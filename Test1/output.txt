Speaker A: Minis are off though.
Speaker B: I've.
Speaker C: I just been sitting here waiting for the podcast to start chilling. I fell asleep in this chair for a while. That's what I've been doing.
Speaker B: Welcome to the podcast.
Speaker C: How you guys feeling today?
Speaker B: I'm feeling great.
Speaker D: Good.
Speaker B: Sunburn.
Speaker C: It's Mega 64 day, everyone.
Speaker B: Welcome. It is. It really is.
Speaker C: Is.
Speaker B: It's like a better Christmas today.
Speaker D: More important than Christmas?
Speaker B: More important.
Speaker C: Yeah. This commemorates a more significant know. Obviously Christmas is the birth of Santa Claus, right? And the invention of presents, which is cool. Everybody loves that. But this is the day that honors. Was that.
Speaker D: Sorry.
Speaker C: Really necessary?
Speaker D: Yes, it was bugging me.
Speaker B: We were talking about how wasn't even on camera and then you.
Speaker D: It was on camera.
Speaker C: No, that's the trash that you missed. That's still on camera.
Speaker B: See, that would have been way easier.
Speaker C: Anyways, this is an important day, mega 64 day. And we're doing a very special podcast just for you all. Just to thank you for spending the day with us here today. How have you guys been celebrating Mega 64 day? You've been like revisiting your favorite Mega 64 memories.
Speaker B: I have. And then this morning I played God of War for 2 hours on a stream.
Speaker C: I was there for some of that.
Speaker B: Kevin was there for some. Rocco was there. Yeah, everyone was there. And so I'm playing that game. So I'm like 3 hours into God of war and that's how I celebrated. Makes 54 day. What a way to start.
Speaker C: Beautiful. I need a time out for a second. You guys keep going. I'll be back in like 90 seconds.
Speaker B: Okay. Rocco, you were here earlier, I guess I'd say last night, starting the stream. So you were there for the launch of it? I'll say, yeah. So that was cool. I was at home watching. I was not here, but I was there in spirit and I was enjoying everything that you were doing.
Speaker C: Frank played.
Speaker B: What was that you were playing? Tony Hawk underground.
Speaker A: I played Tony Hawk underground, one of the best games ever made. We streamed for like two and a half hours. We played Tony Hawk underground and two extreme for Playstation one. It was pretty cool.
Speaker B: Dang. Hell yeah. Hell yeah. So, yeah, that's cool. Yes, I'm going great. Honestly, I don't wait for Derek to come back. But I'll say it. Fuck him. The outpour of people saying that. Hey, we love you guys. Thanks for doing what you do. People have been so welcoming and warm this day.
Speaker C: Yeah, I've returned. And I brought a friend.
Speaker B: Who'd you bring? Hello, Meg.
Speaker D: Who is it?
Speaker B: Oh, Meg, welcome thanks. Welcome to the podcast.
Speaker C: Thank you.
Speaker B: Wow.
Speaker C: We're talking Mega 64 day.
Speaker B: Cool.
Speaker D: Yeah, I was blown away. This was something that we talked about for a while, and then it was kind of like, oh, it's coming up. Should we do something for it? Yeah, let's do something for it. Okay, cool. But I didn't really know how it was going to go.
Speaker B: Well, it started with us making fun of, like, international hiking day.
Speaker D: Yeah, stuff like that.
Speaker B: Why does that get a fucking day? That's stupid. And then we thought, well, why does that get a day when we don't have a day?
Speaker D: Yeah.
Speaker B: So we made our own day.
Speaker D: We made our own day June 4. And not only is it Mega 64 day, but we coined the new phrase. And I've been saying it all day. Maybe you guys want to start, too. June the fourth, be with you.
Speaker B: Oh, I won't be.
Speaker D: So it's kind of a fun thing to say.
Speaker B: You have sole ownership of that one.
Speaker C: I thought when people said, may the fourth be with you.
Speaker B: Yeah.
Speaker C: Correct me if I'm wrong, Rocco. I thought you really effing hated that.
Speaker D: Yeah, I do.
Speaker A: Okay.
Speaker B: That's all.
Speaker C: No, I don't want any. I just wanted to confirm.
Speaker D: Badass.
Speaker A: June the fourth, be with you, is kind of like. That's like gamer talk. It's like a secret gamer code.
Speaker D: Yeah, it's like gamers.
Speaker B: We gamer fuel.
Speaker D: All you Australians out there, how are you like an I snack 2.0? Now, none of these Americans, no idea.
Speaker B: What the fuck you're saying, but all.
Speaker D: The Australians high fived me just now. Thank you.
Speaker B: Cool. Five of them.
Speaker C: Did you do that weird thing where you pinch the fat between their thumb and the forefinger?
Speaker D: Oh, yeah, man. You know, that still works.
Speaker C: Works as in, still disgust. Anybody who.
Speaker D: Everybody who tried to shake my hands at this last packs, they got. I just. Right here. They go in. Kevin, are you getting a close up on that? In case anybody doesn't know, that's the secret handshake is they go in for the handshake and they'll never forget you.
Speaker B: Great, because they look at me every time Rocco does it. I need to own up to what he fucking did. And I just go, I'm sorry.
Speaker C: Yeah, that's the worst part. Rocco always does it. And the person shaking Rocco's hand looks to me or Sean for an explanation.
Speaker B: And it's like, inevitably.
Speaker C: And we just always have to be like, yeah, that's what he does to everybody. Don't worry about it.
Speaker B: He's an idiot.
Speaker D: Sorry, but that's not how they remember me. They remember me as being different than the pack, being the rogue.
Speaker B: They don't say that to you. They just look at. They just think, what the fuck was.
Speaker C: You're like Rocco solo, and now we know how you got your name.
Speaker D: Yeah. And thank God, because, you know. But anyway, you know, I shook the hand once of a very important person in a very important industry.
Speaker B: Obama.
Speaker C: Next story.
Speaker D: I'm not going to announce, I'm not.
Speaker B: Going to say whom.
Speaker D: But it was so at the gas station. Yeah. It was so, like, limp and terrible that I never forgot it. And I thought, I can do that.
Speaker C: Brother Rocco met Mitt Romney once at.
Speaker B: A gas station, the one by our old office. Oh, God. Yeah. What was he doing over there?
Speaker C: That's why we said he wasn't.
Speaker D: He was there with his wife.
Speaker B: No.
Speaker C: They must have been out on a date.
Speaker B: Mitt Romney's not going to that arco by the love boutique.
Speaker C: I don't think so. Date night with miss.
Speaker B: What were they doing?
Speaker C: Getting dildos?
Speaker D: Getting gas at a gas station.
Speaker B: They were getting sex toys and then tank low.
Speaker D: Everybody knows, I think because there was an airport near there.
Speaker C: Well, you could say that about anything. There was a 711 near there, too. And an in and out. We can't speculate why they were there, but we know they were there.
Speaker D: Yeah.
Speaker B: Got it.
Speaker C: Anyways.
Speaker D: What are we going to be.
Speaker C: Doing after this stream? Should we do a little foreshadowing here?
Speaker D: I think it'd be cool to watch some old videos or something like that. Okay, that'll be kind of our sort of after show this week. But either way, like we were saying, couldn't be more grateful. Again, this was just something we decided to do. We were having a laugh about may the fourth be with you. Shit. Whatever. We did our own day. Okay, fine. But just like all these people on Twitter and Facebook and all these big youtubers and stuff that have way more subscribers than us are like, hey, these guys. Like, I used to watch these guys nonstop. I don't know. All the outpouring of support has been like, unbelievable.
Speaker B: Yeah. That was not something we intended.
Speaker D: No, not at all.
Speaker B: Honestly, we thought, like, hey, let's have a dumb day ourselves. Let's put some cool stuff on sale, and then let's just hang out and chill all day.
Speaker C: You know what I'd like is for the website that lists every day, because there's the catalog of every day. They need to add mega 64 day to June.
Speaker B: I think they will.
Speaker C: Yeah, they better do it if they don't do that. Then today was a failure. That's true. So we need everybody out there to email that website. Carl, whoever they are, find that website and let them know what we're doing and what we expect them to do to honor us. Thank you.
Speaker D: Thank you anyway. And thank you to everybody watching this. And again, if you're watching this live right now, all the exclusive stuff we put in the store is there.
Speaker B: Oh, yeah.
Speaker D: Still. So go check that out.
Speaker C: Which shirt? Because we have dueling shirt design just for today. Which one is winning right now? Do we know?
Speaker D: Do we have any by a sliver? And, I mean, it's so split. It's by, like, three shirts of the variant, like, video tv shirts that you put out. The red one, the one with the red 64, the clean one that is barely edging out.
Speaker B: If I were to buy one, I would buy that one. That's me.
Speaker C: See, I would go with the zebra print.
Speaker D: I like the zebra print.
Speaker C: That's my style.
Speaker B: If you look at our styles, I think everyone would have guessed that. I think everyone would have said that's what we would have picked. Kevin would pick the one I picked.
Speaker C: You know what? I'm actually. That we put it as a competition because if it was just left to me, it would just be the zebra one. But apparently the other one is more popular, so it's for the best.
Speaker B: And it could go back and forth.
Speaker C: It could go back and forth, but it's for the best that we leave it to the people. That way, we get the final word on which one is the better shirt.
Speaker D: I got to say, though, going back to kind of. Again, this is really our 15th anniversary around now. Honestly, it already technically happened. We were filming stuff at the beginning of 2003. Whatever. But summer is kind of when our videos popped off, and it's really been crazy again, 15 years. It's hard to imagine that. I don't know where I was going with that. I had a whole thing I was going to say. Well, oh, man. I got overwhelmed by, like, all of a sudden, I realized it was like, oh, wow, it's happening.
Speaker C: Pretty soon it's going to be 20 years. Omega 64.
Speaker B: That's such a fucking long time. Especially when we started. If you would have said 15 years bums me out.
Speaker D: What?
Speaker C: PewDiepie was around for, like, three years and became number one youtuber in the world. We should have been number one youtuber of the world five times over by now.
Speaker B: Sure.
Speaker D: Yeah.
Speaker C: I don't get it.
Speaker D: Well, maybe we. If he is. If you're talking YouTube subscriptions and money, but there's a lot of other categories you can factor in. I remember what I was going to say, okay, what I was going to say is, what's been funny about doing it this long and at the level that we're doing it, whatever. I remember when I was younger, I saw, you know, I discovered, like, weird Al Yankovic and his albums and stuff and just loved it. And what was really funny was discovering his career and watching him. I was a big fan, so I was always checking on what he was doing, and it was so funny watching the world go through this cycle of. He has a new album out. Weird Al is back. Wow. You thought he was dead? No, he's got a new album. This is amazing. And then he would put out the next album. Wow, he's back. You thought he had died 20 years ago. And it's like, no, he's always doing something. And I feel like sometimes we have that a little bit, I think to us and to honestly, probably most of the people watching this, it's an active thing, and that's great. But it really is funny seeing some people on social media and other places that are like, just saw our latest video and are like, yeah, these guys are. I can't believe, what a comeback. And it's like, whatever you want to call it, but I don't know, that kind of thing. That's always been entertaining to me. And there's sometimes I even get in my own head where I'm like, does the world care about Mega 64 anymore? But then you have a day like today, and there's e three coming up, and there's fun stuff going on during that. It's like, oh, shit, this is great. The support is just. I couldn't be more grateful. And then the next week, I'm sure we'll suck. It's a cycle, but that's what life is. It's cyclical. So it just goes to show you, if 1 minute you're like me, then tomorrow you're going to be like, but you know what?
Speaker B: That's kind of like when you are with someone or like, you like something when you're younger. Let's say, for example, the band bright eyes. I used to really like that band. Like, really, really used to like them. And now I don't give a. I've, I've grown past that. And I think, oh, bright Eyes has a new album coming out. It's like, oh, my God, he has a new album. Jesus Christ. For all I know, he's released an album every single year. But I have fallen off the bright Eyes train. And maybe he's, like, consistently killing it. I don't know. So maybe that's what people feel. Know, when you grow up a little bit, you feel like that was the old me. I'm not even that same person anymore. But we're better than bright eyes. I'm just saying that's what people know. Potentially. Not as sad. Not as sad. I'm a lot happier than Connor Oberst.
Speaker C: Are you?
Speaker B: Theme song Frank. Does it kiss your eyelids in the morning when you start to raise your head? And does these things do? And suddenly the space between your bed and walls. You walk around all day at school, looking down every few steps. You pretend he walks with you. Or does he know that place below your neck is your favorite to be touched? And as he cried through broken sentences like, I love you, fought too much.
Speaker D: Okay. I brought this up a thousand times. I know how I've looked on this podcast so far. I'm aware.
Speaker C: Yeah, you look great. Typical classic rock.
Speaker D: I got haters on the handshake. I got haters on a lot of stuff. Yeah, there's a lot of people are missing this right here. It's the whole thing. I got haters. Haters line up. Okay, but I'm going to say it. That. Fuck bright eyes. That was the worst era of music. There was a time where every one of my friends was all about bright eyes. And I felt like I was in the twilight zone. I felt like it was like eye of the beholder. And I'm like, I don't look like anybody else.
Speaker C: Good thing you made more friends than just me and Sean. That was a sad time.
Speaker B: I felt so much back then. Not anymore.
Speaker C: I love bright eyes then, and I still love bright eyes now.
Speaker D: I didn't understand it. That was one thing I just could not.
Speaker B: I'm going to play bright eyes nonstop now. I'm going to check it back in with Connor and see how he's doing.
Speaker D: There really was, like, everybody I knew was, like, super all about him. How many years ago?
Speaker C: And now it's Jack White. So I feel your pain.
Speaker B: See, we all have.
Speaker D: I don't actually know that many people that are that into Jack White, but.
Speaker C: Man, at that time, I couldn't get all my friends. I am obsessed.
Speaker A: How many of your friends are, like, way into blink 182?
Speaker B: Like, two. One.
Speaker D: All my friends were into blink 180.
Speaker C: That I understood in the day.
Speaker B: All of them. All of them in amount of the state. That was like freshman year for me. Everyone.
Speaker D: But I do feel like I know a lot of people who would scoff at them now, but as soon as one of their albums came on, they would be like, oh, yeah, turn that out.
Speaker B: I feel like blink one a two has gotten to the point now that the scoffing is gone and it's now just love for blink one a two.
Speaker C: I love Blink 182, but I don't. Like, there was a hill where. And the same thing happened to Weezer, where they became way more popular after this point in their timeline. And I fell off. Sure, for Weezer, Beverly Hills and on, it's like a whole different band, but that is their most successful era for them. And Blink 182, like, I don't know the name of the album, but songs like I miss you and all.
Speaker D: Yeah, that was all that.
Speaker C: Like, what was later self titled release.
Speaker A: Blink one eight two, which came out.
Speaker D: That was the end.
Speaker A: And the singles were feeling this and miss you and that's kind of more experimental and emo and not as great, but their earlier punk stuff is fantastic.
Speaker C: That was 2003. Wow, you really know a lot about Blinkwin.
Speaker B: Yeah. Take off your pants and jacket was, like, the last.
Speaker D: I agree. I did like that album. I did enjoy that album, but that.
Speaker B: Was even still on the cusp of, like, I'll listen to this, and there's still some good songs on it. But I wasn't, like, obsessed like I was.
Speaker D: For me, I liked that one more. That was my favorite. I think I got into them a little later than other people. I really liked that album, but I know the cluster. Yeah, but I know there are a lot of people who like the other earlier ones better.
Speaker B: I feel like this is a bad.
Speaker A: Choice to have me produce the podcast because I'm going to secretly turn everything into a blink one eight two fest. Let's move on.
Speaker D: I apologize with Weezer, too. Like, you mentioned Beverly Hills even before that, they had Green album and maladroid, which are usually not considered.
Speaker C: But I like those albums.
Speaker D: But that's what I was going to say is I don't hate those albums.
Speaker B: Green album is what got a lot of people into Weezer.
Speaker D: Yeah. Green album is still a good pop kind of rock album. They did good. Maladroy has. I think there's an article about this. I can't believe we're talking this much about Weezer, but there's an article about this online where they say Maladroid is how Weezer wanted to end up, where it's catchy songs, but there's a little more metal to them almost. The thing is, what are the songs fucking about? They're kind of, like, meaningless a little bit, but they're still catchy. That album has some catchy songs, but it kind of goes into metal a little bit. And it's like after that, they got negative feedback and went into this direction where they started having pop producers come in. And that's when you got Beverly Hills. And they said it was the feedback on Maloroid that made them go in this other direction where now, okay, but.
Speaker C: Guilty pleasure admission here. Weezer put out a song last year that I fucking loved.
Speaker D: Which one? Because I know a lot of people.
Speaker C: Have said they put out a song. They put out the album. I think it was called Pacific Daydream.
Speaker D: I know a lot of people love that.
Speaker C: And I listened to the album, I think, with you, or you played a couple songs from it early, before the album came out. They released a couple tracks. We're driving to LA. You played a couple. And one of them, I think it was called Beach Boys.
Speaker D: Beach Boys.
Speaker C: Beach Boys by Weasley.
Speaker D: Like that. Yeah, something like that.
Speaker C: I think. Yeah, it's a song about listening to the Beach Boys. And I really loved that song, and I was so embarrassed. In 2017, putting new Weezer on, driving down the road, like, I roll my windows down and turn it up, and I'm like, yeah, turn it up for the Beach Boys by Weezer. And then it clicks. I'm like. I'm like, blasting new Weezer. This is not, like, cool.
Speaker D: I know a lot of people that liked. I think it was the album right before that, the white Album or something, which Bruce said.
Speaker A: That album's fantastic.
Speaker D: Yeah, I know a lot of people that like that.
Speaker B: What a bold name.
Speaker D: That's what I thought. I kind of felt like somebody already did that. But I know a lot of people who really like that album, so. Yeah, I don't know. So I guess Weezer, I feel like Weezer has kind of settled back into maybe a little more something palpable for their fan base. But, yeah, for a while, I couldn't stand ratitude and shit. I could not.
Speaker C: What about Hurley?
Speaker D: Yeah, that Hurley was, like, unbearable.
Speaker C: Meg, what's your favorite Weezer album? Wow.
Speaker B: You don't have. I never claimed to like Weezer.
Speaker D: All right. Yeah, right. Okay. You know what's funny? Tell me out there, people, if you agree or disagree. Podcast question of the week is a very sensitive topic. My whole life, Pinkerton was my favorite. As I get older, blue is my favorite.
Speaker B: Blue has always been my favorite. So there you go. I'm a blue boy.
Speaker C: Here's my answer. You ready? In my mind, they are the same album.
Speaker B: Oh.
Speaker C: I discovered Weezer after both of those albums were out. So there was never a time where I had one and not the other. I got every Weezer song off Napster and I liked them all.
Speaker D: Yeah, that's true. I think I remember talking to you about that, where it was like to you, the track order wasn't even a thing. Yeah, you had all those at once.
Speaker C: Personally, I like Pinkerton a little bit better, but it's all the same era. First two Weezer albums, I think one was 94 and one was 96. And it's just golden years. Golden age for Weezer. Golden era. And that was when Matt Sharp, the bassist.
Speaker B: Yes.
Speaker C: That's the original lineup.
Speaker D: So that's like the best stuff.
Speaker C: That's just classic Weezer. To me, both those albums are Weezer perfection. Check those.
Speaker B: Band in high school. Then, like, emo bands like Bright Eyes.
Speaker D: Really?
Speaker C: Hell, yeah.
Speaker D: It really was. Most people that I know, and I know I sound like a dick when I. Whatever, but I'm really not even trying to sound. I honestly didn't. That was a movement I didn't understand. It's like I couldn't really grasp the hook of it.
Speaker A: Well, isn't that why you were, like, way into the Aquabast? Because that stuff was so sunny bright?
Speaker D: I guess so, yeah.
Speaker A: Because I was kind of the same way. I was fucking so into sca band, and then I didn't get into emo stuff until maybe post college. And now I listen to box car racers.
Speaker D: But I also feel like saying that.
Speaker C: Stop referencing blink 182 side project.
Speaker D: But I also feel like, though, that saying that has a little bit of an error of, like, I was happy you guys were sad. And that's not what I mean. I honestly wanted to understand.
Speaker C: Okay.
Speaker D: But I should say. But I should say I did give it a chance, too. Back in the day going on. I don't know if it was Napster at that time. Morpheus.
Speaker C: Morpheus.
Speaker D: I would get songs, know bright eye songs and check them. Honestly, I just. I never found a connection. However, lover I don't have to love was a fucking great song. And I should give credit where credit is due. That was the one that I actually did listen to a lot.
Speaker C: Hey, let's take a moment to be old, okay. And let's complain about modern music.
Speaker D: Okay, sounds good.
Speaker C: I have a topic. Band names today are terrible. Worse than fucking ever. There was a band on the radio.
Speaker B: I'm going to fuck this up.
Speaker C: And all their fans are going to.
Speaker B: Be like, you don't know what you're.
Speaker C: Talking about, but it was like Rainbow Kitten vomit.
Speaker D: What?
Speaker C: Something like that was the name of the band.
Speaker D: Love those guys.
Speaker C: And I've been joking for all month just about how shitty band names are. And you can't tell the difference between band names and their songs because it's all just fucking stupid. And today I got this text message and it said, right now, 91 x local radio station is playing a song by car seat headrest. That is the name of the band. Car seat headrest.
Speaker D: Okay.
Speaker C: And I'm just, do you take no effort at all to come up with a name? Our band is left click. And our song is banana split personality.
Speaker B: I think left.
Speaker C: That's the type of shit you hear on the radio now. New music coming from Polka Dot chair. This is slimy feet.
Speaker D: So I think I talked to you about this before, Derek, because we were talking, know, I'm a big fan anytime. Know Josh from Queens of the Stone Age or that guy can do no wrong. As far as I'm concerned. Everything that guy does, every movie makes, literally every to me is, without question, punch or kick.
Speaker B: He. Every kick he makes. Anyway, kick to be a fan of.
Speaker D: I don't know what they're referencing, frankly, but anyway. No, but the super group kind of with him and Dave Grohl and John Paul Jones was them crooked vultures. And I remember talking to you, it was just like, that's the name of the band, them crooked Vultures. And when we had a talk a long time ago about band names, what's going on? And then there was an interview with Josh and he said, yeah, we wanted our band to be called Caligula. But let me tell you about this, is that every good band name is taken by some shitty band somewhere. So if you want to name a band now, you're up a creek, you have to combine stupid work. Like, he talked about that. He said, that's a thing that's going on.
Speaker B: That makes sense. And hear me out for a second. Let's say, yeah, caligula is what the band they wanted. But now they go on the Internet and check, oh, there's like four caligulas. We can't. But back in the old day, you couldn't do that if the band was big and signed, okay, we know there's a name, but everyone else, who fucking knows, now there's like Twitter and web know, whatever. So it's like everyone now you have car seat headrests. Because it's like, okay, I don't fucking know.
Speaker C: So I don't know if I should say the name of the person or say the name of the band, but my best friend here in San Diego is lead singer and guitar player in a band.
Speaker B: Yeah.
Speaker C: Should I. I don't care. Should I give him a plug here?
Speaker B: I'm not upset by this.
Speaker D: Yeah, I think it's probably fine.
Speaker C: All right, you all remember John? John Wanzer, my good buddy. He has appeared in a lot of mega 64 videos. He played John in version. Was that version two? Version two.
Speaker D: And a dead version of himself.
Speaker C: Yes, that's right. He's always been a longtime musician. He started playing guitar in 6th grade, and he's really talented. He's been in a lot of bands, but his most recent band is this band called Sixes. This is the name of his band, Sixes.
Speaker D: Cool, good name.
Speaker C: I was Google searching them because I was trying to find their music to.
Speaker B: Listen to it online.
Speaker C: There is another band named Sixes in southern California. They may even be in San Diego. They're, like, on the outskirts of San Diego. And I talked to John about this, and he's like, you know what? I started the band and we picked our name, and we checked the Internet like crazy, and nobody had the name. And as soon as we started putting music out, this band, which had been around for like a year or so before us, started ramping up their Internet presence. So now they're just these two competing bands, and they're just trying to be the first one that gets really big with the name. So he's a race. It's a race to become more famous than the other one.
Speaker B: We have people who will help John. So let's make John the sixes that we care about.
Speaker C: But it's just so funny what you're talking about. That is like, yeah, you can't escape it. So that's why you get car seat headrests, and that's why you get open toed sandals as band names.
Speaker D: I want to say maybe I'm remembering wrong, but I think Josh Hami even specifically said in that interview, that's why you get chicken foot.
Speaker C: Well, there you go.
Speaker D: I think he honestly said that. He's like, you have a group of these talented musicians and they come out called chicken like. But that's where we're at. So I thought that was kind of interesting. Might be a slight answer to that.
Speaker C: Everybody out there look up sixes. I think their bandcamp is six. Six sixes.
Speaker B: Or sixes. Sixes. Sixes.
Speaker C: Their ep hiss came out a few months ago.
Speaker B: Okay. So if you're listening to them and if you see the other one, don't waste your time.
Speaker D: Is there anything else you don't like about modern music? Is there anything.
Speaker C: No, that's literally just the names. Just the names. I feel like I love the music.
Speaker B: I feel like he just meet me in the middle. I'm losing my mind just a little.
Speaker C: So good with living in the best era of music of all time. And I'm not being facetious. Okay, maybe some people disagree.
Speaker D: I feel like I just can't really get into a lot of modern day rap. Like a lot of the new rap that's out.
Speaker C: So disappointing to hear you say that.
Speaker D: I just feel like kind of sounds the same. And it's funny, I never really liked rap back, way back then in the early two thousand s. I feel like.
Speaker C: There'S so much good stuff you're just not keeping up. Because just recently I got back into rap after having not like I like rap music, but I just listen to the same stuff over and over and I don't really listen to new stuff. But just recently, like dove down the rabbit hole, went to world star hip hop's Facebook page and just started watching videos and discovered all these new rappers that I think are really cool and interesting. And I'm going to show you some stuff because I think actually there are a couple rappers right now doing weird stuff that you would like because you say it all sounds the same, but it's like, I think that music that is being pushed and popularized and passed around all sounds similar to itself because that's what's popular right now.
Speaker D: Sure.
Speaker C: But there's people out there doing cool stuff that's just not getting the spotlight focused on it. Someone on here suggested, check out childish Gambino.
Speaker B: Man.
Speaker C: It's fucking good.
Speaker D: Good shit, America. Did you see? Because this is the Internet. I just wanted to say someone on this podcast before suggested Brock Hampton. And I loved that. I actually did check that out on Apple Music and I really liked it. So I shouldn't say it's all Brock.
Speaker A: Hampton has this like punk energy because here it comes. No blank when you see, don't worry. But they have this punk energy because it's like twelve dudes in a giant house just making art.
Speaker D: Like they all make their videos and stuff.
Speaker A: So it has a very diy ethic and they don't give a fuck about labels or anything like that. They're just kind of making stuff. So I think that's why it has a raw energy as opposed to, like, super overproduced.
Speaker D: Yeah, I really liked it. And I think Kendrick Lamar is really talented. But even then album, after a while, I'm like, okay, I've had enough. I don't know. But yeah, give me some suggestions. Anybody out there has some.
Speaker C: Give Rocco some suggestions next week. By next week, Rocco is going to be looking like 69. That is something to look at.
Speaker A: Someone remade. This is America in Fortnite.
Speaker B: So if you want to see awesome.
Speaker D: That'S going to be cool. How they kind of recreate that shooting and stuff, I think that's just going to be a treat. That was kind of what Fortnite was made for.
Speaker C: You don't like Chief Keef?
Speaker D: I got nothing about chief. Didn't somebody shoot at Chief Keef this week?
Speaker B: He got shot.
Speaker D: He got shot at.
Speaker B: He didn't get shot. I'd rather get shot at than shot personally. Yeah, because one, you get one, you get both shot at and shot.
Speaker D: I would rather the bullets not hit me than hit me. Yep, bullets dance, but I'm weird. I'm like the weird know. I do the weird handshake. I dodge the bullets. I'm weird.
Speaker A: Just like Neo.
Speaker D: Yeah, just like Neo. Neo. They deleted scene where he shakes Smith's hand and that's how he absorbs him. He just does this little pinch and he. Hmm. I've got you now, Smith. Mr. Smith.
Speaker C: You know, it'll be a sad day when Rocco stops doing matrix references. And I hope that day. Hope that day never comes.
Speaker D: It will be an extra sad day because that will be the day I am dead.
Speaker C: We're going on nearly 20 years since that fucking movie came out. You're still quoting it.
Speaker D: Guess what?
Speaker A: Even the set is lit in green tone.
Speaker D: It is, because guess what? Watched it three days ago. It's out. Brushed up 4K, HDR. The best the movie has ever looked.
Speaker C: I still have my dvd.
Speaker D: I watched it.
Speaker C: I still got my vhs. Still good.
Speaker D: Well, you know what? You guys are still plugged in. I took the.
Speaker C: Yeah, my dad bought your wifi dvd.
Speaker B: Before we had dvd player. Just because he's like, one day I'm going to want to watch this on DVD.
Speaker D: Really?
Speaker B: Did he do that? He did.
Speaker D: It is crazy. Actually. This is a good question.
Speaker C: The matrix.
Speaker D: The Matrix.
Speaker C: No, I'm excited. Finally.
Speaker D: This is a good question. The Matrix DVD definitely was a game changer that I feel like made people turn their head to DVD. Like, oh, DVD is like the thing to get right. That was definitely the first mind blower DVD. But I would argue, and this is another movie I watched the other day that I watched it, and I realized, I think this was the movie that actually sold the DVD. Like, when this movie came out, my mom and dad bought DVD players. My uncle bought DVD player. It wasn't just the nerds. And that movie is gladiator. I feel like when that movie came out, I don't know if you guys had that experience. I feel like there was the Christmas that that movie came out on DVD. It was like, everyone I know got it. That was just like, well, yeah, Gladiator, it's going to look amazing. You know what I mean? That was kind of like. And that movie, too. I think a lot of people forget. The effects in that movie were kind of groundbreaking. You always hear about, oh, Jurassic park changed CGI, and it did for creature effects and things like that that are more in your face. But Gladiator did some shit. Gladiator was one of the first movies I knew of that altered locations. Like, looking like, okay, they filmed at the Coliseum, but they actually, with CG filled in this part of the Coliseum with people, and it was like, whoa. So there aren't just CG things in front of your face. They're doing little things in the background. You don't even notice. And on top of that, there's a guy that died in the production of that movie.
Speaker B: Wow.
Speaker D: And they finished his scenes with a computer effect, and it's still like, you got to be looking for it to know where it is now. Granted, looking at it now, I see the effect they're doing, and it's kind of his head on something else. I know where it is. So I see it and I go, this is why they got cocky in the Sopranos. They thought they could do this. Well, same kind of.
Speaker C: My favorite part of Gladiator is the guy walking around in denim jeans.
Speaker B: Yeah.
Speaker C: There's a scene where it's so funny, a crew member walks on camera. This is in the final cut, and he catches what he's doing and then slowly backs away. But he's standing behind a horse. So the horse's head blocks the upper half of his body. You just see legs and some hands, and it's like this. Go to the white shot. Imagine I have blue jeans on and Russell Crowe is holding a horse behind the horse.
Speaker B: Ha.
Speaker C: That scene is in the movie was my favorite scene as a kid.
Speaker D: That's awesome.
Speaker C: I love that shit.
Speaker D: Yeah, I rewatched that, too. That also is out in like four k. Now it looks amazing. And it was great. That's a good movie. That's a good movie. But again, I think as a testament to. You can do a lot of CG if you use it, right? If you're using it to replace every single fucking thing you're doing, it's like, all right, fuck CG. But that movie utilizes it in all these subtle ways that it makes it a grandiose movie. And even today, you watch it, you're not going, oh, all this cg. You don't. You don't even think about it. And that's how it should be, I think. But you decide, are you a gladiator man? Are you a jar jar man? What kind of CG do you like?
Speaker C: Somebody in chat said the guy who died on Gladiator was Oliver Reed and his picture on Wikipedia looks exactly like.
Speaker D: Whoa, whoa. Wow.
Speaker B: It's Derek.
Speaker C: That's me, ladies and gentlemen.
Speaker D: Oh, my gosh.
Speaker C: I am Oliver Reed.
Speaker D: Who's who?
Speaker C: You're dead. Don't get a close up on that.
Speaker D: Saved you some work. Wow. Who's dead and who's alive? We may never know.
Speaker B: We'll never know.
Speaker C: I'm in Gladiator. I'm going to start telling people I'm in gladiator.
Speaker B: Yeah, well, anyways, Sean, you started God of war. I did.
Speaker D: Hey, hold on. Let's hit our sponsor. We'll talk God of war. Can we do that?
Speaker B: Yeah.
Speaker C: Sean was trying to end the podcast.
Speaker B: I could tell, but I wasn't by the rock question and then talk for 15 minutes and answer the fucking great question he asked.
Speaker D: What, with the dvd thing?
Speaker B: Yeah, but it doesn't matter. Let's go to sponsors.
Speaker C: What's your favorite dvd?
Speaker B: I'm saying no one I know owned the Gladiator. No one cared about that.
Speaker D: Really?
Speaker B: No one cared?
Speaker C: I loved Gladiator.
Speaker D: Hey, Russell Crowe. Bias.
Speaker B: Now, here's the thing.
Speaker C: I love Gladiator. I used to like that movie, and.
Speaker B: I hate Russell Crowe. Why?
Speaker C: What happened?
Speaker D: What happened?
Speaker C: Did Russell Crowe do something to you?
Speaker D: What are we seeing right now?
Speaker C: What happened?
Speaker D: We did a breakthrough.
Speaker C: Hold on.
Speaker B: I used to like Gladiator. Russell Crowe.
Speaker C: Did you meet Russell Crowe?
Speaker B: No.
Speaker C: Okay.
Speaker B: Thank fucking God.
Speaker C: Jesus.
Speaker B: I never wanted to be alive. This is so dumb. It's so stupid. Okay, but Rocco and Kevin play this fucking video all the time of Russell Crowe singing beautiful girl or whatever the fuck that song is called as some interview they did for Robin Hood.
Speaker D: They only want to do your dirt. They'll have you suicidal suicidal when they say it's over and it's like they.
Speaker C: All in the middle interview suicidal by Sean Kingston. Yes.
Speaker B: So they stop the interview and start singing.
Speaker C: And it's so awkward and shitty and.
Speaker B: I cannot take it. And every time I see Leslie Crowe, I feel uncomfortable because I think about that video. He looks like such a fucking loser.
Speaker C: A lamo where you're fussing and you're fighting.
Speaker B: I hate that video. And that video I hate so much. I now hate Russell Crowe.
Speaker C: Do you know how much cringy shit you've done on camera?
Speaker B: Yeah. Russell Crowe hates you.
Speaker C: You're going to hold Russell Crowe. You're going to hold one song against Russell.
Speaker B: No.
Speaker C: Academy Award winning actor Crow.
Speaker B: This is the thing. I have done several things.
Speaker C: You don't even have an Oscar yet.
Speaker B: Yet, but several things that are very embarrassing. They then showed me another interview where they did it again. They sang the song again.
Speaker D: The whole press, they're the merry men.
Speaker C: Sean, there's like ten videos of you dressed up like link from Zelda.
Speaker B: Yeah, that's my job. Okay, but what if it was one director? Your job is to do an interview for the movie, promote it. Fine. Don't fucking sing like that. Russell Crowe.
Speaker D: Well, okay, so I will be honest. I've never seen Sean react more to a video than when I would play that song at our. I don't know why we can't stay together. Old, old office. Sean would just erupt. So we kept doing, I mean, it was like, okay, you are having a shit fit on this one video that I'm playing to myself. So now I'm sending it to you.
Speaker B: Right?
Speaker D: So, yeah, I can understand that.
Speaker C: What's funny to me is Russell Crowe made gladiator, like, over a decade before that song even came out.
Speaker B: Sure.
Speaker C: So the idea that he did something in the future that retroactively ruined that movie for you is pretty funny and, like, dangerous to all actors out there.
Speaker B: Well, don't fuck up. Don't sing during your interview for your.
Speaker D: They're the merry men. That's what they do. They play the know, they stroll around.
Speaker B: Real fucking cute. Russell Crowe.
Speaker C: Hold on. Okay. Does it make any difference? Does it make it any better when you know the story behind why they do that? And I'll explain it to you.
Speaker B: Please.
Speaker C: They were all on set together and they needed to relax, and they all thought that song was funny. And so one person would sing it and then another person would join in and over time it turned into an inside joke. You should get his reaction, not me. Turned into an inside joke about, like, we sing this song and we're like a quartet that sings it. They were bringing this private inside joke from the set and sharing it with their audience to.
Speaker B: Should have left it. Leave it on the set. Wow. There's inside jokes that we have that we don't bring to the set and the podcast because it's for us. It's for us. We're friends. And you know what? I don't have any respect for Russell Crowe.
Speaker C: Holy shit.
Speaker B: For doing that.
Speaker C: He starred in a beautiful mind.
Speaker B: I think it sucks.
Speaker C: A beautiful mind.
Speaker B: I think you suck, and I think not you. I would never see the nice guys ever.
Speaker D: That was a great movie.
Speaker B: I will never see that movie because of what you did.
Speaker D: Russell Crowe, did you ever see real talk? Don't sugarcoat, don't dance around it. Did you see Cinderella man?
Speaker B: No, fuck you.
Speaker C: I didn't see that.
Speaker D: All right. Our sponsor today, yeah, I'm sorry we had to segue on that note, but that's a goddamn shame. Cinderella man is a beautiful film that got released twice because the title, there was a study on, like, the title made so many people not go see that movie.
Speaker B: Well, I thought it was a girls movie.
Speaker D: Yeah, Cinderella man, what is that? It's a great movie about a boxer, but it didn't hit like no men went to see it. It just. Cinderella man, this is way back then. So they rereleased it later and I don't think it did much better. But that actually is a good movie. I did like. Okay, anyway, Shop Mega 64 dot is the place to.
Speaker C: I just sent you something that's going to change your mind.
Speaker D: Okay. Shop Mega 64 dot is the place to go for all your Mega 64 merch needs. And again, if you're watching this on 64 day, there's a ton of exclusives that are up right now for one day.

Speaker B: I'm going to say it is Mega 64 day, and I was a little negative just now, and that was not what I intended. So I will say, in light of the holiday spirit that I have, I forgive you, Russell Crowe, for what you did to me. I sent him the game changer. I forgive.
Speaker C: His reaction, unfortunately, was off camera.
Speaker B: This is the picture that Derek sent me.
Speaker D: What?
Speaker B: That's him.
Speaker D: Fuck is.
Speaker B: That's Russell Crowe. Russell Crowe is looking. I think that's Russell. After hearing my rant, he feels bad and he aged 25 years.
Speaker D: He actually just did. He did an auction. He did a divorce auction.
Speaker B: A divorce auction.
Speaker D: He's getting in a divorce and is selling all his stuff for money. And he made kind of a joke out of it. But there was great stuff in that auction. It was like his gladiator armor and all this mastering commander shit. It was tight. He did not look good, though, in the.
Speaker B: Well, I forgive you. As I said.
Speaker D: We'Re good.
Speaker C: All right, thank you.
Speaker D: You saw it here first. The impossible happened on Mega 64 day. Russell Crowe and Sean Chatfield have mended their ways.
Speaker B: This has been an emotional roller coaster for all of us, I think.
Speaker D: But mostly Russell Crowe. Mostly Russell Crowe. He can be in movies again, which is great. I got to say, I was really excited because they cast him as Dr. Jekyll in the Dark universe.
Speaker B: The dark universe.
Speaker D: And I'm not going to spoil what happens with Dr. Jekyll, but you were going to see something else, too.
Speaker C: Who?
Speaker D: He might have a darker half. Let's just leave it at that.
Speaker B: Okay, don't tell me.
Speaker D: Let's not say.
Speaker C: The most disappointing thing about that whole fiasco.
Speaker D: The dark universe.
Speaker C: No, Dr. Jekyll. Okay, for those of you who don't know, Russell Crowe is cast as Dr. Jekyll and was pretending like the whole world didn't fucking expect Mr. Hyde to show up.
Speaker D: I mean, universal was acting like you're not going to. Well, yeah, not gonna say anything.
Speaker C: And just the fact that universal banked on a whole generation of filmgoers not being familiar with Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde. Like, who's running the ship over there? Like, hey, there's this millionaire named Bruce Wayne, but he's got a dark secret.
Speaker D: Warner Brothers isn't talking about what Bruce Wayne is.
Speaker C: We're not gonna talk. This millionaire all must say is he's not just a playboy. There's more to him.
Speaker D: Darker side coming the summer.
Speaker B: Yeah.
Speaker C: It's like, give me a fucking break. Give us some credit. We've been around the block a few times.
Speaker B: Has there been an update to the dark universe? Is that all cancelled?
Speaker D: I think it's over. It sounds like it's done. And I've heard. One of the things that I've heard from people on the inside is Russell Crowe, Russell himself. Is they built or. They have a whole headquarters for just dark universe projects on the universal lot in LA. And I know people who work in LA that say that building, it's full of. They actually dug up. Not literally dug up, but all the.
Speaker C: Old monster movies from.
Speaker D: All the old monster movies. Stuff from the mummy stuff. In these cases, it's an incredible building and it sits empty. Yeah, they said that is like, over. Isn't that crazy?
Speaker B: I just think of that photo of like, Johnny Depp and Russell Crowe and Tom Cruise and the girl who was the mummy. I remember her name. And it's like they fucked the balls on you to take that picture and put it out there in the world.
Speaker C: You know what? They actually. I'm going to give them some credit. I'm going to throw them a bone. The Marvel. Not the Marvel, the universal movie properties. You have something there. All of those movies have a thread that connects them all. But the thread is such a tiny thread. They should have just let it exist. Basically, what I'm saying is Frankenstein, Wolf Man, Dracula, the creature from the Black Lagoon, they're all black and white horror movies from a long time ago. That's the only thing that connects them. You want to reboot that and make it a new property, cool. But they should have just done a Dracula movie, a Frankenstein movie, a mummy movie.
Speaker D: Totally.
Speaker C: Why put all the same actors in every movie and having them crossing over.
Speaker D: They'Re part of like a league.
Speaker C: Yeah, that's so stupid.
Speaker B: Wanted the new avengers, and that is.
Speaker C: So stupid, because here's what happened. The first one failed and now all the other ones have failed too. If you would just have them be individual things that existed at the same time, maybe even with some light references to one another, you could have, like, even if one tanks, you could salvage the rest.
Speaker A: The final nail in the coffin for the dark universe stuff was Guillermo del Toro. Pitched the shape of water to universal as a creature from the black Regloon reboot.
Speaker C: Oh, really?
Speaker D: Wow.
Speaker A: So he took it to Fox Searchlight and that one bed picture made a ton of money. Now Yaml del Turo has his own production company deal with Fox Searchlight to produce any horror movie he wants to. Meanwhile, Universal has an empty lot.
Speaker D: Yeah, cool. I was just going to say, here's what would have worked. I'll tell you this, and everyone who hears this, you're going to know I'm right when you hear this. Universal, take note. This is what would have worked.
Speaker B: Okay.
Speaker D: What is the most exciting stuff in horror and stuff like that right now? It's these small movies, right? Not even necessarily that they're horror, but like movies like split. I don't know if that's a horror movie.
Speaker B: It's just this Benzville movie, you know what I mean?
Speaker D: It's still like bizarre phenomenon kind of thing. But it's a small movie and it's awesome. Even get out is a weird, is like a Twilight Zone episode. It's a weird little movie. If Universal, Universal to me thought in the wrong direction, they thought everything has to be a big blockbuster, like Jurassic World. And I think they should have thought the other way. If Universal just put out this small budget movie with a couple good stars in it, and it was Dracula, just this little movie, have a new director do it, you know what I mean? And then do a movie. Hey, Frankenstein is coming out and it's by this new director. Everyone says he's really good. If they had kept them to little movies, you know what I mean? That would be exciting, dude. The new Dracula movie is. Know, if they kept it to that and had these little movies with more creativity than cgi, blockbuster, I think they would have had a gold mine on their think, think on the scale of the old ones.
Speaker C: Well, the thing is, I don't think horror is good for big budget studios. Yeah, horror is successful, but you can't make a big budget horror movie because then it turns into an action adventure fantasy.
Speaker D: Yeah, it can't help us.
Speaker C: You can only spend so much money before shit stops getting scary. And now there's a chase scene and now we're fighting it and all this stuff.
Speaker D: What's scary is intimacy almost. You know what I mean? Like in closed quarters.
Speaker B: Yeah.
Speaker C: Like all the big horror movies from the last decade are small kind of quiet movies. The mummy, the universal mummy was an action movie with Tom Cruise. The fucking trailer starts with a plane going down.
Speaker D: Absolutely.
Speaker C: That's not a horror movie, that's an action movie.
Speaker B: People need to realize and I think these people are still in power and they haven't retired or died off yet. But seeing a plane crash or something like that is not, like, going to get me in the seat anymore. Like, oh, this building blows up.
Speaker C: Yeah, I'm there.
Speaker B: That building is going to fall down. Everything is this. That doesn't sell me on shit.
Speaker D: Yeah. So anyway, in terms of just their monsters, and I'm not even saying they had to make the only $100,000 budget or anything, they could still be smaller movies.
Speaker C: These days.
Speaker D: In Hollywood, a $20 million movie is nothing. I think they should have started there, though. Still, just keep it to this kind of creepy little movies would have just, I think, gone a long way and given longevity to those brands, kids today say, dude, the new Dracula is creepy as hell. You need to see this instead of a fucking monster patrol. I don't know.
Speaker B: I'm going to switch topics really quick and talk about something that is not even in your wheelhouse at all. I got a video game, and I've been playing the shit out of this video game, which is rare for me. I played out of war. MLB, the show.
Speaker C: I knew it was going to be a sports game.
Speaker B: Whoa. 2018. It's blowing my mind. I know I'm talking to, like, three people who are watching this right now, but let me tell you that this has something that I feel like every video game should have, which is it updates almost daily, but it's, like, kind of seamless. And it is beautiful in the sense of, I want to play as the padres. Okay. It's the current day lineup that I'm.
Speaker D: Playing, like, to the day, to the.
Speaker B: Day with their stats added then and then. The commentators are like, matt Vaskergens, who is a real commentator, but the things he says is like, oh, here's Travis Johnkowski. He's been a little cold lately. He's only had four in the last 15 of bats. Like, whoa, whoa. That's awesome. It's fucking amazing. It's incredible. So the way that they are able just to make it, it looks fucking real. We did it.
Speaker C: Well, on that note, I got a game I've been playing, too. It's board game. Pencil and paper, actually. Tic tac toe.
Speaker D: Hell, yeah.
Speaker C: You got to try this game out. Every game is like a battle. It's like chess, but faster, smarter, smarter. And you could play it with grandmas, you could play it with babies. It's for everybody. And it's free to play with no DLC.
Speaker B: I don't understand what you're doing right now. I don't understand what you're saying in the bit, but I will say that in light of mangs to four day, I'm going to think that you're being positive towards me and you're not talking shit on this sick ass game that I'm playing.
Speaker C: Not everything is about you, Sean. I'm just talking about a great new game I discovered called Tictactoe Derek.
Speaker D: It's Mega 64 day. Derek's referencing our a three video because Tictactoe again, definitely.
Speaker B: I'm not smart enough to figure out what the fuck you're doing, but I'm just going to assume it's nice.
Speaker D: Well, you're not smart enough for tic tac toe then either, because that's a thinking man's game. Kind of like 40 swamp dog in.
Speaker C: The chesses in all caps. I'm playing Derek's game. Sean's game sucks.
Speaker D: There you have it. I mean, the proof is in the swamp dog.
Speaker B: We can't all play the same games. I can't play yakuza.
Speaker A: There is a game everyone is playing though. God of war.
Speaker B: Can you talk about can? Well, here's the thing, Frank.
Speaker C: I don't think we have time.
Speaker B: Well, we do have some time to talk about, but I will say that. Check out my stream if you want. I'm playing on easy. Direction is playing harder. It's very easy. Play on easy. I can't believe that. There's no stopping point. There's no loading screen. Yeah, there's no cuts. It's seamless. It's amazing. How did they fucking nail that? Yeah, it's beautiful. It's a great game so far.
Speaker D: I want to give a shout out to something that came out this week because I know somebody who worked on it. And I didn't realize this, but there was a street Fighter collection, man, I can't remember the official name of the collection. Street Fighter anniversary, 30th Anniversary collection. Okay. Well, it came out on all systems, including Switch, so I got it on Switch because already I was stoked. The game is 39, 99 and it has a billion Street Fighter games on it. Every version of Street Fighter, Street Fighter two, Street Fighter three, every version that existed of all those is on there. Street Fighter Alpha one, two and three, and perfect versions of all of them. But I got it on Switch just because I wanted to be able to take it around. That's why I did it. Anyway, what is worth the price of admission alone is the art gallery in that game. You can play the games like you want to play offline, play online play or history? And you go into history and it is galleries upon galleries of all concept art and behind the scenes stuff on every Street Fighter game ever made. And it is so well done. And I didn't know a guy named Frank. I never know how to pronounce his last name. Sefaldi. I think it's Sefaldi. Not this Frank, but a different Frank was one of the lead contributors on this. He worked on a mega man collection too, and he did a great job with that too. But the artwork is all in there and just there's so much to flip through and he does his homework. It's like, hey, here's a screenshot of Street Fighter one on NES which has never existed. And this is our only proof it was ever made. So where does this, like, it even says that in there? Like we couldn't even find it within know. And all this art that's in there. And you look at some of the paintings and stuff, you can zoom in on them so far. You see the brushstrokes, which made me laugh, I guess. Frank said on Twitter that if you download the game, there's a huge download file size. And they said like a fifth of that are the games. And the rest, gigs and gigs are the artwork because they're lossless.
Speaker C: So don't download the game.
Speaker D: Get a cartridge, buy it, then you'll have it. But anyway, it's just gigs and gigs of uncompressed, lossless artwork. Incredible. It was worth the price of admission. Just for that.
Speaker A: I was going to say the thing that I've been loving Street Fighter two is one of my favorite games of all time. I'm excellent at it. There's a ton of people who haven't played Street Fighter two in a long time. Jumping back in this collection, and I'm just going online and destroying people like I'm a bully.
Speaker B: Hell yeah.
Speaker A: Fucking great. Same thing with third stripe. I'm having a great time. A month from now, it's only going to be the hardcore nerds still playing. So then it'll be more even. But right now, don't even try playing online because they'll destroy twice.
Speaker C: Don't even try it because Frank's in.
Speaker B: There and he'll get you anyway.
Speaker D: So that was really cool.
Speaker C: Okay, I'm ready to switch gears into watching video mode.
Speaker D: Yeah, sure.
Speaker C: I know we got to get this before.
Speaker B: Yeah, you do. I wanted to say Frank has a show that he's been doing for us every Friday, and I wanted to promote.
Speaker C: That, check him out on Friday at.
Speaker B: 02:00 p.m. Pacific time. About 02:00 p.m.? Right? Yeah.
Speaker A: So the premise of the show is it's called last game standing. I'm starting to stream games now through the making 64 twitch. Every week I'm bringing two to four games. The mix is kind of like an old game, an old favorite, some new games. A lot of like Steam indies where these games don't have the budget to market it. And I love playing really deep of tier games and then kind of new games. And at the end of the stream, it's about 2 hours. The audience gets to vote on which game returns next week. So I've been playing Tony Ox underground, South Park 64, lots of classics, but real fast I want to plug two games. Moonlighter is a new action rpg on PC PS four, and it's coming to switch. It's an action rpg where you go through dungeons and you collect loot. And then the second half of the game is you're selling items in a shop. It's super, super addicting. It's kind of like rogue Legacy meets Animal Crossing. That game is awesome. And then there's another game called Slipstream that is basically outrun and ridracer, a really like lo fi, pixel perfect early 3d game. It's $10 on Steam. It's gorgeous.
Speaker B: Yeah, that game was cool.
Speaker A: Yeah, I'm showing off cool games every week. Fridays, 02:00 p.m. Love special guests. But yeah, it's dope. And they're all on the Megas four archive channel.
Speaker B: Hell yeah. Can I recommend you play Street Fighter and I could see you kill people? I'll do it. Yeah, I'll bring in the picture maybe.
Speaker D: Yeah, that'd be cool.
Speaker B: Okay, cool.
Speaker D: All right, well, we're going to end the podcast here for this week. If you're watching us live, stay tuned because we're going to do some more stuff. But I was asking people on our stream last night, it is 64 day. Every person that called in, I told them this is our day. So we're self obsessed. What is the best Mega 64 video of all time? We should end that on you say yours.
Speaker B: Oh fuck.
Speaker D: Favorite Mega 64 video of all time. Looking back 15 years, favorite thing.
Speaker B: Oh God, I don't know so much. Can you go to Derek? I'll think about this.
Speaker D: Derek.
Speaker B: What do you go to? Meg or Derek.
Speaker C: Kuduragi's way?
Speaker B: Wow, that's a good one.
Speaker D: Kudaragi's way.
Speaker B: That might be up there for me, I'm going to say, for me, and this isn't like the. It was just like the biggest milestone for us, I thought, was the Mario video with Miyamoto in it. That, to me, was like, we are legit and we're doing this and this is our path. And that kind of is like, when I realized this is going to work out for us.
Speaker D: So that video, I'm going to say either, man, it's tough. I'm going to say either Kudoragi's way or paperboy or Deus X tribute. Wow, that one's great.
Speaker B: Wow.
Speaker D: One of those.
Speaker B: And Meg.
Speaker C: Meg.
Speaker B: All right, the final one.
Speaker D: Favorite vid. Meg, what's your favorite vid of ours?
Speaker B: Favorite vid.
Speaker D: What's your favorite short film we've done?
Speaker B: Stanley parable.
Speaker C: Wow, Stanley Parable.
Speaker B: Going a little. I wasn't ready for that. I wasn't ready to hear that.
Speaker C: Deep cut.
Speaker B: Deep cut.
Speaker D: Well, there you go, everybody. You got to see us pat ourselves on the back.
Speaker A: I said this last night, but Timbo.
Speaker B: Timbo. That's the Kevin. What'd you say?
