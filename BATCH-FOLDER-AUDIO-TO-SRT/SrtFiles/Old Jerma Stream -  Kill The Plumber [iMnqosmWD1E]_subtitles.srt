1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
Who cares?

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:04,000
You know what I mean?

3
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:06,000
Gipsy shit.

4
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:12,000
I was working on a video.

5
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:14,000
I wanted to take a quick little break.

6
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:16,000
Maybe stream for an hour or two.

7
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:18,000
Go back to it.

8
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,000
So what is going to play?

9
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:40,000
So this game is a little different.

10
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:46,000
You are the bad guy in this game.

11
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:52,000
You have to kill the not Super Mario as a gumball.

12
00:00:52,000 --> 00:01:00,000
I have a certain amount of time.

13
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:04,000
Sometimes you just have to say who cares turn on the stream.

14
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:06,000
I just screwed it up.

15
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:08,000
I have to restart.

16
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:10,000
What is the quick restart?

17
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:12,000
Right bumper?

18
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:16,000
That is good enough.

19
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:20,000
It is a neat little game.

20
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:24,000
It gets much harder.

21
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:30,000
This is just the first little area.

22
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:32,000
It is cold.

23
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:34,000
It is really cold.

24
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:38,000
It is extremely cold.

25
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:44,000
What?

26
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:48,000
It is going to get really cold tonight too.

27
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:52,000
I think it is going to be like 10 degrees or something around here.

28
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:58,000
Later on.

29
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:02,000
Oh, he got it.

30
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:08,000
How do I get three stars here?

31
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:12,000
I feel like that is going to be hard to do.

32
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:16,000
Because I have to, if you are wondering what is going on on the bottom of the screen here,

33
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:20,000
I have to start an amount of time to get three stars.

34
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:28,000
How am I supposed to get him to die before the first star is taken away?

35
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:34,000
I am not going for perfect, but going for completion.

36
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:38,000
I am going to make him jump this way.

37
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:44,000
I can do that over here.

38
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:48,000
Yes, you are playing as the goombas.

39
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:54,000
You play as the bad guys in this game.

40
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:58,000
Fuck.

41
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:02,000
How am I supposed to get up there?

42
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:04,000
I can't jump right now.

43
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:08,000
Is there something I am missing?

44
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:12,000
That is one star.

45
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:20,000
Don't ask me.

46
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:24,000
Damn it.

47
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:28,000
This game makes me mess myself.

48
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:34,000
I just didn't even mean to do that, but I got two stars.

49
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:40,000
I got three stars.

50
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:46,000
I am going to kill the plumber.

51
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:50,000
I am going to kill the plumber.

52
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:54,000
Free to play.

53
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:58,000
Is it really?

54
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:04,000
I got it on steam.

55
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:14,000
One star is better than three stars.

56
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:18,000
I screwed it up already.

57
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:26,000
I can definitely get him here.

58
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:32,000
Oh, come on.

59
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:38,000
I know I can get him here.

60
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:42,000
I am positive.

61
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:44,000
I am 100% positive.

62
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:48,000
He is not jumping on my head either.

63
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:52,000
I am going to call shenanigans.

64
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:56,000
I am going to get this.

65
00:04:56,000 --> 00:05:00,000
This does remind me of an old mini clip game.

66
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:10,000
Last time I was able to watch a stream, I was off sick from work.

67
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:14,000
I just know.

68
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:18,000
You are going to be quick in this game.

69
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:22,000
If he gets to that pole, it is over.

70
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:28,000
Damn it.

71
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:34,000
There we go.

72
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:40,000
Seems like it is a lot like super house of dead ninjas where the steam version has some extra levels.

73
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:44,000
I saw, hey, this is cool.

74
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:48,000
I have to be the stop guy.

75
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:52,000
See, that first little area was this.

76
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:58,000
Come on, walk through.

77
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:00,000
Gotcha.

78
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:06,000
You can't get away from the stop.

79
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:10,000
I am already beaten this one.

80
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:14,000
I have to be way faster than that.

81
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:16,000
No, there is no snow at here yet.

82
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:20,000
I am still snowless at the moment.

83
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:26,000
That wasn't right.

84
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:30,000
Still three stars.

85
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:36,000
Well, Inky, I hope you had a good new year as well in holiday.

86
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:40,000
I can turn to a hammer brother now.

87
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:44,000
Let's redo this one.

88
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:48,000
Very slow.

89
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:54,000
He is standing completely still.

90
00:06:54,000 --> 00:07:00,000
I am just trying to get like the three stars.

91
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:04,000
I have to suck it up.

92
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:08,000
I have something cool for Christmas.

93
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:12,000
I have a safety razor for Christmas.

94
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:20,000
I have a cold fashion, your grandfather 1930s shave razor.

95
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:24,000
I think it is wonderful.

96
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:28,000
I am going to do this shoe at three.

97
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:32,000
Let's see, one, two, three.

98
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:36,000
And then he is a movie.

99
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:40,000
I just have to jump over these and throw that.

100
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:44,000
I am going to throw it again.

101
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:48,000
That will let him go over.

102
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:52,000
Right at the bush.

103
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:04,000
Swinny Todd.

104
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:08,000
There we go.

105
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:12,000
Red Ranger just subscribed to the channel.

106
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:16,000
Welcome.

107
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:22,000
I didn't realize that one was going there.

108
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:26,000
I just put that one in.

109
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:32,000
My first and only emote ever.

110
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:36,000
It is currently processing through Twitch right now.

111
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:46,000
It is fucking terrible.

112
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:50,000
I am not paying attention.

113
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:54,000
Big one little one.

114
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:56,000
I got him.

115
00:08:56,000 --> 00:09:00,000
The moment of the coaster.

116
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:02,000
First beta explode.

117
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:04,000
I like this one.

118
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:06,000
Can I jump too?

119
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:08,000
Hey, whoa, whoa, he shoots.

120
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:10,000
What?

121
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:12,000
How am I supposed to get him?

122
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:16,000
I can go underneath it.

123
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:18,000
I am going to hold left.

124
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:20,000
Three stars, right?

125
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:28,000
Yeah.

126
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:32,000
I will tell you, I will be honest with you.

127
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:36,000
I don't know what my emotes are going to be.

128
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:40,000
I have no idea.

129
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:44,000
This emote is just such an awful, it is just the fucking moon.

130
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:48,000
You will see it a little bit.

131
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:50,000
The timer doesn't start to move.

132
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:52,000
I get it.

133
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:54,000
Look at this guy in the chat.

134
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:56,000
Ghostly hell.

135
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:58,000
You are correct.

136
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:02,000
Now I am controlling two people at the same time.

137
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:04,000
This is going to be odd for me.

138
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:06,000
I don't know if he can kill that one.

139
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:08,000
Can I jump out of this?

140
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:12,000
I don't think I can even jump out of this.

141
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:16,000
I knocked him up.

142
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:24,000
I just can't wait till you guys.

143
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:26,000
Whoever is subscribed to this channel.

144
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:34,000
When stars streaming, you can spam the fuck out of his chat with the German moon emote.

145
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:38,000
That is all I care about.

146
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:42,000
This is just like a big boo.

147
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:44,000
I get it.

148
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:46,000
What just killed him?

149
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:56,000
He just jumped me.

150
00:10:56,000 --> 00:11:00,000
I thought he couldn't see me.

151
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:08,000
This is not sponsored.

152
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:14,000
Can I jump through here?

153
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:16,000
I think I can.

154
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:20,000
Can I close that off?

155
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:22,000
Kind of confused here.

156
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:26,000
This is definitely where I can get him to go through that hole.

157
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:30,000
Wait, wait, wait, hold on.

158
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:32,000
Let's think about this for a second.

159
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:34,000
When that's closed, he's looking over here.

160
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:38,000
Open it so I can go down.

161
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:40,000
No!

162
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:44,000
I'm just going to have to catch him over here when he comes down here.

163
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:48,000
Yeah.

164
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:50,000
How long till we get moon butt?

165
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:54,000
The moon butt.

166
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:58,000
Tremor, why didn't you show up at our wedding?

167
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:00,000
I don't know, man.

168
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:06,000
Make him collect all the green coins to disable his powers.

169
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:10,000
How the hell am I going to get him to do that?

170
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:12,000
He's going to kill me right here.

171
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:18,000
Will he just want, and he's going to walk into all of them except for...

172
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:22,000
He's showing me this is a new mechanic in the game.

173
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:24,000
He's going to get them all.

174
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:26,000
I didn't even have to do anything.

175
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:30,000
I think they're just teaching me this.

176
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:34,000
Huh?

177
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:36,000
Okay, okay. I still had to kill him.

178
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:40,000
I let him get all the coins that I didn't do anything about it.

179
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:42,000
See, oh, this is going to be...

180
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:46,000
Okay, I'm going to have to give him a second here, guys.

181
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:50,000
No.

182
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:56,000
You know, I think I can hide in here, right?

183
00:12:56,000 --> 00:13:00,000
Just wait till he's done and just follow him down.

184
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:02,000
Kind of.

185
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:04,000
Maybe?

186
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:06,000
No, I don't think so.

187
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:08,000
Yeah, actually, that was right.

188
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:10,000
Because I'm going to appear right here and he's going to walk right into me.

189
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:12,000
Fuck the other coin!

190
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:14,000
There we go.

191
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:18,000
I don't even care if I got no...

192
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:22,000
Only two stars on this one.

193
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:24,000
He tried to jump me.

194
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:26,000
I just barely beat that one.

195
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:32,000
Took me a really long time to realize that you're the ghost of nothing running, dude.

196
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:36,000
Yeah, I guess so.

197
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:38,000
Okay, so I got to...

198
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:40,000
Shit.

199
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:42,000
You jump and get those coins.

200
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:46,000
Kind of just have to get out of the way.

201
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:50,000
Get that last one.

202
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:52,000
Oh, you...oh, come on!

203
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:56,000
That was so not fair.

204
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:04,000
Grab that one.

205
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:08,000
Almost died.

206
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:16,000
Who's this?

207
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:22,000
I don't even know what happened.

208
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:24,000
I'm the cannon.

209
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:26,000
Okay, I was the cannon.

210
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:28,000
I thought I was the guy in the painting.

211
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:32,000
For a second, I thought I was going to shoot laser beams out of my eyes.

212
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:36,000
Alrighty.

213
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:40,000
I can do better than that.

214
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:44,000
I'm making fun of a lava.

215
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:46,000
Nope.

216
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:50,000
I will now.

217
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:52,000
Whoa!

218
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:54,000
I shouldn't have shot the second.

219
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:56,000
That was a stupid idea.

220
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:58,000
I shouldn't have shot the second time.

221
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:00,000
Please, please.

222
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:04,000
That doesn't sound sense.

223
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:10,000
There we go.

224
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:18,000
Thought I was the flag.

225
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:28,000
Oh, it gets real confusing when you have to control two different things at the same time.

226
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:32,000
I'm going to try to just air-shot them.

227
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:36,000
I'll be able to.

228
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:38,000
Forget about the ghost.

229
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:42,000
We're just going to go with a direct shot in the air.

230
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:44,000
I'll get him.

231
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:46,000
Don't worry, guys.

232
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:48,000
Just pop some popcorn or something.

233
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:50,000
He'll come back and he'll be gone.

234
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:52,000
That was total dog shit.

235
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:56,000
I hit him right in the face.

236
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:58,000
Ghosts just go down there.

237
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:02,000
Ghosts.

238
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:04,000
Yeah.

239
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:08,000
No, come.

240
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:14,000
I have to shoot him in the air.

241
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:24,000
Oh, I just figured it out accidentally.

242
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:26,000
He's at it again.

243
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:28,000
The green coins will make...

244
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:30,000
Alright, so shoot him.

245
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:32,000
Get a knock him up to the...

246
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:36,000
Oh.

247
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:38,000
Fuck.

248
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:42,000
Thank God they put that safety net right there.

249
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:46,000
I would never have done that.

250
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:48,000
I'll just shoot fireballs.

251
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:52,000
I'll smash to the ground while in the air.

252
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:00,000
Can I...

253
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:02,000
I could probably make that jump, huh?

254
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:04,000
Nope.

255
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:08,000
I knock him up in the air when I do that.

256
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:14,000
I got it.

257
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:16,000
Easy.

258
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:28,000
Why don't you walk forward?

259
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:32,000
There's no reason for him to walk forward.

260
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:36,000
Ooh, he's invincible.

261
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:40,000
Okay, I got him.

262
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:46,000
Hold on, hold on. I need a second to think about this.

263
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:52,000
Oh boy, hold on a minute.

264
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:54,000
I can't land on that.

265
00:17:54,000 --> 00:18:00,000
Shouldn't I be able to?

266
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:08,000
I guess I can move.

267
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:16,000
Shit.

268
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:18,000
Fucking all four of them.

269
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:20,000
All four of them?

270
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:22,000
Why did I say four of them?

271
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:28,000
There was like 10 of four of them.

272
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:32,000
I gotta make it over here.

273
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:36,000
Damn. Where are the coins?

274
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:40,000
He's invincible.

275
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:46,000
I gotta drop him.

276
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:50,000
I have to drop him.

277
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:56,000
Shit, I dropped myself.

278
00:18:56,000 --> 00:19:02,000
Do I have to...

279
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:10,000
Yeah, I gotta go all the way across.

280
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:14,000
This one's actually gonna be pretty tough.

281
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:20,000
I just need to get all the way around my fat fucking sloppy body.

282
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:26,000
See ya.

283
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:32,000
Hey, that was the first world I believe.

284
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:36,000
What?

285
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:40,000
Don't cry, Princess.

286
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:44,000
We have taken care of your stalker flummer.

287
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:54,000
You don't have to transfer to another castle anymore.

288
00:19:54,000 --> 00:20:00,000
We won.

289
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:06,000
Yay.

290
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:10,000
Onto the next world.

291
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:14,000
This is the sand level.

292
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:18,000
What is this?

293
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:22,000
You need 15 stars more.

294
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:28,000
I need more stars.

295
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:36,000
That's total stars, I guess.

296
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:40,000
Whatever, we're just gonna play the...

297
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:44,000
I can go back.

298
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:48,000
World, or...

299
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:52,000
He's heading for the princess to destroy him.

300
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:56,000
Look at that face, shit, my god.

301
00:20:56,000 --> 00:21:00,000
We got the princess.

302
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:04,000
Stop him.

303
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:08,000
I think I'm a bumpers head, I think.

304
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:16,000
Oh, come on, that is what you have to do.

305
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:20,000
You have to get him caught there and then...

306
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:24,000
You plumber.

307
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:28,000
Yeah.

308
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:32,000
No.

309
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:36,000
This one's tricky.

310
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:42,000
You gotta get him caught.

311
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:48,000
But he has such a huge frame hitbox.

312
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:50,000
I got him to... oh, I got a sub-emote coming in.

313
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:54,000
It just has to get approved.

314
00:21:54,000 --> 00:22:00,000
Huh?

315
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:08,000
Jump over him and then...

316
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:10,000
Oh, I got it, okay.

317
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:12,000
So he's gonna jump over this one.

318
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:16,000
And then I have to let him jump on this one up to hit that one.

319
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:24,000
Sort of.

320
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:28,000
Got to catch him right in the middle.

321
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:36,000
Not gonna fool me.

322
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:40,000
He's gonna get the coins.

323
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:44,000
Oh, wait just a second.

324
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:48,000
He jumps the first one.

325
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:56,000
I don't want him to win.

326
00:22:56,000 --> 00:23:04,000
Interesting.

327
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:12,000
Huh.

328
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:16,000
Yep, you gotta get him to drop down that way.

329
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:18,000
So he has to jump.

330
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:24,000
The first one and the second one right about here.

331
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:28,000
Almost got it.

332
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:32,000
There.

333
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:36,000
One, two, three, four.

334
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:40,000
Get the last one.

335
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:44,000
Oh, you prick.

336
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:50,000
They're getting a little harder here.

337
00:23:50,000 --> 00:24:00,000
Jump that one.

338
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:08,000
What did I do?

339
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:10,000
What did I do?

340
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:14,000
He has to jump this one.

341
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:18,000
Get that coin.

342
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:26,000
Now he has flight.

343
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:28,000
Well, that's not fair.

344
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:32,000
So I just gonna wait and just jump right in his face.

345
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:34,000
He just jumped over me.

346
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:38,000
No, I gotta get him up here.

347
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:48,000
There we go.

348
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:54,000
I didn't have any reactions either.

349
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:56,000
Just my luck.

350
00:24:56,000 --> 00:25:00,000
He's gonna get them all and then he's gonna fall and I'm gonna die.

351
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:02,000
So now he's gonna be running.

352
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:04,000
He's out of the flying.

353
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:06,000
The ears.

354
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:10,000
And then I just gotta be there right when he lands right here.

355
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:12,000
Nice pin point.

356
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:16,000
Hacking accuracy you have right there, by the way.

357
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:20,000
Shoot one down.

358
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:24,000
And then right there.

359
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:26,000
Chronic waffle.

360
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:28,000
Thank you for subscribing.

361
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:30,000
Welcome to the coaster.

362
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:32,000
You know the joke that we did before.

363
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:36,000
Boomerang.

364
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:38,000
And jump and use the boomerang.

365
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:40,000
Let me just hide.

366
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:42,000
I'm gonna play that again.

367
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:44,000
Thanks for subbing though.

368
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:46,000
Appreciate it.

369
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:48,000
Can have two out at one time.

370
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:54,000
Okay.

371
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:58,000
Can I get him too?

372
00:25:58,000 --> 00:26:06,000
The leaf freak out at that.

373
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:10,000
He's not going that far.

374
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:14,000
I think I'm missing something here.

375
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:18,000
Does he jump at all?

376
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:24,000
He doesn't have to.

377
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:30,000
Huh.

378
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:34,000
Oh the fuck is happening.

379
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:42,000
Oh.

380
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:46,000
Oh.

381
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:48,000
Okay.

382
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:52,000
All right.

383
00:26:52,000 --> 00:27:02,000
Get him right in his touchy.

384
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:12,000
Got ya.

385
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:16,000
Spams him until...

386
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:18,000
Okay.

387
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:22,000
I have to...

388
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:28,000
Just throw behind me in the dodge.

389
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:30,000
No, this is a sock.

390
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:32,000
I have thrown a sock as a weapon.

391
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:34,000
That's great.

392
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:40,000
What am I now?

393
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:44,000
What the hell is that?

394
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:48,000
Oh.

395
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:50,000
All right.

396
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:52,000
I turn into a shell.

397
00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:58,000
And I do the Cooper Trooper shell thing.

398
00:27:58,000 --> 00:28:00,000
No. Get up.

399
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:02,000
Get up.

400
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:06,000
Get up.

401
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:12,000
Fuck.

402
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:14,000
I think I feel like I have the right idea here.

403
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:18,000
But not the right execution.

404
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:20,000
Because he needs to hit himself into me.

405
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:28,000
I didn't work.

406
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:30,000
He died.

407
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:36,000
He fell down the hole.

408
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:38,000
Oh, Drexter.

409
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:40,000
Thanks for subscribing.

410
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:42,000
I was reading chat and I won.

411
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:44,000
Literally reading that somebody subscribed

412
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:46,000
and I beat the level.

413
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:48,000
I have no idea what happened.

414
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:52,000
Thanks for something, dude.

415
00:28:52,000 --> 00:28:56,000
Yes, there isn't an emote coming later today.

416
00:28:56,000 --> 00:29:02,000
I promise.

417
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:08,000
He can just fly, though.

418
00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:12,000
What the fuck is going on?

419
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:16,000
Do I have to just move this all the way down here?

420
00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:18,000
Because he can...

421
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:20,000
Hold on.

422
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:22,000
I need a second to think about this.

423
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:24,000
He can fly.

424
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:28,000
Do I have to bring this up?

425
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:32,000
Oh, would you look at that?

426
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:36,000
Would you look at that?

427
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:38,000
Are you serious?

428
00:29:38,000 --> 00:29:40,000
That's what I have to do.

429
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:42,000
Why is he hitting it?

430
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:44,000
What the fuck just happened?

431
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:46,000
I don't even know.

432
00:29:46,000 --> 00:29:50,000
I don't know.

433
00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:52,000
Somebody else subbed too.

434
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:54,000
Man.

435
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:56,000
Thanks for something, dude.

436
00:29:56,000 --> 00:30:00,000
I'm going to mess up your name.

437
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:02,000
A prey.

438
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:04,000
A Peru.

439
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:06,000
Thanks for subscribing.

440
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:08,000
I love you.

441
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:10,000
I don't know what to say.

442
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:16,000
I don't know what the fuck to say.

443
00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:18,000
Ah.

444
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:20,000
So that's another bright idea.

445
00:30:20,000 --> 00:30:22,000
I just have to knock him into the first one.

446
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:24,000
Maybe wait until he gets on this one.

447
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:26,000
Yep.

448
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:28,000
And then he...

449
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:30,000
Shit.

450
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:32,000
I have to go backwards, so that's for sure.

451
00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:34,000
The block on the left.

452
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:36,000
Oh my god, he's a moron.

453
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:38,000
Come on.

454
00:30:38,000 --> 00:30:40,000
You ready?

455
00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:42,000
Oh.

456
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:44,000
I feel like that was it.

457
00:30:44,000 --> 00:30:46,000
I feel like that was probably it.

458
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:48,000
Kind of.

459
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:50,000
Yeah, it was.

460
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:54,000
I just have to bounce him to this one.

461
00:30:54,000 --> 00:30:58,000
Come on.

462
00:30:58,000 --> 00:31:00,000
Come on.

463
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:02,000
Get it.

464
00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:06,000
Maybe not.

465
00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:08,000
There it is.

466
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:12,000
Now what do I do?

467
00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:18,000
Is it one of these times he's going to be an idiot?

468
00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:20,000
Or is this just done?

469
00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:22,000
Is this over?

470
00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:24,000
Yeah, this is over.

471
00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:26,000
Here comes the first one.

472
00:31:26,000 --> 00:31:30,000
All right, I'm going to sit right here.

473
00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:32,000
Let's damn it.

474
00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:34,000
Damn it.

475
00:31:34,000 --> 00:31:36,000
There it is.

476
00:31:36,000 --> 00:31:38,000
He didn't pick it.

477
00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:42,000
He didn't pick up the second coin.

478
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:44,000
He's got a lot of things to do.

479
00:31:44,000 --> 00:31:46,000
I'm going to sit right here.

480
00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:48,000
Let's damn it.

481
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:50,000
Damn it.

482
00:31:50,000 --> 00:31:52,000
There it is.

483
00:31:52,000 --> 00:31:54,000
He didn't pick it.

484
00:31:54,000 --> 00:31:56,000
He didn't pick up the second coin.

485
00:31:56,000 --> 00:31:58,000
He's got a lot of things to do.

486
00:31:58,000 --> 00:32:00,000
He didn't pick up the second coin.

487
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:02,000
He's got both.

488
00:32:02,000 --> 00:32:06,000
Oh, you disappointed me completely.

489
00:32:06,000 --> 00:32:08,000
Actually, that is what I have to do.

490
00:32:08,000 --> 00:32:10,000
Grab the first one.

491
00:32:10,000 --> 00:32:12,000
Grab the second one.

492
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:14,000
I'll get it.

493
00:32:14,000 --> 00:32:16,000
I don't even know.

494
00:32:16,000 --> 00:32:18,000
Fuck.

495
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:20,000
Why did I just hit restart?

496
00:32:20,000 --> 00:32:22,000
That was so dumb.

497
00:32:22,000 --> 00:32:24,000
I just had it right there.

498
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:26,000
I just had it.

499
00:32:26,000 --> 00:32:28,000
He has to jump over twice.

500
00:32:28,000 --> 00:32:32,000
Oh, this is going to drive me crazy.

501
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:36,000
Why is he not touching that coin?

502
00:32:36,000 --> 00:32:38,000
Get it.

503
00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:40,000
Just jump.

504
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:42,000
Just do the jump.

505
00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:44,000
Like you've been trained your whole life for.

506
00:32:44,000 --> 00:32:46,000
I'm going to jump over twice.

507
00:32:46,000 --> 00:32:48,000
I'm going to jump over twice.

508
00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:50,000
I'm going to jump over twice.

509
00:32:50,000 --> 00:32:52,000
I'm going to jump over twice.

510
00:32:52,000 --> 00:32:54,000
Why is he not touching that coin?

511
00:32:54,000 --> 00:32:56,000
My whole life for.

512
00:32:56,000 --> 00:32:58,000
Not Mario.

513
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:06,000
This music.

514
00:33:06,000 --> 00:33:08,000
I'm going to hear this music in my sleep.

515
00:33:16,000 --> 00:33:18,000
I got him.

516
00:33:20,000 --> 00:33:22,000
Three started.

517
00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:26,000
First beat of throw up to three spikers.

518
00:33:26,000 --> 00:33:28,000
Move sideways.

519
00:33:28,000 --> 00:33:30,000
It would be deep.

520
00:33:30,000 --> 00:33:32,000
Oh, you get to be the most his name.

521
00:33:32,000 --> 00:33:34,000
Look at the key to.

522
00:33:34,000 --> 00:33:36,000
Right.

523
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:40,000
And I'm right his head.

524
00:33:44,000 --> 00:33:46,000
I got him right in the crown of his head.

525
00:33:50,000 --> 00:33:52,000
Well, they can't die.

526
00:33:52,000 --> 00:33:53,000
Really.

527
00:33:54,000 --> 00:33:56,000
How can they walk in there?

528
00:33:56,000 --> 00:33:58,000
They don't die.

529
00:33:58,000 --> 00:34:00,000
Will he just walk?

530
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:02,000
Oh, I have to control him.

531
00:34:02,000 --> 00:34:04,000
Right.

532
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:06,000
I forgot.

533
00:34:06,000 --> 00:34:08,000
All right.

534
00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:10,000
This is what we're going to do.

535
00:34:10,000 --> 00:34:12,000
I put him here.

536
00:34:12,000 --> 00:34:14,000
You fucker.

537
00:34:14,000 --> 00:34:16,000
One here.

538
00:34:16,000 --> 00:34:18,000
Okay.

539
00:34:18,000 --> 00:34:20,000
Go for it, Mario.

540
00:34:20,000 --> 00:34:22,000
I don't know what to do.

541
00:34:22,000 --> 00:34:24,000
What do I do?

542
00:34:24,000 --> 00:34:26,000
I don't know.

543
00:34:26,000 --> 00:34:30,000
I think that's it.

544
00:34:30,000 --> 00:34:32,000
I'm pretty sure that's it.

545
00:34:32,000 --> 00:34:36,000
I'm just going to drop him onto him.

546
00:34:36,000 --> 00:34:39,000
It's the only thing I'm going to fix is the

547
00:34:39,000 --> 00:34:42,000
He's spinning.

548
00:34:42,000 --> 00:34:44,000
He's spinning.

549
00:34:44,000 --> 00:34:46,000
I know.

550
00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:48,000
I got him.

551
00:34:48,000 --> 00:34:55,000
I'm just going to try to do that another way.

552
00:34:55,000 --> 00:35:00,000
Almost 1 a.m. here in South Korea.

553
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:03,000
That's late. We are on opposite sides of the world.

554
00:35:03,000 --> 00:35:06,000
Have a good sleep.

555
00:35:06,000 --> 00:35:12,000
That's way too long for me to understand what was going on.

556
00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:17,000
No, you don't think I know what to do?

557
00:35:17,000 --> 00:35:22,000
You guys think I'm some kind of dummy, huh?

558
00:35:22,000 --> 00:35:27,000
Yeah, three stars.

559
00:35:27,000 --> 00:35:30,000
Okay.

560
00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:40,000
I thought I was going to get three stars, but turns out I'm only going to get one.

561
00:35:40,000 --> 00:35:47,000
Got you.

562
00:35:47,000 --> 00:35:55,000
And then when I'm just staying right here.

563
00:35:55,000 --> 00:36:00,000
Wait a minute. Wait a minute. Right here.

564
00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:04,000
And then right here.

565
00:36:04,000 --> 00:36:09,000
Am I going to play more vermin tide?

566
00:36:09,000 --> 00:36:18,000
I mean, really the reason why I'm streaming, I'm just taking a break from making my latest video.

567
00:36:18,000 --> 00:36:23,000
I ran into a spot where I'm just way home.

568
00:36:23,000 --> 00:36:26,000
Move out and in of the box.

569
00:36:26,000 --> 00:36:30,000
Oh, I'm a little chump.

570
00:36:30,000 --> 00:36:38,000
But my next video is just taking time to make.

571
00:36:38,000 --> 00:36:42,000
It's just like it's like I'm taking a break.

572
00:36:42,000 --> 00:36:44,000
I'm just like, I don't want to do it.

573
00:36:44,000 --> 00:36:47,000
I'm just going to stream for like an hour or two and then maybe do something.

574
00:36:47,000 --> 00:36:52,000
Maybe we're going a little more.

575
00:36:52,000 --> 00:36:56,000
Oh, one is up and one is down.

576
00:36:56,000 --> 00:36:59,000
Smart.

577
00:36:59,000 --> 00:37:02,000
He didn't even have to do it.

578
00:37:02,000 --> 00:37:07,000
He just jumped and threw his stuff.

579
00:37:07,000 --> 00:37:12,000
This is a fireball one.

580
00:37:12,000 --> 00:37:14,000
He killed it.

581
00:37:14,000 --> 00:37:17,000
All right, well, I'll just wait till he comes down here then.

582
00:37:17,000 --> 00:37:19,000
What do I care?

583
00:37:19,000 --> 00:37:24,000
He's going to get the coins. Just shoot him.

584
00:37:24,000 --> 00:37:25,000
That's why.

585
00:37:25,000 --> 00:37:28,000
So right when he's right in the middle is when I'm going to pop up.

586
00:37:28,000 --> 00:37:31,000
So right now.

587
00:37:31,000 --> 00:37:38,000
What does he do?

588
00:37:38,000 --> 00:37:41,000
So I have to wait till he gets down to the lower like the butt crack and the lower left

589
00:37:41,000 --> 00:37:45,000
and then I'll be all right.

590
00:37:45,000 --> 00:37:48,000
Walk into it.

591
00:37:48,000 --> 00:37:50,000
I can turn and I can shoot guys.

592
00:37:50,000 --> 00:37:54,000
I can turn and I can shoot.

593
00:37:54,000 --> 00:37:59,000
Did not know.

594
00:37:59,000 --> 00:38:04,000
Oh, that's kind of awkward.

595
00:38:04,000 --> 00:38:06,000
Does this even hurt him?

596
00:38:06,000 --> 00:38:08,000
I don't think I can hurt him yet.

597
00:38:08,000 --> 00:38:15,000
How am I going to get him to jump here though?

598
00:38:15,000 --> 00:38:16,000
Shit.

599
00:38:16,000 --> 00:38:28,000
Oh, that was too busy pay.

600
00:38:28,000 --> 00:38:33,000
Shoot the fucking right way you moron.

601
00:38:33,000 --> 00:38:38,000
This is much more awkward than it looks. Trust me.

602
00:38:38,000 --> 00:38:45,000
All right, just going to keep it right there.

603
00:38:45,000 --> 00:38:53,000
Just look at the zero stars. I don't care.

604
00:38:53,000 --> 00:38:56,000
So you can kill him.

605
00:38:56,000 --> 00:39:08,000
Obviously I have to wait till he turns and boost him up.

606
00:39:08,000 --> 00:39:13,000
What are you doing?

607
00:39:13,000 --> 00:39:20,000
No.

608
00:39:21,000 --> 00:39:27,000
No.

609
00:39:27,000 --> 00:39:31,000
No.

610
00:39:31,000 --> 00:39:33,000
You're going to scare him.

611
00:39:33,000 --> 00:39:34,000
So this comes up.

612
00:39:34,000 --> 00:39:46,000
Drop that. This comes up.

613
00:39:46,000 --> 00:39:57,000
I'm not doing this one right at all.

614
00:39:57,000 --> 00:40:01,000
I think I have to boost him up.

615
00:40:01,000 --> 00:40:04,000
So he jumps up on this one.

616
00:40:04,000 --> 00:40:08,000
So jump.

617
00:40:08,000 --> 00:40:11,000
Or does he have to hit both?

618
00:40:11,000 --> 00:40:13,000
Maybe he has to hit both.

619
00:40:13,000 --> 00:40:20,000
Make them both come out.

620
00:40:20,000 --> 00:40:23,000
Yeah, there we go.

621
00:40:23,000 --> 00:40:24,000
And there it is.

622
00:40:24,000 --> 00:40:25,000
One, two, three, four.

623
00:40:25,000 --> 00:40:26,000
Gotcha.

624
00:40:26,000 --> 00:40:28,000
My next plane how this works.

625
00:40:28,000 --> 00:40:41,000
You play as the enemies and you have to kill the AI Mario.

626
00:40:41,000 --> 00:40:45,000
Swim sideways with a deep head and swim up with A.

627
00:40:45,000 --> 00:40:47,000
Now you're a fish.

628
00:40:47,000 --> 00:40:50,000
Just get killed.

629
00:40:50,000 --> 00:40:53,000
100 lives lost.

630
00:40:53,000 --> 00:41:04,000
Cool.

631
00:41:04,000 --> 00:41:07,000
Airborne archer.

632
00:41:07,000 --> 00:41:10,000
Welcome to the jock shockers.

633
00:41:10,000 --> 00:41:11,000
Enjoy your stay.

634
00:41:11,000 --> 00:41:19,000
You are now a certified licensed shock joker.

635
00:41:19,000 --> 00:41:28,000
Shit.

636
00:41:28,000 --> 00:41:34,000
Maybe I should wait till he bumps into the wall.

637
00:41:34,000 --> 00:41:37,000
I don't know what to do.

638
00:41:37,000 --> 00:41:40,000
I'm going to send him sideways.

639
00:41:40,000 --> 00:41:41,000
See you.

640
00:41:41,000 --> 00:41:49,000
Bye bye.

641
00:41:49,000 --> 00:41:54,000
Same deal, right?

642
00:41:54,000 --> 00:41:58,000
That was three stars gone immediately.

643
00:41:58,000 --> 00:42:01,000
I can just lock him over here, right?

644
00:42:01,000 --> 00:42:08,000
I don't know.

645
00:42:08,000 --> 00:42:12,000
I wonder how do you do that one with three stars?

646
00:42:12,000 --> 00:42:15,000
I don't know.

647
00:42:15,000 --> 00:42:18,000
Yeah, if you're a subscriber to this channel,

648
00:42:18,000 --> 00:42:21,000
you obviously are certified shock jokking jock shocker.

649
00:42:21,000 --> 00:42:28,000
I mean, why wouldn't you be?

650
00:42:28,000 --> 00:42:29,000
I don't know.

651
00:42:29,000 --> 00:42:31,000
This one I think is just patience.

652
00:42:31,000 --> 00:42:32,000
He will jump.

653
00:42:32,000 --> 00:42:36,000
He will, okay, he will not jump to go to the flag.

654
00:42:36,000 --> 00:42:38,000
I can do this one a little more clearly.

655
00:42:38,000 --> 00:42:40,000
Make him get all the ones on the bottom.

656
00:42:40,000 --> 00:42:44,000
Make him jump and get this one.

657
00:42:44,000 --> 00:42:48,000
Maybe not all of them, but at this point, you know,

658
00:42:48,000 --> 00:42:50,000
who gives his shit?

659
00:42:50,000 --> 00:42:53,000
Just try to get him to collect the coins.

660
00:42:53,000 --> 00:42:55,000
I'm going to stay over here for this.

661
00:42:55,000 --> 00:42:57,000
I do not want him to get.

662
00:42:57,000 --> 00:42:59,000
He obviously has to get that one last.

663
00:42:59,000 --> 00:43:03,000
I went down to one star.

664
00:43:03,000 --> 00:43:05,000
Damn it.

665
00:43:05,000 --> 00:43:10,000
So how I hope to let him kill him when he does this?

666
00:43:10,000 --> 00:43:12,000
That's time, this right?

667
00:43:12,000 --> 00:43:14,000
Fucking it.

668
00:43:14,000 --> 00:43:19,000
Eat my ass.

669
00:43:19,000 --> 00:43:21,000
That was uncalled for.

670
00:43:21,000 --> 00:43:23,000
That was just completely uncalled for.

671
00:43:23,000 --> 00:43:27,000
Sorry.

672
00:43:27,000 --> 00:43:29,000
I know everyone asks about Germany and German rumble,

673
00:43:29,000 --> 00:43:31,000
but do you actually have plans for another one?

674
00:43:31,000 --> 00:43:32,000
I'm not asking.

675
00:43:32,000 --> 00:43:34,000
I don't even need to read the rest of this.

676
00:43:34,000 --> 00:43:35,000
I can give you an answer.

677
00:43:35,000 --> 00:43:38,000
Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, a thousand times.

678
00:43:38,000 --> 00:43:40,000
Yes.

679
00:43:40,000 --> 00:43:48,000
You're just going to have to trust me on this one.

680
00:43:48,000 --> 00:43:51,000
I want to see a new one just as bad as you do.

681
00:43:51,000 --> 00:43:58,000
You can quote me on that.

682
00:43:58,000 --> 00:43:59,000
And it will happen.

683
00:43:59,000 --> 00:44:08,000
It's going to happen.

684
00:44:08,000 --> 00:44:14,000
I'm glad you are as enthusiastic as I'm glad you're enthusiastic about it because it's

685
00:44:14,000 --> 00:44:20,000
like one of my favorite things to do.

686
00:44:20,000 --> 00:44:29,000
And this one will be absolutely no exception.

687
00:44:29,000 --> 00:44:36,000
Zero stars.

688
00:44:36,000 --> 00:44:45,000
Spring 2016 is when you can know that you'll see it.

689
00:44:45,000 --> 00:44:48,000
I am looking forward to it.

690
00:44:48,000 --> 00:44:51,000
More than probably any video I've probably ever made.

691
00:44:51,000 --> 00:44:53,000
Or ever will make.

692
00:44:53,000 --> 00:44:56,000
That's all I'm going to say.

693
00:44:56,000 --> 00:44:58,000
Swim sideways with a deep head and swim up with a.

694
00:44:58,000 --> 00:45:05,000
So just to be the octopus guy.

695
00:45:05,000 --> 00:45:10,000
I did it again.

696
00:45:10,000 --> 00:45:15,000
I just pixel perfect.

697
00:45:15,000 --> 00:45:16,000
I did it again.

698
00:45:16,000 --> 00:45:17,000
I did it again.

699
00:45:17,000 --> 00:45:18,000
I did it like a fourth time in a row.

700
00:45:18,000 --> 00:45:20,000
Just let him walk into you.

701
00:45:20,000 --> 00:45:21,000
I did it again.

702
00:45:21,000 --> 00:45:22,000
I did it again.

703
00:45:22,000 --> 00:45:33,000
Thank God the pixels lined up.

704
00:45:33,000 --> 00:45:34,000
Well, that's different.

705
00:45:34,000 --> 00:45:39,000
That is a different pattern.

706
00:45:39,000 --> 00:45:44,000
Right there.

707
00:45:44,000 --> 00:45:46,000
Right in the V.

708
00:45:46,000 --> 00:45:48,000
Just going to swim in the V.

709
00:45:48,000 --> 00:45:50,000
We just like the mighty ducks.

710
00:45:50,000 --> 00:45:51,000
That's the idea.

711
00:45:51,000 --> 00:45:56,000
But I've got to get it.

712
00:45:56,000 --> 00:46:02,000
Got it.

713
00:46:02,000 --> 00:46:06,000
I got a couple of little ones now.

714
00:46:06,000 --> 00:46:08,000
I think I get what they want me to do here.

715
00:46:08,000 --> 00:46:12,000
I think it's collect all these little guys and just stick them out and have them walk into it.

716
00:46:12,000 --> 00:46:14,000
That's what we're going to do.

717
00:46:14,000 --> 00:46:17,000
And that's what we needed to do.

718
00:46:23,000 --> 00:46:24,000
Oh, shit.

719
00:46:24,000 --> 00:46:25,000
What am I doing?

720
00:46:25,000 --> 00:46:27,000
He's invincible.

721
00:46:27,000 --> 00:46:30,000
Will he just fall down and collect these?

722
00:46:30,000 --> 00:46:31,000
No, I got him.

723
00:46:31,000 --> 00:46:34,000
Ah, this sucks.

724
00:46:34,000 --> 00:46:41,000
So he's going to shoot right when he lends.

725
00:46:41,000 --> 00:46:44,000
Ah.

726
00:46:44,000 --> 00:46:45,000
Ah.

727
00:46:45,000 --> 00:46:52,000
Just come on.

728
00:46:52,000 --> 00:46:54,000
Just get it.

729
00:46:54,000 --> 00:46:56,000
Just get it.

730
00:46:56,000 --> 00:46:59,000
That's so trolled.

731
00:46:59,000 --> 00:47:01,000
Really is.

732
00:47:01,000 --> 00:47:03,000
Really is.

733
00:47:03,000 --> 00:47:10,000
I'm just...

734
00:47:10,000 --> 00:47:15,000
Then he doesn't even do it.

735
00:47:15,000 --> 00:47:17,000
No, don't look at that.

736
00:47:17,000 --> 00:47:20,000
Goodness.

737
00:47:20,000 --> 00:47:29,000
Fuck.

738
00:47:29,000 --> 00:47:34,000
That's kind.

739
00:47:34,000 --> 00:47:36,000
Just be easy.

740
00:47:36,000 --> 00:47:37,000
That's should...

741
00:47:37,000 --> 00:47:38,000
He shouldn't have even done it like that.

742
00:47:38,000 --> 00:47:39,000
He should have landed in a shot.

743
00:47:39,000 --> 00:47:49,000
That was not even something I would consider cool.

744
00:47:49,000 --> 00:47:52,000
Why is he not jumping?

745
00:47:52,000 --> 00:47:54,000
He's supposed to jump when he sees me.

746
00:47:54,000 --> 00:47:56,000
He's supposed to jump over me.

747
00:47:56,000 --> 00:47:57,000
Just like that.

748
00:47:57,000 --> 00:47:58,000
He did it.

749
00:47:58,000 --> 00:48:01,000
Now just don't do not die from the...

750
00:48:01,000 --> 00:48:06,000
He's used months.

751
00:48:06,000 --> 00:48:09,000
We're gonna get tickets for the next drama rumble.

752
00:48:09,000 --> 00:48:12,000
Well, it's gonna be free and on YouTube.

753
00:48:12,000 --> 00:48:14,000
I die.

754
00:48:14,000 --> 00:48:21,000
This woman's dash fall would be.

755
00:48:21,000 --> 00:48:23,000
Come here.

756
00:48:23,000 --> 00:48:25,000
Get away.

757
00:48:25,000 --> 00:48:27,000
I'm gonna get you.

758
00:48:27,000 --> 00:48:28,000
I'll get you.

759
00:48:28,000 --> 00:48:31,000
Gotta be fast, but...

760
00:48:31,000 --> 00:48:35,000
Gotta fucking quick.

761
00:48:35,000 --> 00:48:45,000
Gotta be quick.

762
00:48:45,000 --> 00:48:49,000
Can I fit through here?

763
00:48:49,000 --> 00:48:50,000
No.

764
00:48:50,000 --> 00:48:53,000
Okay.

765
00:48:54,000 --> 00:48:55,000
Ooh.

766
00:48:55,000 --> 00:48:56,000
So that's dropping.

767
00:48:56,000 --> 00:48:57,000
Okay.

768
00:48:57,000 --> 00:48:58,000
So smash.

769
00:48:58,000 --> 00:49:00,000
Smash.

770
00:49:00,000 --> 00:49:03,000
Fuck.

771
00:49:03,000 --> 00:49:06,000
Fuck.

772
00:49:06,000 --> 00:49:12,000
Okay, slow it out.

773
00:49:12,000 --> 00:49:16,000
Slow it out.

774
00:49:16,000 --> 00:49:23,000
Yeah, bring him right where you'll want him.

775
00:49:23,000 --> 00:49:24,000
Okay.

776
00:49:24,000 --> 00:49:25,000
Slow, slow, slow.

777
00:49:25,000 --> 00:49:30,000
It literally drops.

778
00:49:30,000 --> 00:49:32,000
Did he seriously squeak by?

779
00:49:32,000 --> 00:49:38,000
He squeaked through and now he stuck over here?

780
00:49:38,000 --> 00:49:39,000
I don't even feel like that.

781
00:49:39,000 --> 00:49:42,000
That's even...

782
00:49:42,000 --> 00:49:45,000
Just restart it.

783
00:49:45,000 --> 00:49:52,000
Not on my watch.

784
00:49:52,000 --> 00:49:59,000
That's some aggressive clicking.

785
00:49:59,000 --> 00:50:06,000
Yeah, it kind of is.

786
00:50:06,000 --> 00:50:07,000
I get it.

787
00:50:07,000 --> 00:50:08,000
I know what the woman to do.

788
00:50:08,000 --> 00:50:12,000
They want me to go back and forth.

789
00:50:12,000 --> 00:50:13,000
Shit.

790
00:50:13,000 --> 00:50:17,000
I gotta fall all the way down here.

791
00:50:17,000 --> 00:50:18,000
Not that far.

792
00:50:18,000 --> 00:50:20,000
Not that far.

793
00:50:20,000 --> 00:50:23,000
Not that far.

794
00:50:23,000 --> 00:50:30,000
Right there.

795
00:50:30,000 --> 00:50:31,000
All right.

796
00:50:31,000 --> 00:50:32,000
Right in the middle.

797
00:50:32,000 --> 00:50:36,000
I'm thinking right in the middle, right?

798
00:50:36,000 --> 00:50:41,000
I was holding down the button, by the way.

799
00:50:42,000 --> 00:50:44,000
He's not going to hit me from right in the middle.

800
00:50:44,000 --> 00:50:45,000
Of course he will.

801
00:50:45,000 --> 00:50:47,000
Of course he'll still hit me.

802
00:50:47,000 --> 00:50:54,000
Of course he'll hit me there too.

803
00:50:54,000 --> 00:51:01,000
I've about to do a little bit of, I've been raging.

804
00:51:01,000 --> 00:51:04,000
One, two, three, four.

805
00:51:04,000 --> 00:51:06,000
Smash.

806
00:51:06,000 --> 00:51:11,000
Ah!

807
00:51:11,000 --> 00:51:14,000
So you gotta do two spaces.

808
00:51:14,000 --> 00:51:17,000
When he gets these coins, please do not.

809
00:51:17,000 --> 00:51:21,000
Please come on.

810
00:51:21,000 --> 00:51:24,000
I'm being a little whiner right now.

811
00:51:24,000 --> 00:51:25,000
I'll get it.

812
00:51:25,000 --> 00:51:30,000
And then one, two.

813
00:51:30,000 --> 00:51:33,000
Now I just have to not die.

814
00:51:34,000 --> 00:51:39,000
And then right when he grabs that coin.

815
00:51:39,000 --> 00:51:40,000
Wipe it off.

816
00:51:40,000 --> 00:51:41,000
Wipe off.

817
00:51:41,000 --> 00:51:42,000
I give one star.

818
00:51:42,000 --> 00:51:47,000
It's perfect.

819
00:51:47,000 --> 00:51:50,000
All right.

820
00:51:50,000 --> 00:51:52,000
What is he supposed to be grabbing?

821
00:51:52,000 --> 00:51:55,000
Oh, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

822
00:51:55,000 --> 00:51:59,000
Go all the way up.

823
00:51:59,000 --> 00:52:01,000
You can shoot up.

824
00:52:01,000 --> 00:52:04,000
That's such a bullshit.

825
00:52:04,000 --> 00:52:06,000
I had the right idea.

826
00:52:06,000 --> 00:52:11,000
Gotta go all the way up to the top.

827
00:52:11,000 --> 00:52:12,000
I do that again.

828
00:52:12,000 --> 00:52:18,000
I swear to God, I'm gonna put this controller into the drywall.

829
00:52:18,000 --> 00:52:20,000
It hurts.

830
00:52:20,000 --> 00:52:23,000
It hurts.

831
00:52:23,000 --> 00:52:24,000
Why is it bouncing?

832
00:52:24,000 --> 00:52:26,000
There should not be an added fucking flop on this.

833
00:52:26,000 --> 00:52:30,000
You should be fucking bouncing.

834
00:52:30,000 --> 00:52:37,000
No, God.

835
00:52:37,000 --> 00:52:41,000
Ugh.

836
00:52:41,000 --> 00:52:48,000
Get out of the way.

837
00:52:48,000 --> 00:52:49,000
Get out of the way.

838
00:52:49,000 --> 00:52:52,000
Get out of the way.

839
00:52:52,000 --> 00:52:55,000
Out of the way.

840
00:52:55,000 --> 00:52:57,000
I don't care about three stars.

841
00:52:57,000 --> 00:52:59,000
I just want to win.

842
00:52:59,000 --> 00:53:01,000
Crush him.

843
00:53:01,000 --> 00:53:04,000
Crush him.

844
00:53:04,000 --> 00:53:06,000
Nice relaxing game.

845
00:53:06,000 --> 00:53:15,000
Don't cry, Princess.

846
00:53:15,000 --> 00:53:21,000
We have trapped your stalker plumber forever in the minus world.

847
00:53:21,000 --> 00:53:25,000
We are now safe here on this island.

848
00:53:25,000 --> 00:53:28,000
We won.

849
00:53:28,000 --> 00:53:34,000
We won.

850
00:53:34,000 --> 00:53:37,000
Is there a minute I can go back here?

851
00:53:37,000 --> 00:53:38,000
No.

852
00:53:38,000 --> 00:53:40,000
15 more stars.

853
00:53:40,000 --> 00:53:43,000
Are there even 15 stars available to get here?

854
00:53:43,000 --> 00:53:46,000
Five?

855
00:53:46,000 --> 00:53:51,000
Yeah, I have to do three stars on every single level.

856
00:53:51,000 --> 00:53:53,000
Fuck that.

857
00:53:53,000 --> 00:53:54,000
I can't see you.

858
00:53:54,000 --> 00:54:02,000
We are in the ice level now.

859
00:54:02,000 --> 00:54:08,000
Why is he like a maniacal psycho?

860
00:54:08,000 --> 00:54:11,000
He will pay with his blood.

861
00:54:11,000 --> 00:54:17,000
So he is still winning.

862
00:54:17,000 --> 00:54:19,000
I'm assuming there is going to be a lot of slip in his lead.

863
00:54:19,000 --> 00:54:23,000
And it's a nice level.

864
00:54:23,000 --> 00:54:31,000
What a dummy.

865
00:54:31,000 --> 00:54:39,000
Okay, so we obviously have to just get him stuck.

866
00:54:39,000 --> 00:54:44,000
Can't jump.

867
00:54:44,000 --> 00:54:58,000
I'm not going to jump over it.

868
00:54:58,000 --> 00:55:02,000
I'm not over that.

869
00:55:02,000 --> 00:55:11,000
How is he not jumping on that?

870
00:55:11,000 --> 00:55:21,000
I'm going to have to get it next time.

871
00:55:21,000 --> 00:55:25,000
Oh, I freaked out again.

872
00:55:25,000 --> 00:55:32,000
I hate controlling two characters.

873
00:55:32,000 --> 00:55:37,000
I walked off the screen with this other guy.

874
00:55:37,000 --> 00:55:45,000
I'm going to get him stuck in the game.

875
00:55:45,000 --> 00:55:51,000
Numbers are plummeting.

876
00:55:51,000 --> 00:55:58,000
And then I get to follow him.

877
00:55:58,000 --> 00:55:59,000
I'm just running quick enough.

878
00:55:59,000 --> 00:56:06,000
I still might be able to do it.

879
00:56:06,000 --> 00:56:12,000
I'm going to get him stuck.

880
00:56:12,000 --> 00:56:18,000
Why am I blue?

881
00:56:18,000 --> 00:56:22,000
Interesting.

882
00:56:22,000 --> 00:56:26,000
It hurts my head.

883
00:56:26,000 --> 00:56:30,000
You have to hold right the whole time.

884
00:56:30,000 --> 00:56:38,000
Right is left and left is right down there.

885
00:56:38,000 --> 00:56:42,000
Oh, forget that.

886
00:56:42,000 --> 00:56:50,000
I'm assuming he's going to go like that.

887
00:56:50,000 --> 00:56:54,000
Oh, let him look as bark.

888
00:56:54,000 --> 00:57:02,000
He's going to be easy on him.

889
00:57:02,000 --> 00:57:06,000
Oh, I just hit the blast.

890
00:57:06,000 --> 00:57:12,000
I have to last the whole time with it.

891
00:57:12,000 --> 00:57:16,000
Is this the only safe spot here on the right?

892
00:57:16,000 --> 00:57:18,000
Kind of.

893
00:57:18,000 --> 00:57:24,000
I'm not going to be able to do that.

894
00:57:24,000 --> 00:57:28,000
He jumps up.

895
00:57:28,000 --> 00:57:32,000
He lands on the top.

896
00:57:32,000 --> 00:57:36,000
He shoots here.

897
00:57:36,000 --> 00:57:40,000
All the way to the left.

898
00:57:40,000 --> 00:57:44,000
All the way to the right.

899
00:57:44,000 --> 00:57:50,000
Hey, sweet chili Charlie.

900
00:57:50,000 --> 00:57:52,000
What's his name?

901
00:57:52,000 --> 00:57:56,000
Oh, sweatpants, man.

902
00:57:56,000 --> 00:58:00,000
Welcome to the shed stands.

903
00:58:00,000 --> 00:58:04,000
Nice to meet you.

904
00:58:04,000 --> 00:58:22,000
This is fucking too hard for me to do.

905
00:58:22,000 --> 00:58:24,000
Does the moon work?

906
00:58:24,000 --> 00:58:28,000
Does German moon work yet?

907
00:58:28,000 --> 00:58:30,000
When is that going to work?

908
00:58:30,000 --> 00:58:34,000
I just have to scare him and jump in, right?

909
00:58:34,000 --> 00:58:36,000
So like this?

910
00:58:36,000 --> 00:58:38,000
No.

911
00:58:38,000 --> 00:58:42,000
How do I get him to jump?

912
00:58:42,000 --> 00:58:46,000
Do I have to be in the bottom?

913
00:58:46,000 --> 00:58:50,000
I guess it has to be when they're facing this way.

914
00:58:50,000 --> 00:58:54,000
I don't know.

915
00:58:54,000 --> 00:58:58,000
How do I get him to confuse again?

916
00:58:58,000 --> 00:59:08,000
I guess it doesn't work.

917
00:59:08,000 --> 00:59:10,000
I just did it.

918
00:59:10,000 --> 00:59:12,000
How do I do that?

919
00:59:12,000 --> 00:59:16,000
I figured it out.

920
00:59:16,000 --> 00:59:18,000
No, you dumb idiot.

921
00:59:18,000 --> 00:59:26,000
Stupid wrong wrong wrong wrong wrong wrong wrong wrong wrong wrong wrong wrong wrong wrong.

922
00:59:26,000 --> 00:59:34,000
Wrong wrong wrong idiot stupid dumb moron.

923
00:59:34,000 --> 00:59:38,000
I kind of was right.

924
00:59:38,000 --> 00:59:48,000
Why is it not working half the time?

925
00:59:48,000 --> 00:59:54,000
Part of me feels like this shit just should be working but it just ain't.

926
00:59:54,000 --> 00:59:58,000
The other half of me just wants to never play the game again.

927
00:59:58,000 --> 01:00:02,000
But we're this far, right?

928
01:00:02,000 --> 01:00:06,000
What actually makes him jump?

929
01:00:06,000 --> 01:00:08,000
I don't know.

930
01:00:08,000 --> 01:00:10,000
I have no damn mind.

931
01:00:10,000 --> 01:00:14,000
What actually makes this fucking asshole jump?

932
01:00:14,000 --> 01:00:16,000
Is that really it?

933
01:00:16,000 --> 01:00:20,000
Did I just get the sequence of fucking universe here?

934
01:00:20,000 --> 01:00:28,000
Now that guy just might have figured out the sequence of fucking universe guys.

935
01:00:28,000 --> 01:00:36,000
The sequence of fucking universe.

936
01:00:36,000 --> 01:00:38,000
Check out the sequence of fucking universe.

937
01:00:38,000 --> 01:00:40,000
Come on!

938
01:00:40,000 --> 01:00:42,000
Damn it!

939
01:00:42,000 --> 01:00:48,000
I'm not happy.

940
01:00:48,000 --> 01:00:52,000
Why is there not a professional streamer gamer?

941
01:00:52,000 --> 01:00:56,000
Whatever you're saying.

942
01:00:56,000 --> 01:01:02,000
What are you talking about?

943
01:01:02,000 --> 01:01:04,000
He just clipped through to the land on me.

944
01:01:04,000 --> 01:01:06,000
He clipped through to this fucking asshole.

945
01:01:06,000 --> 01:01:08,000
This stupid plumber.

946
01:01:08,000 --> 01:01:10,000
This dumb plumber guy.

947
01:01:10,000 --> 01:01:14,000
Thought he could just clipped through.

948
01:01:14,000 --> 01:01:18,000
Now I'll give you a clip.

949
01:01:18,000 --> 01:01:20,000
It's the backwards.

950
01:01:20,000 --> 01:01:22,000
Right is left and left is right.

951
01:01:22,000 --> 01:01:28,000
It's gonna screw me up a thousand times.

952
01:01:28,000 --> 01:01:30,000
Nice.

953
01:01:30,000 --> 01:01:36,000
Screwed it up again.

954
01:01:36,000 --> 01:01:38,000
So close.

955
01:01:38,000 --> 01:01:40,000
So what are you doing?

956
01:01:40,000 --> 01:01:42,000
Wait till he gets down here.

957
01:01:42,000 --> 01:01:44,000
I forget everything.

958
01:01:44,000 --> 01:01:46,000
I remember.

959
01:01:46,000 --> 01:01:48,000
I forget.

960
01:01:48,000 --> 01:01:50,000
I remember.

961
01:01:50,000 --> 01:01:52,000
I forget!

962
01:01:52,000 --> 01:01:58,000
Right is left and left is right.

963
01:01:58,000 --> 01:02:00,000
Why did he jump there?

964
01:02:00,000 --> 01:02:02,000
Of all places?

965
01:02:02,000 --> 01:02:04,000
Why did he jump there?

966
01:02:04,000 --> 01:02:06,000
That was so dumb.

967
01:02:06,000 --> 01:02:08,000
He did it again.

968
01:02:08,000 --> 01:02:10,000
Telling me.

969
01:02:10,000 --> 01:02:12,000
I'm gonna get a picture right now.

970
01:02:12,000 --> 01:02:16,000
Causing me all kinds of hell.

971
01:02:16,000 --> 01:02:24,000
I just wish the clipping.

972
01:02:24,000 --> 01:02:28,000
I wish he actually had to jump on me.

973
01:02:28,000 --> 01:02:34,000
I gotta feeling this stream will end soon.

974
01:02:34,000 --> 01:02:36,000
Maybe.

975
01:02:36,000 --> 01:02:38,000
That was it.

976
01:02:38,000 --> 01:02:40,000
I shouldn't do it.

977
01:02:40,000 --> 01:02:42,000
He didn't go the whole way.

978
01:02:42,000 --> 01:02:44,000
I should get it right here.

979
01:02:44,000 --> 01:02:48,000
I don't know what he didn't do it again.

980
01:02:48,000 --> 01:02:50,000
There it is.

981
01:02:50,000 --> 01:02:54,000
Finally.

982
01:02:54,000 --> 01:02:56,000
What is it?

983
01:02:56,000 --> 01:02:58,000
I got a little hat.

984
01:02:58,000 --> 01:03:02,000
Does that mean anything?

985
01:03:02,000 --> 01:03:06,000
Why am I getting like wood slowdowns right there?

986
01:03:06,000 --> 01:03:12,000
I should not be getting three-dimensional lag in a two-dimensional game.

987
01:03:12,000 --> 01:03:14,000
I'm just gonna have to wait for him.

988
01:03:14,000 --> 01:03:16,000
He's eventually here to jump.

989
01:03:16,000 --> 01:03:18,000
He's gonna have to jump eventually.

990
01:03:18,000 --> 01:03:20,000
Right.

991
01:03:20,000 --> 01:03:22,000
He's eventually here to jump.

992
01:03:22,000 --> 01:03:24,000
He's gonna have to jump eventually.

993
01:03:24,000 --> 01:03:26,000
Right.

994
01:03:26,000 --> 01:03:32,000
I hope to do.

995
01:03:32,000 --> 01:03:34,000
Yeah, I hope to do.

996
01:03:34,000 --> 01:03:38,000
I hope to do.

997
01:03:38,000 --> 01:03:42,000
I hope to do.

998
01:03:42,000 --> 01:03:44,000
I hope to do.

999
01:03:44,000 --> 01:03:46,000
I hope to do.

1000
01:03:46,000 --> 01:03:48,000
I hope to do.

1001
01:03:48,000 --> 01:03:50,000
Yeah, we're gonna...

1002
01:03:50,000 --> 01:03:52,000
I'll just bore him to death.

1003
01:04:04,000 --> 01:04:06,000
It doesn't matter.

1004
01:04:06,000 --> 01:04:08,000
He's not going anywhere.

1005
01:04:08,000 --> 01:04:10,000
He's not gonna move.

1006
01:04:14,000 --> 01:04:16,000
What am I supposed to do then?

1007
01:04:16,000 --> 01:04:18,000
Go take a shower.

1008
01:04:18,000 --> 01:04:26,000
Yeah, everyone just got mad at me for moving and I'm not moving and then nothing happened.

1009
01:04:26,000 --> 01:04:28,000
I'm gonna move.

1010
01:04:28,000 --> 01:04:30,000
I have a little...

1011
01:04:30,000 --> 01:04:32,000
An opportunity.

1012
01:04:32,000 --> 01:04:34,000
Like I have a small window.

1013
01:04:34,000 --> 01:04:36,000
See how I'm like walking still?

1014
01:04:36,000 --> 01:04:40,000
I sure I can't fly with this hat.

1015
01:04:40,000 --> 01:04:42,000
Didn't they tell me about the snowballs?

1016
01:04:42,000 --> 01:04:44,000
When did they tell me about the snowballs?

1017
01:04:44,000 --> 01:04:46,000
They never told me about the snowballs.

1018
01:04:46,000 --> 01:04:50,000
Well, just got to make it bounce correctly.

1019
01:04:50,000 --> 01:04:52,000
I wish I knew about that before.

1020
01:04:52,000 --> 01:04:56,000
They saved me a lot of bullshit.

1021
01:04:56,000 --> 01:05:00,000
I didn't write in his nuts.

1022
01:05:00,000 --> 01:05:02,000
I don't know.

1023
01:05:02,000 --> 01:05:04,000
I don't know.

1024
01:05:04,000 --> 01:05:06,000
I don't know.

1025
01:05:06,000 --> 01:05:08,000
I don't know.

1026
01:05:08,000 --> 01:05:10,000
I don't know.

1027
01:05:10,000 --> 01:05:12,000
I don't know.

1028
01:05:12,000 --> 01:05:14,000
Yeah, going right kills you.

1029
01:05:14,000 --> 01:05:16,000
You just have to...

1030
01:05:16,000 --> 01:05:18,000
You just gotta get this like perfect.

1031
01:05:18,000 --> 01:05:20,000
That was not perfect.

1032
01:05:20,000 --> 01:05:22,000
One, two...

1033
01:05:22,000 --> 01:05:24,000
Okay.

1034
01:05:25,000 --> 01:05:27,000
That was not perfect.

1035
01:05:27,000 --> 01:05:37,000
One, two, okay.

1036
01:05:37,000 --> 01:05:46,000
Maybe right on the back end of it?

1037
01:05:46,000 --> 01:05:50,000
I'm gonna have to get it right on the right side.

1038
01:05:50,000 --> 01:05:52,000
Like right there if I can.

1039
01:05:52,000 --> 01:06:05,000
close

1040
01:06:05,000 --> 01:06:10,000
I don't care about the time or anymore I just want to win

1041
01:06:10,000 --> 01:06:17,000
I'm not going to lose my goddamn mind. Thank you. Thank you.

1042
01:06:26,000 --> 01:06:28,000
Just spam.

1043
01:06:28,000 --> 01:06:34,000
Spam. Snowballs who cares.

1044
01:06:34,000 --> 01:06:39,000
That was actually going to work kind of.

1045
01:06:39,000 --> 01:06:46,000
I feel like I'm playing one of those elaborate mini golf games where you have to land it perfectly.

1046
01:06:55,000 --> 01:06:57,000
That's what I have to do here.

1047
01:06:57,000 --> 01:07:01,000
I have to use that kind of little double jump that you get from throwing the snowball.

1048
01:07:02,000 --> 01:07:06,000
Let's get back.

1049
01:07:06,000 --> 01:07:10,000
There it is.

1050
01:07:10,000 --> 01:07:14,000
Gorgeous.

1051
01:07:14,000 --> 01:07:18,000
I got confused because I didn't know.

1052
01:07:18,000 --> 01:07:23,000
I thought I was still controlling the little snow people.

1053
01:07:23,000 --> 01:07:27,000
Really?

1054
01:07:28,000 --> 01:07:34,000
What are you going?

1055
01:07:34,000 --> 01:07:41,000
Zero stars. That's just not cool.

1056
01:07:41,000 --> 01:07:46,000
There we go.

1057
01:07:46,000 --> 01:07:53,000
I'm going to get him to jump to the left to his underwater.

1058
01:07:53,000 --> 01:08:00,000
It's one, two, one, two.

1059
01:08:23,000 --> 01:08:30,000
I'm not going to lie guys. I could sit here and figure this out but I kind of just want to do this until it works.

1060
01:08:30,000 --> 01:08:37,000
I could care less right now.

1061
01:08:45,000 --> 01:08:49,000
And there we go.

1062
01:08:49,000 --> 01:08:54,000
I'm using Oculus Rift for pre-order January 6th.

1063
01:08:54,000 --> 01:08:59,000
I probably puke if I play Oculus Rift.

1064
01:08:59,000 --> 01:09:04,000
I will throw up if I play anything on Oculus Rift.

1065
01:09:04,000 --> 01:09:07,000
I'm missing something.

1066
01:09:07,000 --> 01:09:12,000
I got to get him to hit the spikes.

1067
01:09:12,000 --> 01:09:19,000
Or not. Just shoot him right in the stomach. That works.

1068
01:09:19,000 --> 01:09:26,000
That was so close.

1069
01:09:32,000 --> 01:09:38,000
That'll be quicker than that.

1070
01:09:38,000 --> 01:09:43,000
He's hitting the other one accidentally.

1071
01:09:55,000 --> 01:10:02,000
He can toss his brain out.

1072
01:10:03,000 --> 01:10:08,000
I'm assuming I need to keep both of their helmets.

1073
01:10:14,000 --> 01:10:17,000
See you later.

1074
01:10:17,000 --> 01:10:21,000
Do I break stuff when I get angry? No, not really.

1075
01:10:21,000 --> 01:10:25,000
I kind of just say a couple of swear words and then I'm done with it.

1076
01:10:25,000 --> 01:10:31,000
I can walk my day.

1077
01:10:33,000 --> 01:10:37,000
It actually does.

1078
01:10:42,000 --> 01:10:47,000
I don't want to die.

1079
01:10:47,000 --> 01:10:52,000
Am I crazy or did they regenerate last time?

1080
01:10:52,000 --> 01:10:58,000
I felt like they did.

1081
01:10:59,000 --> 01:11:04,000
Shit.

1082
01:11:04,000 --> 01:11:10,000
I hit the button accidentally.

1083
01:11:10,000 --> 01:11:15,000
How am I going to kill him, by the way?

1084
01:11:15,000 --> 01:11:20,000
If I get him to do this, how am I going to actually kill him?

1085
01:11:20,000 --> 01:11:25,000
I didn't really think about that.

1086
01:11:29,000 --> 01:11:35,000
If he lands on one, will they stay dead?

1087
01:11:35,000 --> 01:11:40,000
Or will they come back?

1088
01:11:47,000 --> 01:11:53,000
I think I just would be perfect when he lands.

1089
01:11:53,000 --> 01:11:58,000
I'm getting some weird slowdowns here too.

1090
01:11:58,000 --> 01:12:05,000
Right when he jumps right here.

1091
01:12:05,000 --> 01:12:10,000
I'll definitely lag.

1092
01:12:10,000 --> 01:12:15,000
There we go.

1093
01:12:15,000 --> 01:12:20,000
There we go.

1094
01:12:37,000 --> 01:12:44,000
I almost had the first try.

1095
01:12:44,000 --> 01:12:49,000
I'm going to see.

1096
01:12:49,000 --> 01:12:54,000
Three stats.

1097
01:12:54,000 --> 01:13:01,000
Kind of lucky.

1098
01:13:01,000 --> 01:13:08,000
That was like the same level without the whole.

1099
01:13:08,000 --> 01:13:13,000
I'm going to take a little bit of a.

1100
01:13:13,000 --> 01:13:18,000
All right let me just.

1101
01:13:18,000 --> 01:13:23,000
Let me just let me do something here.

1102
01:13:23,000 --> 01:13:28,000
Let me just figure this out.

1103
01:13:28,000 --> 01:13:33,000
I can't go through it.

1104
01:13:33,000 --> 01:13:38,000
I thought I could go through it or something.

1105
01:13:38,000 --> 01:13:43,000
I'm going to pee my pants.

1106
01:13:43,000 --> 01:13:50,000
Hopefully I can end this soon.

1107
01:13:50,000 --> 01:13:53,000
Shit.

1108
01:13:53,000 --> 01:13:58,000
That's a way to go though.

1109
01:13:58,000 --> 01:14:03,000
I'm going to get a little bit of a.

1110
01:14:03,000 --> 01:14:08,000
Shit.

1111
01:14:08,000 --> 01:14:13,000
Shit.

1112
01:14:13,000 --> 01:14:20,000
All right I think this might be the last level.

1113
01:14:20,000 --> 01:14:25,000
What's wrong with my guy?

1114
01:14:25,000 --> 01:14:30,000
He's going to get the last level.

1115
01:14:30,000 --> 01:14:33,000
These guys don't really do anything.

1116
01:14:33,000 --> 01:14:38,000
They do not get hurt from the fire.

1117
01:14:38,000 --> 01:14:43,000
Can they get stepped on?

1118
01:14:43,000 --> 01:14:48,000
I want to see if they can get stepped on.

1119
01:14:48,000 --> 01:14:54,000
You know, I'm gonna assume these are like the bone characters in Mario where they come back to life and I'm gonna have to make somebody go down

1120
01:15:02,000 --> 01:15:04,000
Let's see if that theory is true

1121
01:15:06,000 --> 01:15:08,000
Yes, it is

1122
01:15:08,000 --> 01:15:10,000
Yes, it is I

1123
01:15:10,000 --> 01:15:13,000
Have to set these guys up in a spot where

1124
01:15:14,000 --> 01:15:17,000
Oh, and especially needing to pee is it gonna be tough

1125
01:15:20,000 --> 01:15:22,000
They have to stay on their respective levels, I think

1126
01:15:25,000 --> 01:15:27,000
One

1127
01:15:35,000 --> 01:15:37,000
Space like this for a reason

1128
01:15:38,000 --> 01:15:40,000
Shit

1129
01:15:41,000 --> 01:15:44,000
That may have just been my ticket to make him go up there

1130
01:15:56,000 --> 01:15:59,000
Kind of right I think

1131
01:16:05,000 --> 01:16:07,000
Why does he go jump and get that first one?

1132
01:16:08,000 --> 01:16:10,000
So you have to make him go

1133
01:16:11,000 --> 01:16:13,000
Up and then I

1134
01:16:17,000 --> 01:16:22,000
Think now I have to bring him down. Yeah, yeah

1135
01:16:30,000 --> 01:16:35,000
No stop doing the things I don't tell you to do we're gonna have a cat amperum

1136
01:16:41,000 --> 01:16:46,000
Okay, now technically I shouldn't need to care about that guy

1137
01:16:48,000 --> 01:16:50,000
And now how does he get up there

1138
01:16:57,000 --> 01:16:59,000
He blew it already

1139
01:17:11,000 --> 01:17:15,000
It's the way that they're spaced I almost need another person

1140
01:17:19,000 --> 01:17:25,000
Just kind of confused on how you get him to jump over there unless I have to I kind of have to bring them down right

1141
01:17:26,000 --> 01:17:28,000
Yeah, I'm gonna be slow with this one

1142
01:17:31,000 --> 01:17:33,000
Oh you fucking you

1143
01:17:40,000 --> 01:17:42,000
I

1144
01:17:51,000 --> 01:17:56,000
Don't think you can do it like that because he'll just hit it every time

1145
01:17:58,000 --> 01:18:01,000
Long to fight thank you for subscribing welcome to the

1146
01:18:02,000 --> 01:18:05,000
Whatever I'm calling people thanks for something it's gonna

1147
01:18:06,000 --> 01:18:08,000
Thank you very much welcome welcome welcome

1148
01:18:10,000 --> 01:18:22,000
The way that they're spaced almost leads me to believe right now this might sound crazy

1149
01:18:24,000 --> 01:18:27,000
This might sound crazy I am crazy it's wrong

1150
01:18:27,000 --> 01:18:29,000
I

1151
01:18:38,000 --> 01:18:40,000
Don't think he can jump up here

1152
01:18:42,000 --> 01:18:46,000
Can he even make that jump hey he gets up there, but shit

1153
01:18:48,000 --> 01:18:54,000
I think I got it I think I got it I think I got it. I'm pretty sure I got it. I'm pretty sure I figured it out I think

1154
01:18:54,000 --> 01:18:58,000
He gets that one he'll jump over here and

1155
01:18:59,000 --> 01:19:02,000
Then this needs this guy needs to be over here

1156
01:19:02,000 --> 01:19:06,000
Because then he can jump this way up there oh

1157
01:19:09,000 --> 01:19:11,000
Wait, how do I kill him?

1158
01:19:11,000 --> 01:19:13,000
How do I kill him?

1159
01:19:13,000 --> 01:19:17,000
I don't know how I'm gonna kill him and I'm scared because I don't that I was gonna okay. I know how to do it

1160
01:19:18,000 --> 01:19:23,000
I got a I think no, I don't how do I kill this guy now? What do I do somebody please tell me before I die?

1161
01:19:24,000 --> 01:19:26,000
Oh

1162
01:19:31,000 --> 01:19:36,000
That's what you gotta do I don't care about zero stars

1163
01:19:39,000 --> 01:19:41,000
I gotta say I gotta be so slow with this

1164
01:19:47,000 --> 01:19:50,000
New best zero with we're staying with it. I don't care

1165
01:19:55,000 --> 01:19:57,000
Oh right

1166
01:20:00,000 --> 01:20:02,000
I was thinking I could clip him

1167
01:20:07,000 --> 01:20:09,000
This music doesn't fit by the way

1168
01:20:11,000 --> 01:20:13,000
This music is like the price is right

1169
01:20:16,000 --> 01:20:21,000
This is the song they play when you guess correctly the amount of money something is on the price is right then

1170
01:20:21,000 --> 01:20:24,000
Then Bob Barker calls you to the stage

1171
01:20:31,000 --> 01:20:33,000
Does that kill me yes, it does

1172
01:20:35,000 --> 01:20:37,000
Wait a minute

1173
01:20:37,000 --> 01:20:40,000
What what what can why can those be exploded?

1174
01:20:46,000 --> 01:20:48,000
Cheeky very clever

1175
01:20:52,000 --> 01:20:54,000
Bob Barker is dead

1176
01:20:56,000 --> 01:20:59,000
Well, who's the new guy Drew Carey right?

1177
01:21:01,000 --> 01:21:03,000
That was pretty easy

1178
01:21:08,000 --> 01:21:15,000
He's got a I get it I thought I got it they both explode you need to drop him

1179
01:21:18,000 --> 01:21:20,000
See ya

1180
01:21:21,000 --> 01:21:24,000
This is it last level last level

1181
01:21:51,000 --> 01:21:53,000
I

1182
01:21:56,000 --> 01:22:03,000
Gotta take the giant Furby and jump with the giant Furby and then bounce again and get him to get the coins

1183
01:22:07,000 --> 01:22:10,000
Right those are the last boss

1184
01:22:15,000 --> 01:22:19,000
So what makes him jump this

1185
01:22:21,000 --> 01:22:25,000
So how does he get the coins?

1186
01:22:39,000 --> 01:22:42,000
I kind of had the right idea can I blow him up?

1187
01:22:51,000 --> 01:22:53,000
Oh

1188
01:23:07,000 --> 01:23:14,000
Explode him into the coins will he actually yeah, it doesn't he doesn't seem to get hit by the explosive to go up

1189
01:23:15,000 --> 01:23:17,000
We're gonna restart it

1190
01:23:22,000 --> 01:23:28,000
Now why does that matter having them go up that high there has to be a reason for that

1191
01:23:32,000 --> 01:23:34,000
I gotta wait till he go

1192
01:23:35,000 --> 01:23:41,000
You don't touch the coins you didn't touch the coins you work so all over those coins

1193
01:23:45,000 --> 01:23:48,000
Now I'm just getting sloppy. I don't even know what I'm being sloppy on be honest

1194
01:23:49,000 --> 01:23:51,000
There we go

1195
01:23:52,000 --> 01:23:56,000
Letting gentleman we have beat the game because yeah

1196
01:23:58,000 --> 01:24:01,000
That should be it right unless there's a super secret level

1197
01:24:03,000 --> 01:24:05,000
This is a super secret level super secret

1198
01:24:10,000 --> 01:24:12,000
Oh man

1199
01:24:12,000 --> 01:24:19,000
Too many things to have to think about at the same time

1200
01:24:20,000 --> 01:24:24,000
Because I can get kid wait wait wait wait I need to be can I get hit by any of these?

1201
01:24:26,000 --> 01:24:29,000
No, so I was freaking out for no reason just put him all the way over here

1202
01:24:31,000 --> 01:24:33,000
Bring down a guy

1203
01:24:33,000 --> 01:24:38,000
And now we just slowly inch our way over well, we just screw it all up that works too

1204
01:24:39,000 --> 01:24:42,000
Start it over just start off because then I can get a good read on it

1205
01:24:45,000 --> 01:24:47,000
Don't fall off I'm falling off

1206
01:24:47,000 --> 01:24:48,000
Shit

1207
01:24:48,000 --> 01:24:52,000
Shit shit shit shit shit shit how far can I go I can that's how far I can go

1208
01:24:52,000 --> 01:24:54,000
Yeah

1209
01:25:13,000 --> 01:25:15,000
I'm perfectly timing these to get hit by the fireballs

1210
01:25:16,000 --> 01:25:18,000
Oh

1211
01:25:19,000 --> 01:25:22,000
Man this one is not easy

1212
01:25:30,000 --> 01:25:34,000
This sucks this sucks so bad sucks

1213
01:25:40,000 --> 01:25:43,000
Thankfully new best

1214
01:25:46,000 --> 01:25:48,000
Another one

1215
01:25:57,000 --> 01:25:59,000
That was easier than the last one

1216
01:26:02,000 --> 01:26:04,000
Tell me more of these other

1217
01:26:09,000 --> 01:26:15,000
Oh no no no no no no no no no no no no no I already know you have to dodge him with this big fat

1218
01:26:15,000 --> 01:26:17,000
Son of a bitch you think I'm gonna be able to do this I

1219
01:26:19,000 --> 01:26:24,000
Just have to focus on the guy in the lower right eventually the bomb's gonna drop and I can blow it up

1220
01:26:25,000 --> 01:26:29,000
Come on there was a you freeze look it ready. I'm tapping jump right now

1221
01:26:29,000 --> 01:26:31,000
There's a point where you cannot move

1222
01:26:39,000 --> 01:26:44,000
I can pee I gotta pee I gotta go ma I gotta go mom

1223
01:26:45,000 --> 01:26:47,000
Yeah

1224
01:26:52,000 --> 01:26:54,000
That's so annoying

1225
01:26:55,000 --> 01:26:57,000
And there's a point where I have to bring him to the right too

1226
01:27:05,000 --> 01:27:07,000
Damn it

1227
01:27:11,000 --> 01:27:13,000
Not really sure a good place to be standing

1228
01:27:15,000 --> 01:27:25,000
Just take it slow only only three more times

1229
01:27:33,000 --> 01:27:35,000
No, I can get him right there

1230
01:27:40,000 --> 01:27:42,000
I'm getting too close

1231
01:27:46,000 --> 01:27:48,000

01:27:51,000 --> 01:27:53,000

01:31:16,000 --> 01:31:18,000
Kill the plumber before the timer runs out on level 23

1278
01:31:19,000 --> 01:31:21,000
These are like achievements. That's cool

1279
01:31:25,000 --> 01:31:27,000
It might be worth trying okay, I'm gonna pee

1280
01:31:28,000 --> 01:31:32,000
So those of you that need to pee go pee and then we're gonna I just to see what this even is

1281
01:31:33,000 --> 01:31:37,000
I'm gonna uh try to get three stars on a few more levels so I can

1282
01:31:38,000 --> 01:31:40,000
Potentially unlock that whatever that held that is

1283
01:31:42,000 --> 01:31:44,000
So I'll be back in like

1284
01:31:44,000 --> 01:31:46,000
I don't know a couple minutes how long does it take to pee

1285
01:32:02,000 --> 01:32:05,000
You

1286
01:32:32,000 --> 01:32:35,000
You

1287
01:33:02,000 --> 01:33:05,000
You

1288
01:33:32,000 --> 01:33:34,000
You

1289
01:33:55,000 --> 01:33:57,000
You know

1290
01:34:03,000 --> 01:34:05,000
Oh

1291
01:34:09,000 --> 01:34:12,000
You sitting on I'm not so much sitting on the toilet

1292
01:34:13,000 --> 01:34:18,000
That was like a 60 second piss you guys have never had one of those before

1293
01:34:19,000 --> 01:34:22,000
Oh, you tell me no you'll lie in

1294
01:34:24,000 --> 01:34:26,000
All right, this one I one star. What did I do wrong here?

1295
01:34:30,000 --> 01:34:32,000
Yeah, I couldn't figure this one out

1296
01:34:33,000 --> 01:34:35,000
This is it I can't get up there

1297
01:34:39,000 --> 01:34:42,000
Unless I'm missing something which I don't think I am how am I supposed to get up there

1298
01:34:45,000 --> 01:34:47,000
How do you not get one star on this level

1299
01:34:56,000 --> 01:34:58,000
Oh, Joe

1300
01:35:03,000 --> 01:35:08,000
Oh, they don't move thing right yeah, okay. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

1301
01:35:11,000 --> 01:35:14,000
That's but that's before I like remember you could even do that

1302
01:35:16,000 --> 01:35:18,000
Okay, let's

1303
01:35:19,000 --> 01:35:21,000
Let's this one

1304
01:35:22,000 --> 01:35:24,000
Oh

1305
01:35:29,000 --> 01:35:30,000
There we go

1306
01:35:30,000 --> 01:35:34,000
So that is all of them completed on this as three stars I

1307
01:35:35,000 --> 01:35:38,000
Still need 12 more

1308
01:35:41,000 --> 01:35:43,000
All right

1309
01:35:52,000 --> 01:35:57,000
Now he does he move I wonder if he moves

1310
01:35:59,000 --> 01:36:04,000
No, I guess got up. Oh, he does move he does move. Okay. That's an odd timing

1311
01:36:08,000 --> 01:36:13,000
One two three four five six

1312
01:36:14,000 --> 01:36:21,000
So just six seconds how long does this take one two three okay, so at three seconds I need to throw it

1313
01:36:22,000 --> 01:36:24,000
one

1314
01:36:24,000 --> 01:36:26,000
two

1315
01:36:26,000 --> 01:36:29,000
five no what at four seconds one two

1316
01:36:30,000 --> 01:36:34,000
three four five six one

1317
01:36:35,000 --> 01:36:40,000
two three four five six one

1318
01:36:44,000 --> 01:36:46,000
two

1319
01:36:46,000 --> 01:36:48,000
one two

1320
01:36:48,000 --> 01:36:50,000
three four

1321
01:36:50,000 --> 01:36:52,000
five six

1322
01:36:52,000 --> 01:36:57,000
What the fuck one two three four five

1323
01:37:00,000 --> 01:37:02,000
Thankfully

1324
01:37:02,000 --> 01:37:04,000
I'm not as dumb as I look

1325
01:37:05,000 --> 01:37:07,000
away dumber

1326
01:37:14,000 --> 01:37:18,000
Okay, so that's what you got to do wait and then throw it right in this place

1327
01:37:22,000 --> 01:37:26,000
That's not cool, so I can move after the second one

1328
01:37:30,000 --> 01:37:32,000
Shit, that's hard that is hard

1329
01:37:44,000 --> 01:37:51,000
Actually, that would that would be it one two three four five

1330
01:37:58,000 --> 01:38:00,000
This one was atrocious why

1331
01:38:02,000 --> 01:38:05,000
See move again, I think he's going to do the same thing

1332
01:38:06,000 --> 01:38:08,000
That

1333
01:38:09,000 --> 01:38:15,000
Come on now that was what we like to call in this industry a real stinker

1334
01:38:26,000 --> 01:38:28,000
Way too late

1335
01:38:29,000 --> 01:38:31,000
Oh

1336
01:38:34,000 --> 01:38:36,000
That's what we like to call a real stinker

1337
01:38:41,000 --> 01:38:43,000
Any more to any eight more

1338
01:38:52,000 --> 01:38:54,000
What was wrong with this one

1339
01:38:54,000 --> 01:38:57,000
I just don't know if the move I was moving away too much

1340
01:39:01,000 --> 01:39:03,000
Okay, so I thought I could get through the whole thing

1341
01:39:04,000 --> 01:39:07,000
The very last second right when this one comes all the way over is when you have to start moving

1342
01:39:10,000 --> 01:39:12,000
And there it is

1343
01:39:19,000 --> 01:39:21,000
Swan 21

1344
01:39:24,000 --> 01:39:26,000
It's

1345
01:39:26,000 --> 01:39:28,000
Extremely easy

1346
01:39:29,000 --> 01:39:32,000
Not much more to go and he five more

1347
01:39:33,000 --> 01:39:38,000
31 32 33 34 35 36 so I have to get you just have to three start every single level

1348
01:39:42,000 --> 01:39:44,000
Shit, I don't know this is gonna be tough

1349
01:39:47,000 --> 01:39:49,000
Considering that I need to get this like perfect

1350
01:39:54,000 --> 01:39:56,000
So it needs to be right

1351
01:39:57,000 --> 01:40:01,000
Right now it didn't do it right

1352
01:40:07,000 --> 01:40:10,000
Actually still might really get three if I can make it all the way down here

1353
01:40:24,000 --> 01:40:26,000
Oh

1354
01:40:43,000 --> 01:40:45,000
It's it

1355
01:40:54,000 --> 01:40:57,000
I don't I don't know if I

1356
01:41:16,000 --> 01:41:18,000
Just got to get over there

1357
01:41:24,000 --> 01:41:26,000
I

1358
01:41:28,000 --> 01:41:30,000
How do I follow them all the way down I can't

1359
01:41:32,000 --> 01:41:34,000
