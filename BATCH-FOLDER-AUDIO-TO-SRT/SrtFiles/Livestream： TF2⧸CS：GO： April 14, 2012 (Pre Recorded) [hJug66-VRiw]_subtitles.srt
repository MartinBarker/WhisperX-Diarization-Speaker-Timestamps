00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,000
Hi!

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:10,000
Hello, everyone. German 985 here.

3
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:13,000
Hello, everyone. German 985.

4
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:16,000
Oh, well, you can't lie to him like that.

5
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:19,000
What's up, guys?

6
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:22,000
Did anyone believe it?

7
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:25,000
No one's even here to hear it, so.

8
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:28,000
Yeah, there are like 15-20 people already here.

9
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:31,000
Oh, you're on Twitch, mother.

10
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:34,000
I am on the Twitch-itch.

11
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:37,000
Anyways, happy Saturday.

12
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:40,000
Happy Sunday if you're from a different country.

13
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:46,000
And let me show this out to people's.

14
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:49,000
Actually, I got to write, uh, app.

15
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:51,000
And they'll see.

16
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:55,000
Oh, come on.

17
00:00:55,000 --> 00:01:02,000
Well, how come I can't bring up Brett, as I can app mentioned?

18
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:04,000
Maybe he blew up his Twitter.

19
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:07,000
MLC stealth.

20
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:10,000
Like, I'm not even doing you either.

21
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:13,000
What's going on here, Twitter?

22
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:15,000
Twitter, what is going on?

23
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:18,000
Why are you being like this?

24
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:21,000
I'm going to tweet, too.

25
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:24,000
You could just retweet what I tweet.

26
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:27,000
You can all tweet.

27
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:28,000
You can pick your dog.

28
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:30,000
You can tweet, I tweet, but you can't.

29
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:33,000
We all tweet for germistry.

30
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:35,000
And there we go.

31
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:38,000
With at MLs.

32
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:40,000
Okay, why that was weird.

33
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:47,000
I don't know why it didn't work before.

34
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:53,000
I wonder who that is.

35
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:55,000
And tweet.

36
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:56,000
No, no, no, tweet.

37
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:57,000
Come to it yet.

38
00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:00,000
Because I need to, uh, write it.

39
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:01,000
I already tweeted.

40
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:02,000
Oh, no, it is.

41
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:05,000
Oh, no, no, no, I was talking to myself, not to you.

42
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:08,000
Like, as I was telling myself, because I was going to hit the Twitter button.

43
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:10,000
And I didn't even put like the link.

44
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:14,000
So I was like, no, no.

45
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:16,000
It has been Twittered.

46
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:19,000
And yes, it has.

47
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:20,000
And there's Twitter.

48
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:24,000
Now go to YouTube.

49
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:29,000
And post that.

50
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:35,000
And then get out of there, because it's not necessary.

51
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:37,000
And set it stream.

52
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:41,000
Which means you're going to find, okay.

53
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:46,000
Good evening.

54
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:48,000
I'm going to play some team fortress too.

55
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:53,000
And then if you guys don't know, they just put out a huge, huge CS go update.

56
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:58,000
So that should be interesting to check out for sure.

57
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:04,000
It's probably one of the big, they've added like five maps.

58
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:07,000
I would love to express my enthusiasm for that.

59
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:09,000
But the last.

60
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:10,000
I cannot.

61
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:11,000
You don't have it.

62
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:12,000
I don't have it.

63
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:15,000
No.

64
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:18,000
I'm going to go out.

65
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:20,000
Yeah.

66
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:23,000
I think they're going to release us coming soon.

67
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:26,000
I think it's coming soon.

68
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:28,000
Otherwise did that.

69
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:32,000
The update today was pretty huge.

70
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:37,000
You know valve, though, it's going to be months, probably.

71
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:39,000
Yeah, yeah, true.

72
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:41,000
Very true.

73
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:42,000
Good evening, everyone.

74
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:44,000
I'll give that a saying.

75
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:49,000
There are a number of teams that collected one guy off the board.

76
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:51,000
I just have six of those two players who can play.

77
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:59,000
That one one is where you go tomorrow and talking to a themes.

78
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:00,000
Remember is that.

79
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:03,000
It's not that I don't really know what to paint.

80
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:07,000
evaluate exactly.

81
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:09,000
One selectey pitch.

82
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:10,000
See.

83
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:13,000
So throw monthly retirement to five.

84
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:18,000
Perfect timing sir. Thank you. I was waiting for the right moment to enter.

85
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:23,000
I don't know, it's pretty good. No, I was watching clips from the Olin

86
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:31,000
de generis show. Why are you doing that? She's funny. Sorry I'm late. You're supposed to be in the stream.

87
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:40,000
Now let's get into this server. Let's try to find a 32. Here we go. Seathing bad lands.

88
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:50,000
I don't know. I want to do CPU bad lands. This is 28. That's two fours trading. Oh, here we go.

89
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:56,000
This is two out of 24. All right, you guys ready? Not quite yet. Oh, you better hurry up. I'm

90
00:04:56,000 --> 00:05:01,000
launching it. It's already on that screen. It's already on screen. I've already got Xbox connected.

91
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:07,000
My console ready to go. Wait a couple seconds. Oh, by the way, if you guys made,

92
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:12,000
everyone knows who Stealth is, but some people may not know who you are. Alex got to give an introduction.

93
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:19,000
Hey guys, my name is italics and I make YouTube videos. And my channel name is gamers descent,

94
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:25,000
which you may know me by instead of italics. That is where I hail from. Yeah, you come from the

95
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:32,000
the mountain top of gamers descent. What time is it right now? It is 15 after six if people

96
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:37,000
that were just saying that. All right, I'm ready. What we're going to say is Alex before I cut you off?

97
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:44,000
I don't. I don't know. I guess to further introduce myself, I'm a machinima realm director. So,

98
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:51,000
I'm on the other side of the chasm between the two machinima mountains. I come in peace.

99
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:58,000
Here we go. People have already started joining. Let's do it. 68.177.101.

100
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:01,000
.44.

101
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:05,000
Colin 27016. You better go.

102
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:09,000
Oh, that confused me. It has 16. I've pressed six first.

103
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:17,000
Well, you better get in there. Those teen numbers always confuse me.

104
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:22,000
Hey, I think so it still says I'm playing. I didn't even update the dashboard either.

105
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:26,000
I think the good thing is still correct. I'll change it right now.

106
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:30,000
Put TF2 Moa hunting.

107
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:40,000
TF2 Moa hunting. All you're going to do is get 25 kills in a row. That's very difficult to do in this

108
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:45,000
game. That is not an easy thing to do in team fortress to get more than more than I'd say more than

109
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:51,000
15 kills in a row. 10 kills in a row is even like a pretty big field strength. The only one who could

110
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:58,000
do it is a engineer. How heavy to have you can get a lot of kill. Engineer if nobody is like smart

111
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:10,000
and going dimmer manner. Over. Middic. I went on zero red team. How does the game audio? Let's take a look.

112
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:15,000
How's the game audio guys? Good.

113
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:21,000
Check it good. I cannot tell. Are you going to tell them what's your name is?

114
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:28,000
I think people will probably figure it out by now. Dic Simmons the dump champion.

115
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:33,000
Oh, where's this scout going?

116
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:41,000
It's pretty nice player gun dude. Oh, I thought it was you.

117
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:45,000
Oh, watch it. Watch it. Look up still.

118
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:51,000
Oh, I forgot fire kills me.

119
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:56,000
It's going up pretty well here. What do I have for a melee right now?

120
00:07:56,000 --> 00:08:02,000
Actually, I got the postal pommel there. Let's try and get some postal pommel there kills.

121
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:07,000
Yeah, you know, you're not spying. I need a medic.

122
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:12,000
Oh, yeah, we did it game over.

123
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:15,000
We did it job team.

124
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:21,000
So we can do it again. Very cool.

125
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:26,000
Oh, we changed. I wanted to play on upward too.

126
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:28,000
Oh, I love upward. I love it too.

127
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:33,000
Upward is one of my favorites. Upward.

128
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:42,000
Oh, what do we know? My most kills is only 25 as a sniper.

129
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:45,000
I've only gotten one moe lab. I have no idea. Oh, I thought it mountain good.

130
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:49,000
I love Thunderbomb. I like the first two stages. Thunder mountain.

131
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:55,000
Germa, can I be has in a hug? If you ask him for a hug, get ready.

132
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:59,000
Internet hug. There we are. He be has him in your hug.

133
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:01,000
Here we go. He has been in.

134
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:03,000
Here comes the internet hug.

135
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:09,000
You just received the internet hug. Look worth 15 dollars.

136
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:13,000
You got hugs. That's actually pretty good.

137
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:18,000
You've got mail. Oh, I have a new item. Oh, I got a new item.

138
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:20,000
I'm giving away my backpack. I finally got some new stuff.

139
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:27,000
Oh, why am I even running? Waiting for players. What are we going?

140
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:30,000
You guys, no one's got to give me stuff.

141
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:35,000
I mean, items are one thing. I have a nice plan.

142
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:39,000
As you probably saw in my latest video, if you haven't, I'm going to do a crate unboxing video.

143
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:46,000
Whatever I get in those crates, if I get an unusual or something, it's going to be given away.

144
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:50,000
Any unusual I get in the boxes is going to be given away.

145
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:52,000
And if I get strangers, they're mine. I'm keeping them.

146
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:58,000
Now we got it. We got a full server.

147
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:02,000
I will prop the 24.

148
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:05,000
Yeah, there's five spectators.

149
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:08,000
Make sure some people are kind of stuck in the spectator right now.

150
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:14,000
But the unboxing video will probably be next week, how to zoom.

151
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:16,000
I do you share.

152
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:20,000
Take seven's the dump champion.

153
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:23,000
Yeah, that's me. Dixim is the dump champion.

154
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:24,000
Wait, did you put end quotes on that?

155
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:29,000
I think this is the parrots parentheses.

156
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:30,000
It's all I know.

157
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:34,000
It should be on this stream.

158
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:35,000
I don't think so.

159
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:38,000
I've been wrong before though.

160
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:41,000
All right, I close my door there.

161
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:43,000
Should be is not on this stream.

162
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:46,000
No, not in the chat anyway.

163
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:47,000
No, I'm not that I can see.

164
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:48,000
High five.

165
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:49,000
Bank.

166
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:50,000
All right.

167
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:54,000
Can I just kill somebody already?

168
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:55,000
We got away.

169
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:56,000
This is the end of time, man.

170
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:58,000
I want to blow them underneath the fence.

171
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:02,000
Well, I ever played Dona War II.

172
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:04,000
Oh, man, I was a huge Dona War one fan.

173
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:06,000
I don't really like what they did with Dona War II.

174
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:07,000
I'm not going to lie.

175
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:09,000
Wasn't a big Dona War II person.

176
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:11,000
Oh my god.

177
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:14,000
Oh, I forgot another shotgun.

178
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:18,000
Still pretty good.

179
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:18,000
Oh, thanks.

180
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:21,000
Covered in the G. I've brought it.

181
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:23,000
I'm going to puke as I get.

182
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:25,000
Deradi makes me puke.

183
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:27,000
Oh my god.

184
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:28,000
Deradi get out of here.

185
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:30,000
Conqueror.

186
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:31,000
Contrary.

187
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:35,000
I can't believe how many no points I got right there.

188
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:37,000
Oh no, no, no, damn it.

189
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:39,000
I thought I had more rockets loaded.

190
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:40,000
SHIT.

191
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:41,000
What does that spell shoot?

192
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:44,000
Gosh darn it.

193
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:45,000
Oh, good.

194
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:47,000
That's what that spells.

195
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:51,000
Boom, boom, boom.

196
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:52,000
Who am I streaming with?

197
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:54,000
MLC stealth and italics.

198
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:56,000
Two pros.

199
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:00,000
We play games.

200
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:02,000
Sometimes we are special.

201
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:04,000
Sometimes we play video games.

202
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:06,000
Oh, occasionally.

203
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:08,000
Sometimes we laugh.

204
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:09,000
Sometimes we cry.

205
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:12,000
Sometimes we share valuable moments together

206
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:13,000
that make us better.

207
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:14,000
Oh, he's going to get away.

208
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:17,000
I refuse to let him get away.

209
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:18,000
He's going to get behind everybody.

210
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:21,000
He's going to get behind us all.

211
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:22,000
I think he already is.

212
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:23,000
Oh, he's gone.

213
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:25,000
What?

214
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:27,000
Nine health and I'm jumping off of high surfaces.

215
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:30,000
Oh, how do I survive?

216
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:31,000
Give me that health.

217
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:37,000
Can you donate an unusual um?

218
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:39,000
I thought you were about to say can you dig at the sucker?

219
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:42,000
I would rather you hang onto that.

220
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:43,000
I don't need anything.

221
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:44,000
You know, you know, you've got to get new stuff.

222
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:45,000
Booker tea.

223
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:48,000
Best surely an unusual because an unusual is worth a lot

224
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:51,000
and I don't want to take stuff like that from people so.

225
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:57,000
Oh, did I make it?

226
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:58,000
Oh, my god.

227
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:00,000
That was a good shot.

228
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:03,000
That guy caught me right when I was coming down.

229
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:11,000
Oh, oh.

230
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:13,000
I got to take off the conqueror.

231
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:16,000
Conqueror is.

232
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:17,000
Oh, man.

233
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:20,000
I'm not feeling the conqueror.

234
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:21,000
Not right now.

235
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:23,000
Oh, damn.

236
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:28,000
That was in the face.

237
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:36,000
What's it?

238
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:37,000
I'm taking this off.

239
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:38,000
I'm going to put on.

240
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:40,000
What am I going to put on?

241
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:42,000
I'm going to put on the shotgun.

242
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:45,000
The strange shotgun I still have to give these away.

243
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:47,000
I have given my third.

244
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:49,000
I've given 33% of the back back away so far.

245
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:52,000
Two more people I have to get in contact with.

246
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:55,000
And then after that, it is start all over again.

247
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:00,000
Oh, guys.

248
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:02,000
All right, I'm going medic.

249
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:08,000
Yeah, we could use, uh, we only got one.

250
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:09,000
Oh, actually, you are the one.

251
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:12,000
Actually, there's two, I think.

252
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:13,000
Are he's medicing?

253
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:14,000
Oh, wait, y'all.

254
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:15,000
Okay, okay, I got to see the two.

255
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:19,000
So, which one is German?

256
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:25,000
I swear, it's not dick sevens, the dumb champion.

257
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:27,000
That is a spy.

258
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:30,000
Oh, no.

259
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:34,000
If I see, oh, bye.

260
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:35,000
Is it, oh, bye, charge?

261
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:41,000
Well, classes, are you guys playing us right now?

262
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:41,000
I'm soldier.

263
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:42,000
Oh, no.

264
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:45,000
Oh, so little hell.

265
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:46,000
I am so much.

266
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:51,000
One of my video settings on here, I'll show you.

267
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:56,000
Video 1280 by 720, because I'm running in a window right now.

268
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:57,000
I'm going to be able to stream it.

269
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:02,000
But I play on high, high, high, simple, medium, disabled, color correction,

270
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:04,000
and then all these other things.

271
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:07,000
I don't play with anti-aliasing on.

272
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:11,000
I feel like the amount of resources it takes to the amount of gain you get

273
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:14,000
is not really that noticeable at least in my opinion.

274
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:16,000
Is it at least for a game like this?

275
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:20,000
Oh, I'm worried.

276
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:22,000
Thank you for putting me out of fire, Tyro.

277
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:24,000
For me, I always play with B-Sync.

278
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:25,000
Oh, my god.

279
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:26,000
Damn.

280
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:26,000
Always.

281
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:27,000
I'm changing.

282
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:28,000
I'm changing to engineer.

283
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:38,000
Do I play any commonly hated games?

284
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:39,000
Oh, backstab, turn around, spy.

285
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:42,000
Do you guys play any commonly hated games?

286
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:43,000
These outside our door.

287
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:47,000
Any commonly hated games?

288
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:48,000
I call it duty.

289
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:49,000
What would fall under that?

290
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:53,000
Answer is yes.

291
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:56,000
Still does play commonly hated games.

292
00:15:57,000 --> 00:15:57,000
Call it duty.

293
00:15:57,000 --> 00:16:01,000
But like actually hated, like, literally bad games, I don't know.

294
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:07,000
Yeah, I don't think I play any really hated games.

295
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:12,000
Oh, there's the sniper again.

296
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:14,000
We still got a level one up.

297
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:17,000
Oh, I think I got about a score.

298
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:17,000
Oh, come on.

299
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:19,000
Is this guy hacking?

300
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:21,000
Come on, let me see.

301
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:25,000
I see a spy on their team running around in his taunts.

302
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:29,000
And he looks like a wax figure just moving around, skating around.

303
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:32,000
It's probably a glitch or something.

304
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:33,000
I don't know.

305
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:34,000
Yeah, I saw that earlier too.

306
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:35,000
I think it is just a glitch.

307
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:39,000
But even when he was disguised, it was just walking around.

308
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:41,000
Not moving.

309
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:45,000
Like arms in the air.

310
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:48,000
Oh, I got a change this.

311
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:50,000
I don't get a change that one.

312
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:50,000
I don't.

313
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:52,000
You got to change it.

314
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:54,000
Oh, I got to hurry the hell up.

315
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:55,000
Oh, boy.

316
00:16:57,000 --> 00:16:57,000
Do you engineer?

317
00:16:57,000 --> 00:16:59,000
I was a second behind.

318
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:01,000
I threw my games off, thrown off now.

319
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:03,000
What is this?

320
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:03,000
Like an RTS?

321
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:05,000
I've got to catch up.

322
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:06,000
Yeah.

323
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:10,000
My actions permitted is only a hundred.

324
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:11,000
Let's go.

325
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:12,000
Let's go.

326
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:16,000
What's your hood?

327
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:19,000
What's the best scattergun for the scout?

328
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:19,000
They're all good.

329
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:22,000
It depends on how you play stylons.

330
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:26,000
Mid-range, too long-range, use the shortstop.

331
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:30,000
Close-range, meat shots, force nature, and everything else kind of in between.

332
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:33,000
The regular scatterguns probably the best.

333
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:34,000
At least that's kind of how I see it.

334
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:35,000
I like that one the best.

335
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:37,000
No, I've got to go over here.

336
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:37,000
What am I doing?

337
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:38,000
Oh, god.

338
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:39,000
I've already spurred this off.

339
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:42,000
And I salvage this is the real question.

340
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:44,000
That's the real question.

341
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:45,000
Can I salvage this?

342
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:48,000
Oh, what am I doing?

343
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:50,000
I don't know where I want to put it.

344
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:51,000
I don't know what I want to do.

345
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:52,000
I'm so torn right now.

346
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:55,000
Because this guy's right here now.

347
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:55,000
I'm putting it right here.

348
00:17:57,000 --> 00:17:58,000
The limb of the limb of the...

349
00:17:58,000 --> 00:17:59,000
I was that was so torn.

350
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:00,000
My brain put it on here.

351
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:01,000
I know what I was just doing right here.

352
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:05,000
Oh, lord.

353
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:08,000
Oh, this is going down in two seconds.

354
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:12,000
I have absolutely...

355
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:12,000
Oh, lag.

356
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:13,000
Oh, yeah, I got that too.

357
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:15,000
Super lag.

358
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:20,000
Is that the real emulsiness stealth?

359
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:21,000
I hope so.

360
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:21,000
Yep.

361
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:23,000
Oh, I'm getting a lot of lag.

362
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:27,000
Thank you, Engineer, for helping me build this.

363
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:28,000
Appreciate it.

364
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:33,000
And let's reload.

365
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:36,000
Is that the real emulsiness stealth?

366
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:36,000
Oh, yeah.

367
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:43,000
All right, I got some catching up to doing points.

368
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:44,000
This is kind of getting embarrassing.

369
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:46,000
Oh, my gosh.

370
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:46,000
Here comes...

371
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:48,000
Oh, there goes the dispenser.

372
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:49,000
Oh, my God.

373
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:50,000
Oh, he's up top.

374
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:52,000
Oh.

375
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:55,000
That just ruined my life.

376
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:55,000
Oh, there's that lag in.

377
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:56,000
Unmoving.

378
00:18:57,000 --> 00:18:58,000
Yeah, I got him.

379
00:18:58,000 --> 00:18:59,000
Or maybe you deadwing too, Nost.

380
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:00,000
We're going this.

381
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:09,000
I like this better.

382
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:12,000
Because I don't feel as bad when I lose all my stuff.

383
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:14,000
Oh, spy.

384
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:15,000
Doing his thing.

385
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:17,000
I think that...

386
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:18,000
Oh, my word.

387
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:20,000
He is doing his thing, isn't he?

388
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:23,000
Get away, Romani.

389
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:24,000
He's not dead.

390
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:26,000
Oh, he is not dead.

391
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:27,000
I didn't get the...

392
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:31,000
I'm going to duel with him right now.

393
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:33,000
Oh, yeah.

394
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:35,000
Yeah, so I didn't get the...

395
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:36,000
I don't know, everyone.

396
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:38,000
Find him on the cart.

397
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:40,000
Shit.

398
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:43,000
Oh, my God.

399
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:46,000
You're all right, Doc.

400
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:49,000
Oh, run away.

401
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:51,000
I want it up here.

402
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:53,000
They're about to get to the point.

403
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:56,000
They almost say...

404
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:57,000
Oh, crap thing.

405
00:19:57,000 --> 00:19:58,000
Oh, no, no, no, where's he?

406
00:19:58,000 --> 00:19:59,000
Oh, no.

407
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:00,000
Give it help.

408
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:02,000
Oh, my God, Roy.

409
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:05,000
Oh, this guy's still going to get me.

410
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:09,000
Oh, no.

411
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:12,000
Oh, I can't believe I'm still alive.

412
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:17,000
Additional.

413
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:17,000
Oh, they got it.

414
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:19,000
No, I was dead.

415
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:20,000
I was toast right here.

416
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:24,000
I was toast.

417
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:26,000
Oh, I love butter toast.

418
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:29,000
What's name tag?

419
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:31,000
I think the chat...

420
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:32,000
The chat frees for anybody else.

421
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:34,000
I think the chat is for us for me.

422
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:35,000
Somebody has found a name tag.

423
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:35,000
What's that mean?

424
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:39,000
I don't think the chat froze.

425
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:42,000
No, I was looking at it and I was like, wait, no, nothing.

426
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:45,000
They're going to...

427
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:47,000
They got a heavy medic right here.

428
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:47,000
Get rid of that medic.

429
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:50,000
Oh, my God.

430
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:56,000
When all of us fails, just duck and cover.

431
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:59,000
Well, after this fry, I didn't know you found that stuff though.

432
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:01,000
Didn't know you found the name tags.

433
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:02,000
I thought you had a biome.

434
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:03,000
You can find it.

435
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:04,000
No, I think.

436
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:05,000
You can find it.

437
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:08,000
Frazier, you can find it.

438
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:09,000
There's spies like surfing around in the

439
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:10,000
our base.

440
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:12,000
There's two spies, I think sitting outside our doors.

441
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:14,000
Oh, God, he's over here.

442
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:16,000
No, wait, that's not even mine.

443
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:18,000
That's not my century.

444
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:20,000
I'm really losing it here, guys.

445
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:22,000
My brain can't even handle what I'm doing.

446
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:25,000
Oh, get out of my way.

447
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:26,000
Okay.

448
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:29,000
No, no, no.

449
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:31,000
I just barely saved that.

450
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:36,000
So many people.

451
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:37,000
So much death.

452
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:38,000
Trying to get this dispenser up.

453
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:39,000
Oh, I was primed.

454
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:40,000
I know you're not dead.

455
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:42,000
He could.

456
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:46,000
Wow.

457
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:47,000
Oh, okay.

458
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:47,000
Okay.

459
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:48,000
I'm going out there.

460
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:50,000
Someone's going to get toasted out there.

461
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:53,000
Oh, it's probably going to be me.

462
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:53,000
Is that you, Dick?

463
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:56,000
Was that you?

464
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:57,000
Is it just who walked right next to me?

465
00:21:57,000 --> 00:21:58,000
Was that the spy?

466
00:21:58,000 --> 00:21:58,000
Is that you, Richard?

467
00:21:58,000 --> 00:21:59,000
Yeah, that's me.

468
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:02,000
Hello.

469
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:04,000
What are you doing, Richard?

470
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:04,000
Yeah.

471
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:08,000
Oh, it gets about it.

472
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:09,000
Oh, yeah.

473
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:12,000
I went from like last place, like fourth place in one line.

474
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:13,000
Oh, my God.

475
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:15,000
What's ringing out?

476
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:16,000
Oh, that's a.

477
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:18,000
I bet this is fun.

478
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:19,000
I am.

479
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:19,000
Wow.

480
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:20,000
Hi.

481
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:21,000
What happened?

482
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:22,000
Hold on, hold on.

483
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:22,000
That's gonna be cool.

484
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:23,000
It's gonna be cool.

485
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:24,000
Sorry, let's talk to my man.

486
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:26,000
I'm going to get back to that.

487
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:27,000
That's a spy.

488
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:27,000
No.

489
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:35,000
Oh, well, shoot.

490
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:39,000
God.

491
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:40,000
Oh, there we go.

492
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:41,000
This is what I'm talking about.

493
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:42,000
Ow.

494
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:43,000
What the fuck?

495
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:44,000
I'm with a scoreboard, boys.

496
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:49,000
I have faith in you, Jerma.

497
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:51,000
I wonder if I will play you think, uh,

498
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:53,000
I read.

499
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:54,000
I wonder if you get nice to.

500
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:55,000
What the hell was that?

501
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:57,000
What the hell was that?

502
00:22:58,000 --> 00:23:00,000
Just give a nice gun in place when at the end of that hallway right there.

503
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:02,000
Yeah, I'm trying to, I can turn it.

504
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:04,000
Did I keep destroyed it?

505
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:07,000
I got some people that know what they're doing.

506
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:12,000
I probably will play zombie fortress at some point.

507
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:13,000
Probably not tonight though.

508
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:14,000
What?

509
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:15,000
Zombie fortress.

510
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:17,000
I'm just going in for punches.

511
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:18,000
I don't even care.

512
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:20,000
Room my knocking out with one punch.

513
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:22,000
You'll get knocked out.

514
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:22,000
Run up.

515
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:24,000
Oh, come on.

516
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:25,000
Feel the pain.

517
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:28,000
I would have killed them too.

518
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:29,000
Oh, f**k.

519
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:30,000
That's frownless.

520
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:31,000
Like one shot.

521
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:36,000
Uh, just set the next level to where we're going.

522
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:37,000
We're changing server after this anyway.

523
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:37,000
So.

524
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:40,000
All right.

525
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:43,000
Well, that answers that question.

526
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:44,000
We're changing server.

527
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:46,000
Just to keep it one and no, Jerma.

528
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:47,000
What is zombie fortress?

529
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:49,000
I, uh, I don't know.

530
00:23:49,000 --> 00:23:51,000
I think it's like kind of like every,

531
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:52,000
oh my god.

532
00:23:53,000 --> 00:23:56,000
Everybody plays as, oh, I think everyone has melee,

533
00:23:56,000 --> 00:23:58,000
except for a small group of people.

534
00:23:58,000 --> 00:23:59,000
Somebody explain it.

535
00:23:59,000 --> 00:24:02,000
Oh, so it's like infection on Halo.

536
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:03,000
Hey, you're not me.

537
00:24:03,000 --> 00:24:05,000
Or whatever that game mode's called.

538
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:06,000
I think I know what you're talking about.

539
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:10,000
Yeah, it's, it's like, it's kind of like a zombie mode where everyone runs around with melee,

540
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:12,000
except for the small group of people that don't have,

541
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:13,000
did they're like the not zombies.

542
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:17,000
If I'm wrong, somebody please correct me in the chat,

543
00:24:17,000 --> 00:24:19,000
because I know it's something like that though.

544
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:22,000
That's probably right.

545
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:23,000
Somebody said it's like Halo infection.

546
00:24:23,000 --> 00:24:24,000
Watch out for spies.

547
00:24:25,000 --> 00:24:26,000
Oh, they got taken out everything.

548
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:28,000
I got to be a little bit sneakier with these centers.

549
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:30,000
And that's going to blow up the kill me.

550
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:32,000
And that's going to die.

551
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:34,000
I, I, I, I go, I'm going to go.

552
00:24:35,000 --> 00:24:37,000
I'm going to S sounds.

553
00:24:37,000 --> 00:24:38,000
Who you playing as heavy?

554
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:39,000
I am playing as heavy.

555
00:24:41,000 --> 00:24:43,000
See, scout is what I rage quit as.

556
00:24:43,000 --> 00:24:44,000
Five, I like to run around.

557
00:24:45,000 --> 00:24:47,000
I start a scout and then I'm like, okay, I suck.

558
00:24:47,000 --> 00:24:49,000
Moving on to the heavy where I can actually kill people.

559
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:51,000
I like this setup.

560
00:24:51,000 --> 00:24:52,000
I'll stick with this.

561
00:24:58,000 --> 00:25:00,000
Whoa, I heard a backstab.

562
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:01,000
I'm standing in the corner.

563
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:05,000
Oh, God.

564
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:07,000
Oh, he, I don't think he's dead.

565
00:25:07,000 --> 00:25:07,000
Maybe he is.

566
00:25:07,000 --> 00:25:08,000
I don't know.

567
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:09,000
Man, we don't have any engineers do we?

568
00:25:13,000 --> 00:25:16,000
Oh, like, wait, what just happened to me?

569
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:18,000
What just even happened?

570
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:21,000
I got headshot from across the map.

571
00:25:23,000 --> 00:25:24,000
Oh, my God.

572
00:25:25,000 --> 00:25:26,000
Oh, no, I just struck this.

573
00:25:27,000 --> 00:25:28,000
Oh, we're Bethelus.

574
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:29,000
We're Bethelus.

575
00:25:29,000 --> 00:25:29,000
We are.

576
00:25:29,000 --> 00:25:30,000
We're Bethelus.

577
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:32,000
Yeah, there's two spies on the point.

578
00:25:33,000 --> 00:25:33,000
Of the car.

579
00:25:33,000 --> 00:25:34,000
We lost.

580
00:25:35,000 --> 00:25:37,000
Well, do you, what do you guys get like the second spies?

581
00:25:37,000 --> 00:25:39,000
How many spies are on that damn team?

582
00:25:45,000 --> 00:25:46,000
All right, new new server.

583
00:25:47,000 --> 00:25:48,000
Not GG.

584
00:25:49,000 --> 00:25:53,000
New S-E-V-R-V-V-R-V.

585
00:26:01,000 --> 00:26:03,000
Hmm, actually, hold on.

586
00:26:03,000 --> 00:26:05,000
I'm going to, the screen's going to go black for one second

587
00:26:05,000 --> 00:26:10,000
because I'm going to change, then it's changed something real quick.

588
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:13,000
Well, you do that.

589
00:26:13,000 --> 00:26:15,000
I'll be RB for about 10 seconds.

590
00:26:15,000 --> 00:26:17,000
You can see what my parents want.

591
00:26:17,000 --> 00:26:19,000
Well, because for some reason, when I was doing

592
00:26:19,000 --> 00:26:22,000
X-Blit in the game mode, it was lagging my game a lot.

593
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:22,000
I don't know why.

594
00:26:23,000 --> 00:26:25,000
Sometimes I guess it does that.

595
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:30,000
Yeah, are you using like the what?

596
00:26:31,000 --> 00:26:33,000
Screen area or the other one?

597
00:26:33,000 --> 00:26:34,000
I was doing the game source.

598
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:36,000
When the game that was like lagging my game sort of.

599
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:37,000
All right, try screen area.

600
00:26:37,000 --> 00:26:39,000
I just I just did not change it over.

601
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:43,000
X-Blit, you're supposed to be like the release.

602
00:26:45,000 --> 00:26:46,000
All right, let's go to

603
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:49,000
get to meet some folks too.

604
00:26:49,000 --> 00:26:50,000
You're going to the dust fall.

605
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:51,000
Oh no, I got a high tower.

606
00:26:51,000 --> 00:26:54,000
High tower zero out of this is a good one.

607
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:55,000
Hopefully stealth gets back soon.

608
00:26:57,000 --> 00:26:59,000
Otherwise, he's going to be in trouble.

609
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:03,000
To delay for him when we were doing the test streaming,

610
00:27:03,000 --> 00:27:05,000
I was using game source and it was working fine.

611
00:27:05,000 --> 00:27:07,000
So it just seems like on again, off again.

612
00:27:07,000 --> 00:27:08,000
It's hit or miss now.

613
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:11,000
Very hit or miss.

614
00:27:11,000 --> 00:27:12,000
All right, that's all I got still.

615
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:12,000
It's all I got.

616
00:27:13,000 --> 00:27:13,000
That's it.

617
00:27:13,000 --> 00:27:15,000
That's your only, uh,

618
00:27:15,000 --> 00:27:15,000
that's my only delay.

619
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:17,000
All right.

620
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:18,000
Stealth.

621
00:27:19,000 --> 00:27:20,000
Is that hurry up?

622
00:27:21,000 --> 00:27:24,000
Oh, it's so,

623
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:27,000
Joe, my how things going over here today?

624
00:27:27,000 --> 00:27:27,000

625
00:27:27,000 --> 00:27:28,000
I'm from pasting it.

626
00:27:29,000 --> 00:27:31,000
Ready to go video and a stream.

627
00:27:31,000 --> 00:27:33,000
Just ballin like a YouTuber does.

628
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:35,000
Ballin.

629
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:37,000
Straight ballin.

630
00:27:37,000 --> 00:27:38,000
All right, stealth.

631
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:39,000
Really, that's all I got now.

632
00:27:39,000 --> 00:27:40,000
Now we're never man.

633
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:41,000
All right, 68.

634
00:27:41,000 --> 00:27:42,000

635
00:27:43,000 --> 00:27:45,000
Dot 177.

636
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:46,000
Dot 105.

637
00:27:47,000 --> 00:27:49,000
Colin 270.

638
00:27:49,000 --> 00:27:50,000
It's Dean.

639
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:51,000
Sorry, stealth.

640
00:27:51,000 --> 00:27:51,000
You weren't here.

641
00:27:53,000 --> 00:27:54,000
But you missed out.

642
00:27:57,000 --> 00:27:58,000
That's the IP and those of you are wondering.

643
00:28:01,000 --> 00:28:02,000
All right, I have somebody like here.

644
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:03,000
I'm gonna pick up.

645
00:28:03,000 --> 00:28:04,000
Oh, is it?

646
00:28:05,000 --> 00:28:06,000
He's no, he's not making it.

647
00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:09,000
There's no way he makes it.

648
00:28:09,000 --> 00:28:12,000
Oh, hey, hey, there's no way you make it.

649
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:13,000
There's no way you make it.

650
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:16,000
I was gonna say I have some bad news bears.

651
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:19,000
Dinner is ready with my parents.

652
00:28:19,000 --> 00:28:21,000
I was gonna probably go eat that with all my sir.

653
00:28:21,000 --> 00:28:22,000
Dinner is ready with my parents.

654
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:24,000
Well, it only like throw me out as a son.

655

Thanks for coming.

657
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:33,000
Do you have no problem?

658
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:36,000
Oh, I'm gonna miss you, buddy.

659
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:37,000
Make sure you signify to the stream.

660
00:28:37,000 --> 00:28:38,000
Is that gonna miss you?

661
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:39,000
Oh, by stream.

662
00:28:39,000 --> 00:28:39,000
That's true.

663
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:42,000
Thanks for having me.

664
00:28:43,000 --> 00:28:44,000
See you guys later.

665
00:28:45,000 --> 00:28:46,000
All right, I miss you guys.

666
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:48,000
Oh, I'm the host of the call.

667
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:48,000
I'll just meet myself.

668
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:49,000
Oh, are you really?

669
00:28:49,000 --> 00:28:50,000
Yes, sir.

670
00:28:50,000 --> 00:28:51,000
Just mute your uh.

671
00:28:53,000 --> 00:28:56,000
Yeah, now who should have hosted?

672
00:28:56,000 --> 00:28:56,000
Burbey.

673
00:28:57,000 --> 00:28:57,000
Yeah, I know.

674
00:28:57,000 --> 00:28:59,000
Well, the good thing I missed that so I can do it again and miss it again.

675
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:05,000
I will play until you decide that you want to play as he is go.

676
00:29:05,000 --> 00:29:06,000
Then I will bow out as well.

677
00:29:07,000 --> 00:29:09,000
Yeah, next we stick around it.

678
00:29:09,000 --> 00:29:09,000
Oh.

679
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:14,000
Tell my wife or is it hello?

680
00:29:15,000 --> 00:29:15,000
Hello wife.

681
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:18,000
On the stream.

682
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:19,000
Was that a stream comment?

683
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:20,000
Yeah, I guess.

684
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:23,000
Why, stealth.

685
00:29:23,000 --> 00:29:23,000
Why?

686
00:29:27,000 --> 00:29:30,000
Stealth, how could you be so inconsiderate?

687
00:29:33,000 --> 00:29:33,000
Wow.

688
00:29:33,000 --> 00:29:35,000
Oh, there's a lot of spice.

689
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:39,000
Now I just want to flying a hundred feet in the air.

690
00:29:39,000 --> 00:29:40,000
That's off to the prime.

691
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:41,000
He doesn't mess around.

692
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:43,000
I'm running away.

693
00:29:43,000 --> 00:29:44,000
I'm running into spawn.

694
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:45,000
You can't get me a spawn.

695
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:49,000
Sorry.

696
00:29:49,000 --> 00:29:50,000
Text message.

697
00:29:53,000 --> 00:29:56,000
Do you ever have a problem where like you hit Am or something to change your loadout

698
00:29:56,000 --> 00:29:58,000
and then it opens like the options menu?

699
00:29:59,000 --> 00:30:01,000
Oh, it does that sometimes, yeah.

700
00:30:03,000 --> 00:30:04,000
Just curious.

701
00:30:05,000 --> 00:30:07,000
That is an issue and now I'm going to die right here.

702
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:09,000
That is an issue.

703
00:30:09,000 --> 00:30:10,000
So I should get a tissue.

704
00:30:11,000 --> 00:30:11,000
You know what?

705
00:30:11,000 --> 00:30:13,000
I'm going to go straight up.

706
00:30:13,000 --> 00:30:14,000
It's my fault.

707
00:30:15,000 --> 00:30:15,000
No.

708
00:30:15,000 --> 00:30:16,000
Yes.

709
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:20,000
I'm trying pyro but I'm not having.

710
00:30:20,000 --> 00:30:21,000
Oh, great luck right now.

711
00:30:25,000 --> 00:30:26,000
Oh my god.

712
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:29,000
What is what is going on with the avatars?

713
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:32,000
What the hell is going on?

714
00:30:33,000 --> 00:30:34,000
Why is everybody like a pony?

715
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:37,000
Wait, what?

716
00:30:37,000 --> 00:30:39,000
Hold down tab for a second here.

717
00:30:39,000 --> 00:30:39,000
Yeah.

718
00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:42,000
Is every single avatar a pony for you?

719
00:30:44,000 --> 00:30:44,000
No.

720
00:30:44,000 --> 00:30:46,000
Oh, I can see mine in yours.

721
00:30:47,000 --> 00:30:47,000
Why?

722
00:30:49,000 --> 00:30:49,000
Why?

723
00:30:49,000 --> 00:30:50,000
Yeah, that's all I can see.

724
00:30:52,000 --> 00:30:53,000
Well, that's a...

725
00:30:53,000 --> 00:30:54,000
I have no idea.

726
00:30:55,000 --> 00:30:56,000
Oh my god.

727
00:30:56,000 --> 00:30:57,000
Everyone else in the street can see yours though.

728
00:30:57,000 --> 00:30:58,000
So I guess that's good.

729
00:30:58,000 --> 00:31:02,000
Man, no one has pushed or cart passed the like spawn area here.

730
00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:03,000
I cannot even hit this person.

731
00:31:05,000 --> 00:31:06,000
There we go.

732
00:31:07,000 --> 00:31:09,000
We are getting absolutely dominated.

733
00:31:09,000 --> 00:31:11,000
They're already going up the track.

734
00:31:11,000 --> 00:31:12,000
Where's this pyro?

735
00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:15,000
Oh my god, I'm doing so awful.

736
00:31:17,000 --> 00:31:18,000
Oh my goodness.

737
00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:19,000
No, medic stay alive.

738
00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:20,000
Stay alive.

739
00:31:25,000 --> 00:31:26,000
Mad heck.

740
00:31:26,000 --> 00:31:26,000
Mad heck.

741
00:31:26,000 --> 00:31:27,000
All right, let's get on this cart.

742
00:31:27,000 --> 00:31:28,000
Let's do this.

743
00:31:29,000 --> 00:31:32,000
All right, for some reason no one ever wants to go heavy.

744
00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:34,000
I guess we're going to get back stabbed all the time.

745
00:31:36,000 --> 00:31:38,000
Oh, does that cart really all the way over there?

746
00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:38,000
Right.

747
00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:39,000
Oh my god.

748
00:31:41,000 --> 00:31:42,000
Come on, come at me.

749
00:31:43,000 --> 00:31:45,000
Do you have the cart all the way at that last point?

750
00:31:45,000 --> 00:31:46,000
Are you kidding me?

751
00:31:47,000 --> 00:31:48,000
Holy crap.

752
00:31:50,000 --> 00:31:52,000
Yeah, that was kind of what I was thinking.

753
00:31:52,000 --> 00:31:54,000
How the hell did they get that there?

754
00:31:56,000 --> 00:31:57,000
How the hell did they get there?

755
00:31:57,000 --> 00:31:58,000
Oh, I'm hearing my stream.

756
00:31:58,000 --> 00:32:00,000
Oh, I have to turn this off.

757
00:32:01,000 --> 00:32:02,000
Whoops.

758
00:32:03,000 --> 00:32:04,000
Yeah, that's...

759
00:32:04,000 --> 00:32:06,000
Wow, blue team.

760
00:32:06,000 --> 00:32:07,000
Uh, bravo.

761
00:32:08,000 --> 00:32:08,000
My god.

762
00:32:09,000 --> 00:32:12,000
Look at this, look at this insanity going on here.

763
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:12,000
What is...

764
00:32:13,000 --> 00:32:14,000
Wow.

765
00:32:15,000 --> 00:32:18,000
There was a spy idling in a corner and we were sitting there like

766
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:20,000
pummeling him for about 10 seconds.

767
00:32:20,000 --> 00:32:23,000
I think I'm gonna must have two scouts on the cart.

768
00:32:25,000 --> 00:32:27,000
Get them, get them, oh come on.

769
00:32:29,000 --> 00:32:30,000
That's it, we lost.

770
00:32:31,000 --> 00:32:32,000
That is game over right there.

771
00:32:33,000 --> 00:32:34,000
I can't.

772
00:32:35,000 --> 00:32:36,000
I can't get them.

773
00:32:36,000 --> 00:32:36,000
Oh man.

774
00:32:36,000 --> 00:32:37,000
No, no, it's not game over.

775
00:32:39,000 --> 00:32:40,000
Uh, what do I do?

776
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:41,000
What do I do?

777
00:32:41,000 --> 00:32:41,000
Heavy.

778
00:32:43,000 --> 00:32:43,000
What do I do?

779
00:32:44,000 --> 00:32:45,000
Let's push the car people.

780
00:32:46,000 --> 00:32:47,000
You know what I'm that got?

781
00:32:47,000 --> 00:32:48,000
Get on that got.

782
00:32:52,000 --> 00:32:55,000
All right, I am as paranoid as you could possibly be right now.

783
00:32:56,000 --> 00:32:57,000
And you know what?

784
00:32:57,000 --> 00:32:59,000
I was literally...

785
00:32:59,000 --> 00:33:02,000
I was turning around to check first five behind me and he got me.

786
00:33:02,000 --> 00:33:08,000
Like I was my mouse was my brain was telling my mouse to do that and like I got back to that.

787
00:33:08,000 --> 00:33:10,000
That's why I went pyro.

788
00:33:10,000 --> 00:33:11,000
I'm just like spraying everywhere.

789
00:33:13,000 --> 00:33:14,000
I was just watching you do that.

790
00:33:16,000 --> 00:33:17,000
All right.

791
00:33:18,000 --> 00:33:18,000
Paranoid.

792
00:33:18,000 --> 00:33:19,000
What's up guys?

793
00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:24,000
You know I'm still...

794
00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:27,000
Oh yeah, and again then with the spy even though I'm a pyro,

795
00:33:27,000 --> 00:33:28,000
I've got back to that again.

796
00:33:28,000 --> 00:33:34,000
Oh my god people are just everywhere.

797
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:37,000
I love their message.

798
00:33:39,000 --> 00:33:40,000
Oh they're gonna get it.

799
00:33:40,000 --> 00:33:40,000
They're gonna get it.

800
00:33:42,000 --> 00:33:42,000
All right.

801
00:33:42,000 --> 00:33:44,000
German Wayne playing us right now.

802
00:33:44,000 --> 00:33:45,000
You're playing as a heavy...

803
00:33:45,000 --> 00:33:45,000
Heavy.

804
00:33:46,000 --> 00:33:47,000
Oh where were we?

805
00:33:47,000 --> 00:33:48,000
Six shot.

806
00:33:48,000 --> 00:33:49,000
Six shot.

807
00:33:49,000 --> 00:33:50,000
Whoever that was.

808
00:33:51,000 --> 00:33:52,000
That got that scout off.

809
00:33:55,000 --> 00:33:57,000
German do you love me?

810
00:33:57,000 --> 00:33:58,000
Do you love me?

811
00:33:58,000 --> 00:33:59,000
Do you love me?

812
00:33:59,000 --> 00:34:01,000
Do you love me?

813
00:34:01,000 --> 00:34:03,000
Now that I can't dance.

814
00:34:05,000 --> 00:34:06,000
That's a song right?

815
00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:10,000
Yeah, I would sing it in the shower.

816
00:34:12,000 --> 00:34:13,000
Sure, let's do it.

817
00:34:16,000 --> 00:34:18,000
I'm not gonna do the uncrediting tonight.

818
00:34:19,000 --> 00:34:20,000
I'm gonna be doing...

819
00:34:21,000 --> 00:34:24,000
That's gonna be in a live calm just to straight up video probably next week.

820
00:34:25,000 --> 00:34:27,000
You get out of here.

821
00:34:27,000 --> 00:34:28,000
You're not dead.

822
00:34:28,000 --> 00:34:29,000
I know you're not dead.

823
00:34:29,000 --> 00:34:30,000
I'm jumping away.

824
00:34:30,000 --> 00:34:30,000
I'm getting it.

825
00:34:30,000 --> 00:34:31,000
Yeah, get away from me.

826
00:34:33,000 --> 00:34:34,000
Tiny help.

827
00:34:35,000 --> 00:34:37,000
Oh, do I get help?

828
00:34:37,000 --> 00:34:39,000
Or do I spy check everybody in my team?

829
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:41,000
Whatever works.

830
00:34:42,000 --> 00:34:43,000
I see you up here spy.

831
00:34:44,000 --> 00:34:45,000
You little sniper.

832
00:34:45,000 --> 00:34:47,000
You crazy little sniper.

833
00:34:47,000 --> 00:34:47,000
Yep.

834
00:34:48,000 --> 00:34:50,000
Nice try on your stair step but it didn't work.

835
00:34:50,000 --> 00:34:50,000
Did it?

836
00:34:50,000 --> 00:34:53,000
No, that was not spy.

837
00:34:53,000 --> 00:34:53,000
That guy...

838
00:34:53,000 --> 00:34:53,000
Oh god!

839
00:34:55,000 --> 00:34:55,000
Oh!

840
00:34:58,000 --> 00:34:59,000
Where's the other guy?

841
00:34:59,000 --> 00:35:00,000
Oh my god.

842
00:35:02,000 --> 00:35:03,000
Oh my god!

843
00:35:03,000 --> 00:35:04,000
Where is the other guy?

844
00:35:06,000 --> 00:35:07,000
No more heavy.

845
00:35:07,000 --> 00:35:08,000
I'm gonna go...

846
00:35:10,000 --> 00:35:11,000
Heavy.

847
00:35:11,000 --> 00:35:11,000
I'm staying heavy.

848
00:35:13,000 --> 00:35:14,000
Up there all on the...

849
00:35:14,000 --> 00:35:15,000
They're all on the carto style.

850
00:35:15,000 --> 00:35:16,000
This is my mobile.

851
00:35:18,000 --> 00:35:19,000
Oh my god, did that pyro?

852
00:35:20,000 --> 00:35:22,000
I just went to a pyro on them.

853
00:35:22,000 --> 00:35:23,000
I got at least one, I think.

854
00:35:23,000 --> 00:35:25,000
I gotta eat this so I can run fast.

855
00:35:25,000 --> 00:35:26,000
Oh, up there going.

856
00:35:26,000 --> 00:35:27,000
They're almost there.

857
00:35:27,000 --> 00:35:28,000
They're gonna get it.

858
00:35:28,000 --> 00:35:30,000
So that means I can run away because I just took this...

859
00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:31,000
There's three people on it?

860
00:35:32,000 --> 00:35:33,000
Oh, they're definitely gonna get it.

861
00:35:33,000 --> 00:35:35,000
Yeah, see how fast I'm running?

862
00:35:37,000 --> 00:35:40,000
You won't get the satisfaction of killing me.

863
00:35:42,000 --> 00:35:43,000
Actually, he kind of did.

864
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:46,000
He kind of did get the satisfaction of killing me.

865
00:35:46,000 --> 00:35:47,000
Too late.

866
00:35:50,000 --> 00:35:51,000
I am bit...

867
00:35:51,000 --> 00:35:52,000
No, I have to...

868
00:35:52,000 --> 00:35:54,000
Oh, do I go medic?

869
00:35:54,000 --> 00:35:55,000
I...

870
00:35:55,000 --> 00:35:55,000
I'm gonna wreck sniper.

871
00:35:57,000 --> 00:35:58,000
I'm still too paranoid, man.

872
00:35:58,000 --> 00:35:58,000
I'm just like...

873
00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:02,000
I'm spraying inside the spawn area.

874
00:36:02,000 --> 00:36:03,000
That's how paranoid I am.

875
00:36:05,000 --> 00:36:06,000
Now that's paranoid for you.

876
00:36:09,000 --> 00:36:10,000
No, they all blew up.

877
00:36:11,000 --> 00:36:12,000
You are R-S-5.

878
00:36:12,000 --> 00:36:13,000
Are you not?

879
00:36:13,000 --> 00:36:14,000
Apparently I am dueling.

880
00:36:20,000 --> 00:36:20,000
Damn.

881
00:36:22,000 --> 00:36:22,000
Oh, what...

882
00:36:25,000 --> 00:36:27,000
I don't even know what just happened.

883
00:36:27,000 --> 00:36:29,000
I was like checking around too.

884
00:36:29,000 --> 00:36:30,000
I'm going medic.

885
00:36:30,000 --> 00:36:32,000
It's the best thing to do right now.

886
00:36:34,000 --> 00:36:36,000
Oh, ow, ow, ow, ow, ow.

887
00:36:39,000 --> 00:36:39,000
Spy.

888
00:36:42,000 --> 00:36:43,000
I'm just gonna go heal, bot medic.

889
00:36:44,000 --> 00:36:45,000
And I can make sure everyone stays alive.

890
00:36:45,000 --> 00:36:47,000
I'm gonna have my back turn the entire time.

891
00:36:48,000 --> 00:36:50,000
Do it, man.

892
00:36:51,000 --> 00:36:52,000
The entire time.

893
00:36:54,000 --> 00:36:54,000
We have like...

894
00:36:55,000 --> 00:36:57,000
Oh, we have two pyres on the team right now.

895
00:36:57,000 --> 00:36:58,000
We have like three earlier.

896
00:36:58,000 --> 00:36:59,000
People were just so paranoid.

897
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:02,000
Oh, you get caught up here.

898
00:37:04,000 --> 00:37:05,000
Oh, god.

899
00:37:05,000 --> 00:37:06,000
And there's another spy.

900
00:37:07,000 --> 00:37:07,000
God, run away.

901
00:37:08,000 --> 00:37:10,000
Help me, somebody help me.

902
00:37:11,000 --> 00:37:11,000
Stay still.

903
00:37:12,000 --> 00:37:13,000
Stay close to the blue red.

904
00:37:14,000 --> 00:37:15,000
I can't live it and hit him.

905
00:37:16,000 --> 00:37:17,000
Oh, he's gonna kill me.

906
00:37:17,000 --> 00:37:18,000
Oh, my god.

907
00:37:18,000 --> 00:37:19,000
I'm a lucky son of a bitch.

908
00:37:20,000 --> 00:37:21,000
I'm...

909
00:37:21,000 --> 00:37:22,000
I gotta run away.

910
00:37:22,000 --> 00:37:23,000
I am on.

911
00:37:23,000 --> 00:37:23,000
What do you say?

912
00:37:23,000 --> 00:37:23,000
I'm on.

913
00:37:23,000 --> 00:37:24,000
What do you say?

914
00:37:25,000 --> 00:37:25,000
Oh, shit.

915
00:37:25,000 --> 00:37:26,000
Oh, no.

916
00:37:26,000 --> 00:37:26,000
I didn't want to do that.

917
00:37:26,000 --> 00:37:27,000
Oh, god.

918
00:37:28,000 --> 00:37:30,000
I just like traded with somebody.

919
00:37:31,000 --> 00:37:34,000
Dude, no one is pushing our cart, including myself.

920
00:37:34,000 --> 00:37:35,000
Oh, but I love it.

921
00:37:36,000 --> 00:37:37,000
It's still like right there.

922
00:37:39,000 --> 00:37:40,000
He's still right there.

923
00:37:41,000 --> 00:37:42,000
Right there.

924
00:37:42,000 --> 00:37:43,000
It's fun, man.

925
00:37:43,000 --> 00:37:45,000
Actually, to be quite honest with you,

926
00:37:45,000 --> 00:37:46,000
that was the most success I've had.

927
00:37:46,000 --> 00:37:48,000
All game is with that medic.

928
00:37:49,000 --> 00:37:51,000
And I healed like two people.

929
00:37:56,000 --> 00:37:57,000
Medic.

930
00:37:58,000 --> 00:37:59,000
All right, I'll get another medic.

931
00:38:02,000 --> 00:38:02,000
Medic.

932
00:38:03,000 --> 00:38:03,000
Stop.

933
00:38:06,000 --> 00:38:07,000
Oh, suicide medic.

934
00:38:09,000 --> 00:38:11,000
All this guy is toast.

935
00:38:13,000 --> 00:38:14,000
Oh, we're moving down the highway.

936
00:38:14,000 --> 00:38:14,000
Switch.

937
00:38:14,000 --> 00:38:16,000
Oh, you'll see how much spies are on their team.

938
00:38:19,000 --> 00:38:20,000
Just the count.

939
00:38:20,000 --> 00:38:21,000
It's gotta be at least three.

940
00:38:22,000 --> 00:38:23,000
It's gotta be.

941
00:38:23,000 --> 00:38:24,000
If it's not, then I'm wrong.

942
00:38:27,000 --> 00:38:27,000
I need to...

943
00:38:27,000 --> 00:38:28,000
You know what?

944
00:38:28,000 --> 00:38:29,000
Take off the gridscrew.

945
00:38:30,000 --> 00:38:30,000
Quick fix.

946
00:38:32,000 --> 00:38:32,000
Quick fix.

947
00:38:36,000 --> 00:38:37,000
No trades.

948
00:38:39,000 --> 00:38:41,000
I don't take the trades right now.

949
00:38:41,000 --> 00:38:42,000
That was a terrible scar.

950
00:38:42,000 --> 00:38:44,000
Now it's supposed to be a Scottish accent, guys.

951
00:38:44,000 --> 00:38:45,000
How terrible is that?

952
00:38:47,000 --> 00:38:48,000
That's a spy.

953
00:38:48,000 --> 00:38:50,000
I am certain of this.

954
00:38:50,000 --> 00:38:51,000
No, I guess I'm wrong.

955
00:38:52,000 --> 00:38:53,000
Oh, barely got me.

956
00:38:54,000 --> 00:38:56,000
And I'm like getting people killed because I'm checking if this...

957
00:39:00,000 --> 00:39:01,000
Did I just heal this spy?

958
00:39:01,000 --> 00:39:02,000
No, I didn't.

959
00:39:02,000 --> 00:39:03,000
No way.

960
00:39:03,000 --> 00:39:05,000
Dude, we've got four pyros on our team now.

961
00:39:07,000 --> 00:39:09,000
The people they are listening, they're like...

962
00:39:10,000 --> 00:39:11,000
Enough of this nonsense.

963
00:39:11,000 --> 00:39:13,000
We are like getting shot from.

964
00:39:13,000 --> 00:39:15,000
I don't even know where they're coming from.

965
00:39:15,000 --> 00:39:17,000
It's almost like they're coming out of our spawn.

966
00:39:21,000 --> 00:39:23,000
I'm going pyro on easy mode right here.

967
00:39:23,000 --> 00:39:24,000
I've got like the back burner,

968
00:39:24,000 --> 00:39:25,000
so I don't even have to think.

969
00:39:25,000 --> 00:39:26,000
Just like spray.

970
00:39:29,000 --> 00:39:30,000
I'm trying to use the...

971
00:39:31,000 --> 00:39:31,000
The quick fix.

972
00:39:33,000 --> 00:39:34,000
You know, I'm gonna heal you.

973
00:39:34,000 --> 00:39:36,000
We're just gonna run like the dickens.

974
00:39:36,000 --> 00:39:37,000
Uh-oh, run away.

975
00:39:38,000 --> 00:39:39,000
Look at all the...

976
00:39:39,000 --> 00:39:39,000
What?

977
00:39:40,000 --> 00:39:41,000
Those are all spies.

978
00:39:43,000 --> 00:39:43,000
At least...

979
00:39:43,000 --> 00:39:46,000
Oh my god, this is the worst thing ever.

980
00:39:47,000 --> 00:39:49,000
Oh my god, chaos.

981
00:39:50,000 --> 00:39:50,000
Run.

982
00:39:54,000 --> 00:39:55,000
Oh my god, dude.

983
00:39:56,000 --> 00:39:58,000
They keep running into like the same heavy.

984
00:39:58,000 --> 00:39:59,000
I'm playing spy.

985
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:02,000
We are trapped in this spawn area right now.

986
00:40:04,000 --> 00:40:05,000
Where are you coming out from?

987
00:40:05,000 --> 00:40:07,000
Left, right, or is center?

988
00:40:07,000 --> 00:40:09,000
I keep going out because I'm a medic, so...

989
00:40:10,000 --> 00:40:11,000
I'm trying to cart the middle.

990
00:40:13,000 --> 00:40:14,000
God, somebody just killed me, so I can just...

991
00:40:15,000 --> 00:40:17,000
Get a backstab and feel good about myself.

992
00:40:17,000 --> 00:40:17,000
Look at this.

993
00:40:17,000 --> 00:40:18,000
Look at this, K-Goth.

994
00:40:19,000 --> 00:40:20,000
You gotta be.

995
00:40:20,000 --> 00:40:21,000
S-I-I can't even say it.

996
00:40:21,000 --> 00:40:22,000
I'm so upset.

997
00:40:24,000 --> 00:40:26,000
All right, let's make some statues.

998
00:40:29,000 --> 00:40:30,000
Oh, my god.

999
00:40:30,000 --> 00:40:32,000
I'm on my Giorg team.

1000
00:40:32,000 --> 00:40:32,000
Oh, great.

1001
00:40:32,000 --> 00:40:33,000
Now he knows I'm a spy.

1002
00:40:33,000 --> 00:40:34,000
All right.

1003
00:40:38,000 --> 00:40:39,000
Oh jeez.

1004
00:40:39,000 --> 00:40:40,000
Oh my god, I'm...

1005
00:40:40,000 --> 00:40:42,000
I can't get out of spawn either, man.

1006
00:40:43,000 --> 00:40:46,000
I'm just using the Infos or the kill people.

1007
00:40:51,000 --> 00:40:53,000
As soon as I said there were four Pyro's,

1008
00:40:53,000 --> 00:40:55,000
everyone switched back on our team.

1009
00:40:55,000 --> 00:40:56,000
Oh god, it'll lose.

1010
00:40:59,000 --> 00:41:01,000
Oh man, I got blasted right there.

1011
00:41:04,000 --> 00:41:06,000
All right, after this, we're going to another server.

1012
00:41:08,000 --> 00:41:11,000
Because we need to scramble these teams.

1013
00:41:14,000 --> 00:41:16,000
They've got a Century Gun right next to our cart.

1014
00:41:17,000 --> 00:41:17,000
Really?

1015
00:41:18,000 --> 00:41:19,000
That's not cool.

1016
00:41:21,000 --> 00:41:23,000
Hey, you know what's the note I'll say?

1017
00:41:24,000 --> 00:41:25,000
What do you have?

1018
00:41:26,000 --> 00:41:27,000
What you got?

1019
00:41:27,000 --> 00:41:27,000
No!

1020
00:41:29,000 --> 00:41:31,000
And they're already winning again.

1021
00:41:31,000 --> 00:41:33,000
Oh god, no.

1022
00:41:33,000 --> 00:41:34,000
No, please, no.

1023
00:41:37,000 --> 00:41:38,000
All these ponies.

1024
00:41:42,000 --> 00:41:43,000
You know what, when all else fails,

1025
00:41:43,000 --> 00:41:44,000
you just go...

1026
00:41:44,000 --> 00:41:46,000
Pretty sure there's at least two people idling.

1027
00:41:48,000 --> 00:41:50,000
Well, at least when all else fails,

1028
00:41:50,000 --> 00:41:51,000
you go straight up, Demonite.

1029
00:41:53,000 --> 00:41:54,000
And if that don't work,

1030
00:41:55,000 --> 00:41:56,000
I just speaking of the Giorg,

1031
00:41:56,000 --> 00:41:57,000
Morgan.

1032
00:41:57,000 --> 00:41:58,000
That's what I just went.

1033
00:42:00,000 --> 00:42:02,000
All right, like right before you said that.

1034
00:42:02,000 --> 00:42:04,000
Oh my god, I'm just doing good.

1035
00:42:04,000 --> 00:42:05,000
I love that.

1036
00:42:06,000 --> 00:42:08,000
I just charged out of spawn,

1037
00:42:08,000 --> 00:42:10,000
and I flew like 5,000 people.

1038
00:42:12,000 --> 00:42:13,000
Come on, Laz!

1039
00:42:13,000 --> 00:42:13,000
Come on, Laz!

1040
00:42:13,000 --> 00:42:14,000
Get him!

1041
00:42:14,000 --> 00:42:15,000
Get him!

1042
00:42:15,000 --> 00:42:17,000
It's all up to you!

1043
00:42:17,000 --> 00:42:18,000
And he did it.

1044
00:42:18,000 --> 00:42:18,000
He's the champion.

1045
00:42:22,000 --> 00:42:23,000
All right, this...

1046
00:42:23,000 --> 00:42:24,000
There's a gotta be a spark right here.

1047
00:42:26,000 --> 00:42:27,000
Get out of town.

1048
00:42:30,000 --> 00:42:31,000
Like, I got one of the splits.

1049
00:42:32,000 --> 00:42:32,000
One night.

1050
00:42:33,000 --> 00:42:34,000
Oh no, I got...

1051
00:42:34,000 --> 00:42:35,000
Oh no.

1052
00:42:35,000 --> 00:42:36,000
Server change.

1053
00:42:40,000 --> 00:42:41,000
It's time to change, Servers.

1054
00:42:45,000 --> 00:42:45,000
Let's go to...

1055
00:42:45,000 --> 00:42:46,000
I want to go two weeks.

1056
00:42:48,000 --> 00:42:49,000
A server we can win on.

1057
00:42:50,000 --> 00:42:52,000
Well, I'm just kidding.

1058
00:42:52,000 --> 00:42:53,000
I want to go to my server.

1059
00:42:53,000 --> 00:42:55,000
I want to go to a bold rush.

1060
00:42:55,000 --> 00:42:56,000
Sounds good.

1061
00:42:58,000 --> 00:42:59,000
Are you ready?

1062
00:43:00,000 --> 00:43:01,000
Yes.

1063
00:43:02,000 --> 00:43:03,000
So, the...

1064
00:43:03,000 --> 00:43:04,000
What's going on here?

1065
00:43:04,000 --> 00:43:07,000
72.9.

1066
00:43:08,000 --> 00:43:09,000
.146.

1067
00:43:10,000 --> 00:43:11,000
.118.

1068
00:43:12,000 --> 00:43:14,000
Call on 27015.

1069
00:43:14,000 --> 00:43:14,000
Go!

1070
00:43:16,000 --> 00:43:18,000
You almost lost me on the colon,

1071
00:43:18,000 --> 00:43:19,000
but I think I got it.

1072
00:43:20,000 --> 00:43:22,000
Colon 27015.

1073
00:43:22,000 --> 00:43:23,000
27015.

1074
00:43:25,000 --> 00:43:26,000
1501557.

1075
00:43:27,000 --> 00:43:28,000
What's the password?

1076
00:43:28,000 --> 00:43:29,000
What are the first?

1077
00:43:29,000 --> 00:43:29,000
Yes.

1078
00:43:31,000 --> 00:43:32,000
That's a pretty easy password.

1079
00:43:33,000 --> 00:43:33,000
So,

1080
00:43:34,000 --> 00:43:34,000
deal with it.

1081
00:43:38,000 --> 00:43:38,000
Yeah, I mean,

1082
00:43:39,000 --> 00:43:42,000
my YouTube password was 1-2-3 for a long time.

1083
00:43:42,000 --> 00:43:42,000
I'm just kidding.

1084
00:43:43,000 --> 00:43:44,000
Told me I had to change it.

1085
00:43:45,000 --> 00:43:47,000
Oh, I got dropped due to...

1086
00:43:47,000 --> 00:43:47,000
Just what was it?

1087
00:43:47,000 --> 00:43:49,000
We went in there first.

1088
00:43:49,000 --> 00:43:50,000
How is that possible?

1089
00:43:51,000 --> 00:43:51,000
Okay.

1090
00:43:54,000 --> 00:43:56,000
Sorry, those are new letters.

1091
00:43:56,000 --> 00:43:57,000
How is that making sense?

1092
00:43:58,000 --> 00:44:00,000
We were on our way in before I...

1093
00:44:00,000 --> 00:44:01,000
We were like in the game.

1094
00:44:02,000 --> 00:44:06,000
Well, I apologize to those of you that just got into that server, but we have to change.

1095
00:44:08,000 --> 00:44:13,000
So, 98.158.

1096
00:44:13,000 --> 00:44:16,000
.87.226.

1097
00:44:17,000 --> 00:44:19,000
Colon 27040.

1098
00:44:20,000 --> 00:44:22,000
All right, now I'm going to wait a second before I give the sound.

1099
00:44:24,000 --> 00:44:26,000
Well, if they're probably listening,

1100
00:44:27,000 --> 00:44:30,000
yeah, but it's like a 10 second delay though.

1101
00:44:32,000 --> 00:44:32,000
Yeah, but still,

1102
00:44:33,000 --> 00:44:36,000
there's somebody out there with this ridiculous internet speeds.

1103
00:44:37,000 --> 00:44:38,000
Yeah, and I can just...

1104
00:44:38,000 --> 00:44:40,000
I can just come right in.

1105
00:44:41,000 --> 00:44:43,000
Pipeline payload.

1106
00:44:43,000 --> 00:44:46,000
Yes, Strangeloven, this is a talix point.

1107
00:44:46,000 --> 00:44:47,000
You are correct.

1108
00:44:47,000 --> 00:44:51,000
Hey guys, hey Strangeloven, how's it going?

1109
00:44:51,000 --> 00:44:52,000
So, this is the server?

1110
00:44:53,000 --> 00:44:54,000
Wait, did that...

1111
00:44:54,000 --> 00:44:55,000
What? Wait, hold on a second.

1112
00:44:56,000 --> 00:44:57,000
Did that already fill up?

1113
00:44:58,000 --> 00:44:59,000
Well, we already full.

1114
00:45:00,000 --> 00:45:00,000
I didn't...

1115
00:45:00,000 --> 00:45:01,000
Oh, somebody else put it in.

1116
00:45:01,000 --> 00:45:03,000
Okay, thank you to whoever put that in.

1117
00:45:03,000 --> 00:45:03,000
Thank you.

1118
00:45:03,000 --> 00:45:04,000
I appreciate it.

1119
00:45:05,000 --> 00:45:06,000
I thought you didn't join.

1120
00:45:06,000 --> 00:45:07,000
That's what I thought at first.

1121
00:45:09,000 --> 00:45:10,000
Oh God.

1122
00:45:10,000 --> 00:45:12,000
This is like a jellyfish server.

1123
00:45:16,000 --> 00:45:19,000
Like the screen is motor like a jellyfish for me right now.

1124
00:45:20,000 --> 00:45:22,000
Look at how laggy everybody is.

1125
00:45:22,000 --> 00:45:23,000
Look at this.

1126
00:45:23,000 --> 00:45:23,000
I feel like it's like...

1127
00:45:24,000 --> 00:45:27,000
Oh my god, look at this claymation server.

1128
00:45:28,000 --> 00:45:29,000
Look at that.

1129
00:45:29,000 --> 00:45:30,000
Hey, let me see.

1130
00:45:30,000 --> 00:45:30,000
What?

1131
00:45:31,000 --> 00:45:32,000
Well, uh...

1132
00:45:33,000 --> 00:45:34,000
Oh, look at the pings.

1133
00:45:34,000 --> 00:45:35,000
My goodness gracious.

1134
00:45:36,000 --> 00:45:39,000
Everyone except for me and you is like a hundred plus.

1135
00:45:39,000 --> 00:45:42,000
It really looks like a stop motion animation.

1136
00:45:42,000 --> 00:45:43,000
Like video.

1137
00:45:44,000 --> 00:45:45,000
I feel now.

1138
00:45:45,000 --> 00:45:45,000
I'm like...

1139
00:45:48,000 --> 00:45:51,000
It feels like I'm playing at 20 frames per second.

1140
00:45:51,000 --> 00:45:51,000
But...

1141
00:45:51,000 --> 00:45:51,000
But I'm not.

1142
00:45:52,000 --> 00:45:53,000
But I'm not.

1143
00:45:53,000 --> 00:45:55,000
Oh, I'm sorry guys.

1144
00:45:55,000 --> 00:45:56,000
Look at...

1145
00:45:56,000 --> 00:45:58,000
We gotta change again because this is just bad.

1146
00:45:58,000 --> 00:45:59,000
All right.

1147
00:45:59,000 --> 00:45:59,000
This is not...

1148
00:45:59,000 --> 00:46:02,000
This is not against the people who are here.

1149
00:46:02,000 --> 00:46:03,000
This is more of the people who didn't get in.

1150
00:46:04,000 --> 00:46:05,000
Yeah, it's right.

1151
00:46:05,000 --> 00:46:08,000
It tells if you can look at the stream and see what I see right now.

1152
00:46:08,000 --> 00:46:09,000
It is like...

1153
00:46:10,000 --> 00:46:10,000
It is...

1154
00:46:11,000 --> 00:46:13,000
Pretty much like I'm watching a cartoon on drugs.

1155
00:46:18,000 --> 00:46:19,000
All right.

1156
00:46:19,000 --> 00:46:21,000
Well, yeah, it looks like nobody could even get into this one.

1157
00:46:21,000 --> 00:46:23,000
There was only seven on eight.

1158
00:46:24,000 --> 00:46:25,000
I should begin.

1159
00:46:25,000 --> 00:46:26,000
I apologize.

1160
00:46:26,000 --> 00:46:27,000
I sorry.

1161
00:46:28,000 --> 00:46:29,000
New server.

1162
00:46:31,000 --> 00:46:31,000
Take three.

1163
00:46:32,000 --> 00:46:33,000
Yeah, third time's a charm.

1164
00:46:33,000 --> 00:46:34,000
Third time.

1165
00:46:34,000 --> 00:46:34,000
I want...

1166
00:46:35,000 --> 00:46:36,000
Ah, two.

1167
00:46:37,000 --> 00:46:38,000
Ah, three.

1168
00:46:38,000 --> 00:46:39,000
Crunch.

1169
00:46:39,000 --> 00:46:40,000
So wait until I get my third...

1170
00:46:40,000 --> 00:46:42,000
I'm probably going to get a 32 person server.

1171
00:46:42,000 --> 00:46:43,000
I'm going to hope I can.

1172
00:46:43,000 --> 00:46:45,000
But wait until I get that server.

1173
00:46:45,000 --> 00:46:46,000
We'll be okay.

1174
00:46:47,000 --> 00:46:49,000
I want to server all the cool kids.

1175
00:46:49,000 --> 00:46:49,000
Half one.

1176
00:46:50,000 --> 00:46:50,000
All right.

1177
00:46:50,000 --> 00:46:51,000
Here we go.

1178
00:46:52,000 --> 00:46:53,000
66.

1179
00:46:53,000 --> 00:46:56,000
Docs 55.154.

1180
00:46:57,000 --> 00:46:59,000
Doc 234.

1181
00:46:59,000 --> 00:47:01,000
Cole and 27015.

1182
00:47:02,000 --> 00:47:03,000
And we paste this in.

1183
00:47:03,000 --> 00:47:04,000
And a second once we get in.

1184
00:47:05,000 --> 00:47:08,000
I do apologize that we have to do this twice.

1185
00:47:08,000 --> 00:47:09,000
And that was the third time.

1186
00:47:09,000 --> 00:47:12,000
Hopefully this one is going to be the good one.

1187
00:47:12,000 --> 00:47:13,000
They pasted it in already.

1188
00:47:13,000 --> 00:47:14,000
You did really?

1189
00:47:15,000 --> 00:47:16,000
I told you.

1190
00:47:16,000 --> 00:47:18,000
It was like literally two seconds after you said it.

1191
00:47:18,000 --> 00:47:19,000
I saw it pop up in the chat.

1192
00:47:20,000 --> 00:47:20,000
You guys are fast.

1193
00:47:21,000 --> 00:47:24,000
Oh, lightning fast, even.

1194
00:47:24,000 --> 00:47:24,000
You might say.

1195
00:47:24,000 --> 00:47:26,000
You can say that.

1196
00:47:34,000 --> 00:47:35,000
Oh, oh.

1197
00:47:38,000 --> 00:47:39,000
I am going demo night.

1198
00:47:40,000 --> 00:47:41,000
DEMO MAU.

1199
00:47:41,000 --> 00:47:42,000
Actually found.

1200
00:47:42,000 --> 00:47:43,000
Oh, sorry.

1201
00:47:43,000 --> 00:47:43,000
What?

1202
00:47:43,000 --> 00:47:44,000
As a demo MAU.

1203
00:47:44,000 --> 00:47:46,000
And I was just relangling what you just said.

1204
00:47:47,000 --> 00:47:50,000
I actually found a Sultan ceremonial the other day.

1205
00:47:51,000 --> 00:47:53,000
Oh, I was very happy about that.

1206
00:47:53,000 --> 00:47:54,000
Very cool.

1207
00:47:54,000 --> 00:47:58,000
So now I can have a legit demo night if I wanted to give up my grenade launcher.

1208
00:47:58,000 --> 00:48:02,000
But it's a tough call for the for the booties.

1209
00:48:02,000 --> 00:48:03,000
Yeah.

1210
00:48:03,000 --> 00:48:04,000
booties.

1211
00:48:05,000 --> 00:48:08,000
And then we got Stimidate here with this wicked sick hat.

1212
00:48:16,000 --> 00:48:17,000
So I have to do this right now.

1213
00:48:18,000 --> 00:48:24,000
Because somebody keeps sending me a very inappropriate message.

1214
00:48:24,000 --> 00:48:26,000
And hopefully that stops that from happening.

1215
00:48:26,000 --> 00:48:28,000
I don't think it will, but I at least tried.

1216
00:48:32,000 --> 00:48:32,000
Oh.

1217
00:48:33,000 --> 00:48:34,000
Okay.

1218
00:48:36,000 --> 00:48:37,000
All right, we got a full serving now.

1219
00:48:37,000 --> 00:48:37,000
Good to go.

1220
00:48:37,000 --> 00:48:38,000
Let's go.

1221
00:48:38,000 --> 00:48:38,000
Let's go.

1222
00:48:39,000 --> 00:48:40,000
Just in time.

1223
00:48:40,000 --> 00:48:41,000
But it's off the real way.

1224
00:48:42,000 --> 00:48:44,000
Like everyone.

1225
00:48:44,000 --> 00:48:46,000
Oh, so over at the same time.

1226
00:48:46,000 --> 00:48:47,000
Oh my god.

1227
00:48:47,000 --> 00:48:49,000
You just totally predicted where I was going to shoot.

1228
00:48:51,000 --> 00:48:52,000
Shotgun soldier.

1229
00:48:54,000 --> 00:48:55,000
Shotgun soldier.

1230
00:48:58,000 --> 00:48:59,000
Oh my god.

1231
00:49:00,000 --> 00:49:01,000
Did you see that?

1232
00:49:01,000 --> 00:49:02,000
Yeah, yeah.

1233
00:49:03,000 --> 00:49:04,000
I've loved him a night.

1234
00:49:06,000 --> 00:49:07,000
Yeah, I have only so far given one third.

1235
00:49:07,000 --> 00:49:09,000
I'm still waiting on two people.

1236
00:49:09,000 --> 00:49:14,000
So eventually I will be giving 100% but I have to wait for the other two people to get back to me.

1237
00:49:15,000 --> 00:49:16,000
Oh.

1238
00:49:16,000 --> 00:49:17,000
That hurts.

1239
00:49:20,000 --> 00:49:21,000
Oh, dear.

1240
00:49:21,000 --> 00:49:21,000
I made quite a mess.

1241
00:49:23,000 --> 00:49:25,000
Someone on the team was announcing how many spies they have.

1242
00:49:25,000 --> 00:49:26,000
They have four, apparently.

1243
00:49:28,000 --> 00:49:29,000
I want a good trader.

1244
00:49:29,000 --> 00:49:29,000
He is.

1245
00:49:31,000 --> 00:49:33,000
How ironic is that?

1246
00:49:33,000 --> 00:49:34,000
So he's a double spy.

1247
00:49:34,000 --> 00:49:37,000
Yeah, so he's telling us about spies.

1248
00:49:37,000 --> 00:49:41,000
So he's spying on the spies for his own spies.

1249
00:49:42,000 --> 00:49:44,000
As someone in the comments will undoubtedly say,

1250
00:49:44,000 --> 00:49:45,000
spy section.

1251
00:49:45,000 --> 00:49:45,000
Yep.

1252
00:49:45,000 --> 00:49:47,000
That is absolutely what it is.

1253
00:49:50,000 --> 00:49:51,000
Not far from this.

1254
00:49:51,000 --> 00:49:52,000
Maybe he's why.

1255
00:49:52,000 --> 00:49:52,000
Why?

1256
00:49:52,000 --> 00:49:54,000
Hmm, or suspicious.

1257
00:49:54,000 --> 00:49:55,000
Oh.

1258
00:49:56,000 --> 00:49:57,000
Maybe he's a triple spy.

1259
00:49:58,000 --> 00:50:00,000
He said, I served no one.

1260
00:50:01,000 --> 00:50:03,000
DTA, don't trust anyone.

1261
00:50:03,000 --> 00:50:05,000
Like, I like your attitude.

1262
00:50:05,000 --> 00:50:06,000
And that's his fine.

1263
00:50:06,000 --> 00:50:07,000
He's his dire.

1264
00:50:07,000 --> 00:50:09,000
He's going to get ugly and he's going to try and stare at me.

1265
00:50:09,000 --> 00:50:10,000
I already know this.

1266
00:50:10,000 --> 00:50:11,000
I already know this.

1267
00:50:11,000 --> 00:50:13,000
I've been around the block a few times.

1268
00:50:15,000 --> 00:50:16,000
You know what?

1269
00:50:17,000 --> 00:50:18,000
You, I'm going to stand right here.

1270
00:50:19,000 --> 00:50:20,000
You're going to have to go that way.

1271
00:50:22,000 --> 00:50:22,000
Oh god.

1272
00:50:23,000 --> 00:50:23,000
Oh no.

1273
00:50:26,000 --> 00:50:26,000
Oh.

1274
00:50:39,000 --> 00:50:41,000
See where.

1275
00:50:44,000 --> 00:50:45,000
On the old and time.

1276
00:50:45,000 --> 00:50:47,000
Oh, we got, we got the bluebird pyro going down here.

1277
00:50:47,000 --> 00:50:48,000
Oh my god.

1278
00:50:52,000 --> 00:50:54,000
Well, you just die of pyro.

1279
00:50:54,000 --> 00:50:55,000
What am I doing?

1280
00:50:56,000 --> 00:50:57,000
Well, they're almost there, man.

1281
00:50:57,000 --> 00:51:00,000
They're right at the edge with seven minutes and 40 seconds to go.

1282
00:51:00,000 --> 00:51:01,000
We can do this.

1283
00:51:01,000 --> 00:51:01,000
We can do this.

1284
00:51:01,000 --> 00:51:02,000
Oh, come on.

1285
00:51:02,000 --> 00:51:03,000
I would have had it.

1286
00:51:03,000 --> 00:51:03,000
I would have had it.

1287
00:51:07,000 --> 00:51:07,000
I would have had it.

1288
00:51:07,000 --> 00:51:09,000
I was being sarcastic, by the way.

1289
00:51:09,000 --> 00:51:10,000
I had no faith.

1290
00:51:18,000 --> 00:51:20,000
I don't even know if that's how you spell it, but that's what I'm doing.

1291
00:51:21,000 --> 00:51:26,000
I love how the highest score scoring player on our team is four points and was like a

1292
00:51:26,000 --> 00:51:28,000
four-way tie for four.

1293
00:51:30,000 --> 00:51:31,000
Me included.

1294
00:51:32,000 --> 00:51:34,000
Yeah, yeah, four, four, four, four, four, four, three.

1295
00:51:35,000 --> 00:51:35,000
Oh.

1296
00:51:41,000 --> 00:51:42,000
I don't scrambling the teams.

1297
00:51:43,000 --> 00:51:44,000
Well, that's one way to do it.

1298
00:51:45,000 --> 00:51:46,000
Whoa.

1299
00:51:47,000 --> 00:51:48,000
All right.

1300
00:51:48,000 --> 00:51:48,000
I'm sure.

1301
00:51:48,000 --> 00:51:50,000
This is a goodbye.

1302
00:51:52,000 --> 00:51:53,000
Are you changed your name?

1303
00:51:53,000 --> 00:51:53,000
I'm hard to name.

1304
00:51:53,000 --> 00:51:54,000
Yeah, I did.

1305
00:51:56,000 --> 00:51:56,000
Did you guess who I am?

1306
00:51:57,000 --> 00:51:59,000
Well, I'm not hard.

1307
00:51:59,000 --> 00:52:01,000
Yes, because I can see your icon.

1308
00:52:02,000 --> 00:52:03,000
Henderson in corporate.

1309
00:52:03,000 --> 00:52:09,000
We sell carpets and we do floor finishing.

1310
00:52:09,000 --> 00:52:11,000
Where do you come up with your name?

1311
00:52:11,000 --> 00:52:13,000
So you just look at something and say, okay, I'm going to take that.

1312
00:52:13,000 --> 00:52:13,000
Kind of.

1313
00:52:14,000 --> 00:52:17,000
It's just whatever is in my brain at that particular second is what it is.

1314
00:52:17,000 --> 00:52:19,000
Oh, I tried to high five you.

1315
00:52:20,000 --> 00:52:23,000
So this is going to be the last round of TF2 and then I'm going to move on to CS.

1316
00:52:23,000 --> 00:52:24,000
Go for a little bit.

1317
00:52:25,000 --> 00:52:26,000
I got to make a count then.

1318
00:52:27,000 --> 00:52:29,000
Oh, then you have it, right?

1319
00:52:30,000 --> 00:52:31,000
I don't have CS go.

1320
00:52:33,000 --> 00:52:33,000
That's what I was saying.

1321
00:52:33,000 --> 00:52:36,000
I'm going to have to bow out when you switch games.

1322
00:52:37,000 --> 00:52:37,000
Let's go.

1323
00:52:37,000 --> 00:52:38,000
I mean, we've been playing for about an hour or something.

1324
00:52:39,000 --> 00:52:41,000
Still still has it, but he.

1325
00:52:42,000 --> 00:52:43,000
Yeah, he's I mean, he didn't do the eat.

1326
00:52:43,000 --> 00:52:46,000
I mean, he's seen macaroni and cheese and like dog food.

1327
00:52:46,000 --> 00:52:47,000
Whatever he eats.

1328
00:52:49,000 --> 00:52:50,000
Dude, I don't you're making me hungry, man.

1329
00:52:52,000 --> 00:52:52,000
Macaroni G's.

1330
00:52:52,000 --> 00:52:53,000
Oh, John fluid.

1331
00:52:53,000 --> 00:52:54,000
Come on.

1332
00:52:54,000 --> 00:52:56,000
Oh, that's delicacy.

1333
00:52:56,000 --> 00:52:57,000
Watch out, Uber.

1334
00:52:57,000 --> 00:52:58,000
Right up the door.

1335
00:52:59,000 --> 00:53:00,000
Oh my god.

1336
00:53:00,000 --> 00:53:02,000
That guy just killed every single person in your

1337
00:53:03,000 --> 00:53:04,000
life.

1338
00:53:06,000 --> 00:53:08,000
So stealth must be watching the stream.

1339
00:53:11,000 --> 00:53:12,000
Why is he responding?

1340
00:53:13,000 --> 00:53:13,000
I don't know.

1341
00:53:13,000 --> 00:53:14,000
Scrains love your cities here.

1342
00:53:14,000 --> 00:53:15,000
He's in here.

1343
00:53:19,000 --> 00:53:20,000
Oh my god.

1344
00:53:20,000 --> 00:53:22,000
He's eating his watch and it at the tape at this parents.

1345
00:53:22,000 --> 00:53:24,000
Imagine he has his laptop out.

1346
00:53:27,000 --> 00:53:28,000
I should have done the buff banner.

1347
00:53:28,000 --> 00:53:29,000
I really should have.

1348
00:53:30,000 --> 00:53:31,000
I got to kill that.

1349
00:53:31,000 --> 00:53:32,000
Medic.

1350
00:53:37,000 --> 00:53:37,000
Ah.

1351
00:53:40,000 --> 00:53:41,000
Oh, man.

1352
00:53:44,000 --> 00:53:45,000
I can't talk about.

1353
00:53:45,000 --> 00:53:47,000
Oh, that would have been cool if I had that go off.

1354
00:53:50,000 --> 00:53:52,000
Just get the telephone in the toilet here about.

1355
00:53:54,000 --> 00:53:56,000
You should be on the winning team now, maybe.

1356
00:53:57,000 --> 00:53:58,000
Don't hit my medic, you bastards.

1357
00:53:59,000 --> 00:54:01,000
I can't believe they haven't turned around.

1358
00:54:01,000 --> 00:54:02,000
How?

1359
00:54:02,000 --> 00:54:04,000
I just did two crits and I'm hitting my own teammate.

1360
00:54:04,000 --> 00:54:06,000
What the hell is going on?

1361
00:54:07,000 --> 00:54:11,000
Dude, I just planted it like six hits into this guy.

1362
00:54:11,000 --> 00:54:12,000
Holy crap.

1363
00:54:13,000 --> 00:54:14,000
That was ridiculous.

1364
00:54:14,000 --> 00:54:15,000
I've never seen that happen before.

1365
00:54:17,000 --> 00:54:19,000
Both hammering on the same guy.

1366
00:54:19,000 --> 00:54:19,000
Oh, guys.

1367
00:54:20,000 --> 00:54:21,000
Oh, we got a crit screen now.

1368
00:54:21,000 --> 00:54:22,000
Ready to crit screen now.

1369
00:54:22,000 --> 00:54:22,000
Oh, man.

1370
00:54:26,000 --> 00:54:28,000
Oh, there's four demo man.

1371
00:54:28,000 --> 00:54:29,000
Demo men.

1372
00:54:29,000 --> 00:54:30,000
I think no wonder.

1373
00:54:30,000 --> 00:54:32,000
I just like save that demo man's life.

1374
00:54:32,000 --> 00:54:33,000
But not really.

1375
00:54:34,000 --> 00:54:35,000
All right, push it.

1376
00:54:35,000 --> 00:54:35,000
Push it.

1377
00:54:39,000 --> 00:54:40,000
Oh, push it.

1378
00:54:41,000 --> 00:54:41,000
No.

1379
00:54:42,000 --> 00:54:43,000
No.

1380
00:54:45,000 --> 00:54:46,000
This is a really bad idea.

1381
00:54:46,000 --> 00:54:47,000
I just ran around to spawn.

1382
00:54:48,000 --> 00:54:49,000
Maybe not.

1383
00:54:49,000 --> 00:54:50,000
Come on.

1384
00:54:50,000 --> 00:54:50,000
Come on.

1385
00:54:51,000 --> 00:54:52,000
Oh, come on.

1386
00:54:55,000 --> 00:54:59,000
Oh, that is a sad face indeed.

1387
00:55:00,000 --> 00:55:02,000
That is a sad face indeed.

1388
00:55:04,000 --> 00:55:06,000
Could have had an explosion kill.

1389
00:55:07,000 --> 00:55:08,000
Could have what a shut up.

1390
00:55:08,000 --> 00:55:09,000
What it didn't have.

1391
00:55:11,000 --> 00:55:11,000
I'm trying my hand.

1392
00:55:11,000 --> 00:55:13,000
Oh, you guys are about to win.

1393
00:55:13,000 --> 00:55:16,000
You got like three pyros back here.

1394
00:55:16,000 --> 00:55:18,000
Just camping our spawn hard core.

1395
00:55:18,000 --> 00:55:18,000
Really?

1396
00:55:19,000 --> 00:55:19,000
Oh, man.

1397
00:55:19,000 --> 00:55:20,000
Never run.

1398
00:55:20,000 --> 00:55:20,000
Yeah.

1399
00:55:21,000 --> 00:55:21,000
Cool.

1400
00:55:23,000 --> 00:55:25,000
Let's do some crazy rocket jumps.

1401
00:55:26,000 --> 00:55:27,000
Here we come.

1402
00:55:27,000 --> 00:55:27,000
Rocket jumps.

1403
00:55:27,000 --> 00:55:28,000
I think I got like one kill.

1404
00:55:29,000 --> 00:55:31,000
Dude, I've been doing I've been doing job maps.

1405
00:55:31,000 --> 00:55:31,000
See we go.

1406
00:55:35,000 --> 00:55:36,000
I did some jump.

1407
00:55:36,000 --> 00:55:37,000
Perhaps I know what I'm doing.

1408
00:55:37,000 --> 00:55:38,000
All right.

1409
00:55:38,000 --> 00:55:40,000
Somebody in the street said,

1410
00:55:40,000 --> 00:55:42,000
Jerma plays, play tribes of Sint.

1411
00:55:42,000 --> 00:55:43,000
That's what they said.

1412
00:55:43,000 --> 00:55:44,000
I'm not making that up.

1413
00:55:45,000 --> 00:55:46,000
Um, I see.

1414
00:55:46,000 --> 00:55:46,000
I see.

1415
00:55:46,000 --> 00:55:47,000
I see people say that.

1416
00:55:47,000 --> 00:55:47,000
Um,

1417
00:55:48,000 --> 00:55:50,000
what CS goal just had a big,

1418
00:55:50,000 --> 00:55:52,000
huge, crazy update.

1419
00:55:52,000 --> 00:55:53,000
I want to check that.

1420
00:55:53,000 --> 00:55:54,000
It's fine.

1421
00:55:54,000 --> 00:55:56,000
But to answer your questions in the comments,

1422
00:55:56,000 --> 00:55:57,000
tribes of Sint is free to play.

1423
00:55:57,000 --> 00:55:58,000
So.

1424
00:55:58,000 --> 00:55:59,000
It is.

1425
00:55:59,000 --> 00:56:01,000
And it's now totally open.

1426
00:56:01,000 --> 00:56:02,000
It's not in beta anymore.

1427
00:56:02,000 --> 00:56:03,000
It is out now.

1428
00:56:03,000 --> 00:56:04,000
Yeah, it's out.

1429
00:56:04,000 --> 00:56:05,000
It's been released.

1430
00:56:05,000 --> 00:56:06,000
It is fun.

1431
00:56:06,000 --> 00:56:07,000
So that's, uh,

1432
00:56:07,000 --> 00:56:10,000
I'm going to move on from TF2 now.

1433
00:56:10,000 --> 00:56:11,000
Played about an hour at TF2.

1434
00:56:12,000 --> 00:56:13,000
So before I go, I have to do something.

1435
00:56:13,000 --> 00:56:14,000
Sounds good.

1436
00:56:14,000 --> 00:56:15,000
I have to do something just stupid.

1437
00:56:15,000 --> 00:56:16,000
And just TF2.

1438
00:56:16,000 --> 00:56:17,000
Here we go.

1439
00:56:17,000 --> 00:56:18,000
Let's go, uh, place, fry.

1440
00:56:19,000 --> 00:56:21,000
And I'm going to just,

1441
00:56:21,000 --> 00:56:22,000
this is this is the goal here, guys.

1442
00:56:22,000 --> 00:56:25,000
The goal is to try

1443
00:56:26,000 --> 00:56:27,000
and blend in with the other team.

1444
00:56:28,000 --> 00:56:31,000
So it's going to be hard to people, people are watching the stream.

1445
00:56:31,000 --> 00:56:32,000
But this could be interesting.

1446
00:56:32,000 --> 00:56:33,000
I want to try doing this at least once.

1447
00:56:35,000 --> 00:56:38,000
Why is there a floating scout stuff here?

1448
00:56:41,000 --> 00:56:42,000
Oh no, I'm just the high five.

1449
00:56:43,000 --> 00:56:45,000
So the, the goal here is to try and blend in.

1450
00:56:45,000 --> 00:56:46,000
Let's see how well I do.

1451
00:56:50,000 --> 00:56:52,000
Let's see how well I do here.

1452
00:56:52,000 --> 00:56:53,000
All right.

1453
00:56:56,000 --> 00:56:57,000
We're going to stop them.

1454
00:56:59,000 --> 00:57:00,000
Come on, get them.

1455
00:57:02,000 --> 00:57:03,000
Oh my god, they're coming.

1456
00:57:03,000 --> 00:57:05,000
The car is upside down.

1457
00:57:05,000 --> 00:57:07,000
What the hell is going on with that car?

1458
00:57:07,000 --> 00:57:08,000
It is a thing.

1459
00:57:08,000 --> 00:57:09,000
Come on, we must get them.

1460
00:57:10,000 --> 00:57:10,000
All right.

1461
00:57:11,000 --> 00:57:12,000
Oh no, here they come.

1462
00:57:12,000 --> 00:57:14,000
They're coming out of the right door now.

1463
00:57:14,000 --> 00:57:14,000
Blue team.

1464
00:57:14,000 --> 00:57:15,000
That's, no.

1465
00:57:15,000 --> 00:57:17,000
I'm going to, oh, you figure me out.

1466
00:57:22,000 --> 00:57:24,000
That guy, no, he didn't see me.

1467
00:57:24,000 --> 00:57:26,000
Okay, I'm just going to build my stuff right here.

1468
00:57:27,000 --> 00:57:28,000
Just going to build some stuff.

1469
00:57:28,000 --> 00:57:31,000
I'm trying to build my, uh, my teleporter in my century.

1470
00:57:31,000 --> 00:57:32,000
It's all good stuff.

1471
00:57:32,000 --> 00:57:34,000
Let me just, uh, build that up.

1472
00:57:34,000 --> 00:57:36,000
Thank you for the overhealed by the way.

1473
00:57:36,000 --> 00:57:37,000
Oh, I'm a fake.

1474
00:57:38,000 --> 00:57:39,000
Oh my god.

1475
00:57:41,000 --> 00:57:41,000
It's got, yeah.

1476
00:57:43,000 --> 00:57:43,000
I got you.

1477
00:57:43,000 --> 00:57:44,000
Oh my god.

1478
00:57:47,000 --> 00:57:49,000
Oh, I'm, oh, I'm going to get back to my post.

1479
00:57:49,000 --> 00:57:53,000
These bastards, they ruined everything.

1480
00:57:53,000 --> 00:57:55,000
No, please don't take it.

1481
00:57:55,000 --> 00:57:55,000
He's taking it.

1482
00:57:55,000 --> 00:57:57,000
Oh my god.

1483
00:57:57,000 --> 00:57:59,000
I got, I got, I got to get back to my century.

1484
00:57:59,000 --> 00:58:01,000
We're going to, I got to build my century.

1485
00:58:01,000 --> 00:58:02,000
Oh, that is, that's me right there.

1486
00:58:02,000 --> 00:58:03,000
Okay, cool.

1487
00:58:03,000 --> 00:58:05,000
Uh, sniper.

1488
00:58:05,000 --> 00:58:07,000
And there we go.

1489
00:58:07,000 --> 00:58:08,000
I'm going to snipe.

1490
00:58:08,000 --> 00:58:09,000
All right.

1491
00:58:09,000 --> 00:58:11,000
Let me get back to my sniping post.

1492
00:58:11,000 --> 00:58:13,000
All right.

1493
00:58:13,000 --> 00:58:14,000
Here we go.

1494
00:58:14,000 --> 00:58:15,000
Just sniping.

1495
00:58:15,000 --> 00:58:17,000
Now the enemy team is coming out here.

1496
00:58:17,000 --> 00:58:18,000
Watch out, guys.

1497
00:58:18,000 --> 00:58:19,000
Be careful.

1498
00:58:19,000 --> 00:58:20,000
Now let me snipe with you.

1499
00:58:23,000 --> 00:58:24,000
Oh god.

1500
00:58:24,000 --> 00:58:25,000
Who's the real one?

1501
00:58:25,000 --> 00:58:26,000
We're standing right next to each other.

1502
00:58:26,000 --> 00:58:27,000
Oh, you got me.

1503
00:58:27,000 --> 00:58:27,000
Shit.

1504
00:58:29,000 --> 00:58:31,000
Oh, you ruined my fun.

1505
00:58:32,000 --> 00:58:34,000
That's when I get angry and die.

1506
00:58:38,000 --> 00:58:39,000
Oh, all right.

1507
00:58:39,000 --> 00:58:41,000
That's, uh, that's going to be, actually,

1508
00:58:41,000 --> 00:58:43,000
I'll run the roundout.

1509
00:58:43,000 --> 00:58:43,000
Why not?

1510
00:58:45,000 --> 00:58:46,000
Why not?

1511
00:58:46,000 --> 00:58:48,000
Disguise as an enemy sniper.

1512
00:58:48,000 --> 00:58:49,000
That's the best way to do it.

1513
00:58:50,000 --> 00:58:52,000
And then just sit in the corner and be like,

1514
00:58:52,000 --> 00:58:52,000
oh, sniper.

1515
00:58:56,000 --> 00:58:58,000
I was trying to get the three hits,

1516
00:58:59,000 --> 00:59:01,000
crit with the gun slinger.

1517
00:59:01,000 --> 00:59:02,000
Almost got it.

1518
00:59:02,000 --> 00:59:04,000
Uh, it's really satisfying.

1519
00:59:06,000 --> 00:59:07,000
Oh, damn it.

1520
00:59:07,000 --> 00:59:09,000
Oh, he didn't get me.

1521
00:59:09,000 --> 00:59:09,000
Uh-huh.

1522
00:59:09,000 --> 00:59:10,000
Uh-huh.

1523
00:59:11,000 --> 00:59:11,000
Oh.

1524
00:59:12,000 --> 00:59:13,000
Come on.

1525
00:59:13,000 --> 00:59:13,000
Come on.

1526
00:59:13,000 --> 00:59:14,000
No.

1527
00:59:14,000 --> 00:59:14,000
No.

1528
00:59:14,000 --> 00:59:14,000
Okay, good.

1529
00:59:14,000 --> 00:59:15,000
Good.

1530
00:59:15,000 --> 00:59:15,000
Good.

1531
00:59:16,000 --> 00:59:17,000
All right, let me get my sniping skills.

1532
00:59:19,000 --> 00:59:20,000
I found an ambassador.

1533
00:59:21,000 --> 00:59:23,000
I-I still haven't been fortunate.

1534
00:59:23,000 --> 00:59:24,000
Really difficult.

1535
00:59:24,000 --> 00:59:24,000
Oh, come on.

1536
00:59:27,000 --> 00:59:28,000
I'm just trying to snipe.

1537
00:59:30,000 --> 00:59:31,000
All right, if you guys don't stop spamming chat

1538
00:59:31,000 --> 00:59:33,000
and most are blocking some people.

1539
00:59:34,000 --> 00:59:35,000
No, they got it.

1540
00:59:35,000 --> 00:59:37,000
They found me out again.

1541
00:59:38,000 --> 00:59:40,000
Oh, we get the- the wrath of the mod coming down.

1542
00:59:40,000 --> 00:59:42,000
Ha-ha-ha.

1543
00:59:45,000 --> 00:59:45,000
Oh.

1544
00:59:48,000 --> 00:59:49,000
All right, this is my last life.

1545
00:59:49,000 --> 00:59:50,000
Then I'm moving on to uh,

1546
00:59:51,000 --> 00:59:52,000
counter,

1547
00:59:53,000 --> 00:59:53,000
Stephenson.

1548
00:59:54,000 --> 00:59:55,000
Great opportunity.

1549
00:59:58,000 --> 00:59:59,000
Backstab.

1550
01:00:00,000 --> 01:00:02,000
I'm gonna tell you how- yeah, I'm taking the teleporter as a spy.

1551
01:00:03,000 --> 01:00:05,000
At level two, I'm a real bad bastard.

1552
01:00:05,000 --> 01:00:06,000
I'm a real bastard.

1553
01:00:06,000 --> 01:00:06,000
Look at this.

1554
01:00:07,000 --> 01:00:08,000
Level two teleporter.

1555
01:00:08,000 --> 01:00:09,000
And I'm taking it as a spy.

1556
01:00:09,000 --> 01:00:10,000
What a jerk.

1557
01:00:13,000 --> 01:00:16,000
I wonder if I can uh, just kill people up from up here.

1558
01:00:17,000 --> 01:00:18,000
Oh, for the love of God.

1559
01:00:19,000 --> 01:00:20,000
I just can't get the melee.

1560
01:00:23,000 --> 01:00:24,000
Oh.

1561
01:00:25,000 --> 01:00:26,000
Well, that's the last one.

1562
01:00:26,000 --> 01:00:27,000
Like the worst engineer ever.

1563
01:00:29,000 --> 01:00:31,000
How come I can't spray my spray?

1564
01:00:31,000 --> 01:00:32,000
That's not cool.

1565
01:00:33,000 --> 01:00:35,000
Like, yeah, I don't have a spray.

1566
01:00:35,000 --> 01:00:36,000
I need to- I need a cool one.

1567
01:00:37,000 --> 01:00:40,000
I am going to change to saw CS go.

1568
01:00:40,000 --> 01:00:43,000
After I swing it this guy over and over again.

1569
01:00:43,000 --> 01:00:44,000
Oh, oh.

1570
01:00:44,000 --> 01:00:45,000
So always one more life.

1571
01:00:45,000 --> 01:00:47,000
Yeah, this is really the last life.

1572
01:00:47,000 --> 01:00:49,000
I'm not- this is not a joke.

1573
01:00:49,000 --> 01:00:50,000
No more- no jokes.

1574
01:00:50,000 --> 01:00:51,000
This is the last one.

1575
01:00:51,000 --> 01:00:51,000
Yeah.

1576
01:00:51,000 --> 01:00:53,000
I have to backstab at least one person.

1577
01:00:53,000 --> 01:00:55,000
And that's not the guy apparently.

1578
01:00:57,000 --> 01:00:59,000
And that's not the guy either.

1579
01:00:59,000 --> 01:01:00,000
It's gonna be not that guy.

1580
01:01:00,000 --> 01:01:01,000
It's what?

1581
01:01:01,000 --> 01:01:02,000
What?

1582
01:01:02,000 --> 01:01:02,000
What?

1583
01:01:02,000 --> 01:01:02,000
What?

1584
01:01:02,000 --> 01:01:03,000
What?

1585
01:01:03,000 --> 01:01:03,000
What?

1586
01:01:03,000 --> 01:01:04,000
What?

1587
01:01:05,000 --> 01:01:07,000
Now I can't backstab anybody.

1588
01:01:07,000 --> 01:01:09,000
Oh, minus will pretend.

1589
01:01:09,000 --> 01:01:12,000
Oh, let me do that pretender I am.

1590
01:01:12,000 --> 01:01:15,000
Come on, get that knife out.

1591
01:01:15,000 --> 01:01:17,000
Oh, my God.

1592
01:01:17,000 --> 01:01:22,000
Well, that's the end for me.

1593
01:01:22,000 --> 01:01:25,000
Oh, thanks for playing guys.

1594
01:01:25,000 --> 01:01:25,000
TF2.

1595
01:01:25,000 --> 01:01:27,000
I'm gonna move on to some-

1596
01:01:27,000 --> 01:01:28,000
Yep, it's a go-go.

1597
01:01:28,000 --> 01:01:32,000
You're full of fun losing every round.

1598
01:01:33,000 --> 01:01:34,000
I'm the only comment denominator here,

1599
01:01:34,000 --> 01:01:36,000
so I take full responsibility for that.

1600
01:01:38,000 --> 01:01:40,000
I've been on every losing team so far.

1601
01:01:43,000 --> 01:01:44,000
My bad guys, my bad.

1602
01:01:45,000 --> 01:01:46,000
Well, at least-

1603
01:01:47,000 --> 01:01:53,000
at least you got to play on the crazy teams that were getting beat.

1604
01:01:55,000 --> 01:01:56,000
Oh, my goodness.

1605
01:01:56,000 --> 01:01:57,000
That- what's- you were reaching for that one.

1606
01:01:57,000 --> 01:01:58,000
That really was.

1607
01:01:58,000 --> 01:01:59,000
Actually, I was doing two things at once.

1608
01:01:59,000 --> 01:02:01,000
And my brain was kind of like, wait, where am I?

1609
01:02:01,000 --> 01:02:03,000
Oh, yeah, I'm streaming, I forgot.

1610
01:02:04,000 --> 01:02:07,000
So I'll probably play like maybe three, two or three rounds of CS go.

1611
01:02:07,000 --> 01:02:09,000
Just to check out the new update, because I wanted to check it out.

1612
01:02:10,000 --> 01:02:13,000
So screen is going to go black in a second here.

1613
01:02:14,000 --> 01:02:15,000
And yeah, thank you for coming.

1614
01:02:15,000 --> 01:02:17,000
If you just came for the TF2.

1615
01:02:17,000 --> 01:02:19,000
If you're sticking around with the CS go,

1616
01:02:19,000 --> 01:02:21,000
then it's gonna happen in like four seconds.

1617
01:02:21,000 --> 01:02:23,000
Well, not really, but you get the idea.

1618
01:02:23,000 --> 01:02:27,000
Screen is gonna go black in second.

1619
01:02:32,000 --> 01:02:33,000
Screen is totally not black, bro.

1620
01:02:33,000 --> 01:02:35,000
Oh, no, there it goes.

1621
01:02:35,000 --> 01:02:35,000
No, it's black.

1622
01:02:36,000 --> 01:02:37,000
No, it's not.

1623
01:02:39,000 --> 01:02:41,000
No, it's- oh, no, that's wrong, because I did screen region.

1624
01:02:42,000 --> 01:02:43,000
I pulled up the screen region.

1625
01:02:47,000 --> 01:02:48,000
Now it should be all screwed up.

1626
01:02:48,000 --> 01:02:49,000
Probably hear the sound now.

1627
01:02:52,000 --> 01:02:53,000
Get it into window mode.

1628
01:02:53,000 --> 01:02:54,000
Oh.

1629
01:02:57,000 --> 01:02:58,000
Jeez, okay.

1630
01:02:58,000 --> 01:03:00,000
Anyway, guys, it's been fun.

1631
01:03:00,000 --> 01:03:02,000
Thanks for owning me time and time again.

1632
01:03:04,000 --> 01:03:05,000
How I get my kicks.

1633
01:03:07,000 --> 01:03:07,000
Well, I'm just kidding.

1634
01:03:07,000 --> 01:03:08,000
It was a lot of fun.

1635
01:03:09,000 --> 01:03:11,000
And enjoy CS go.

1636
01:03:11,000 --> 01:03:13,000
I will catch you guys later.

1637
01:03:13,000 --> 01:03:14,000
Thanks for coming, man.

1638
01:03:14,000 --> 01:03:15,000
Always a pleasure.

1639
01:03:21,000 --> 01:03:23,000
Let's get this screen in a region.

1640
01:03:24,000 --> 01:03:25,000
That.

1641
01:03:27,000 --> 01:03:28,000
And, huh.

1642
01:03:29,000 --> 01:03:30,000
Okay.

1643
01:03:30,000 --> 01:03:31,000
Let's play a couple rounds.

1644
01:03:31,000 --> 01:03:32,000
Let's see what they did.

1645
01:03:32,000 --> 01:03:33,000
Huge updates.

1646
01:03:33,000 --> 01:03:35,000
Let's find out exactly what they did.

1647
01:03:36,000 --> 01:03:37,000
Didn't this update?

1648
01:03:41,000 --> 01:03:43,000
Have I ever- I've- I've- I've watched South Park.

1649
01:03:44,000 --> 01:03:47,000
I used to love South Park back in the day.

1650
01:03:47,000 --> 01:03:48,000
That's one of my favorite shows.

1651
01:03:53,000 --> 01:03:55,000
Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha.

1652
01:03:57,000 --> 01:03:58,000
That's right.

1653
01:03:58,000 --> 01:03:59,000
They did add a server bracket.

1654
01:03:59,000 --> 01:03:59,000
I gotta check that out.

1655
01:04:03,000 --> 01:04:04,000
If I can even get in here.

1656
01:04:07,000 --> 01:04:08,000
Still searching, huh.

1657
01:04:10,000 --> 01:04:11,000
Let's try this again.

1658
01:04:13,000 --> 01:04:13,000
Find the game.

1659
01:04:16,000 --> 01:04:17,000
Oh, look at that.

1660
01:04:20,000 --> 01:04:21,000
There we go.

1661
01:04:24,000 --> 01:04:25,000
Retrieving data.

1662
01:04:29,000 --> 01:04:33,000
Yeah, I'm probably only gonna play maybe two or three rounds.

1663
01:04:33,000 --> 01:04:34,000
Maybe 10, 20 minutes or so.

1664
01:04:34,000 --> 01:04:36,000
I just want to check out the new update in the honest.

1665
01:04:38,000 --> 01:04:40,000
Okay, so this is the new map.

1666
01:04:40,000 --> 01:04:40,000
No, maybe not.

1667
01:04:40,000 --> 01:04:41,000
This is not one of the new maps.

1668
01:04:41,000 --> 01:04:42,000
Is it?

1669
01:04:42,000 --> 01:04:43,000
I think I've already seen it.

1670
01:04:43,000 --> 01:04:43,000
I've already seen it.

1671
01:04:43,000 --> 01:04:44,000
No, maybe not.

1672
01:04:45,000 --> 01:04:47,000
Maybe it is a different map.

1673
01:04:49,000 --> 01:04:50,000
We'll find out, won't we?

1674
01:04:54,000 --> 01:04:56,000
Oh, I'm trying to pick up a headshot.

1675
01:04:56,000 --> 01:04:57,000
Damn.

1676
01:04:59,000 --> 01:05:01,000
So this is one of the new maps, safehouse.

1677
01:05:03,000 --> 01:05:04,000
They're already using another one like this, isn't there?

1678
01:05:12,000 --> 01:05:13,000
This game is not free to play.

1679
01:05:13,000 --> 01:05:15,000
It is in beta right now.

1680
01:05:17,000 --> 01:05:18,000
It's in closed beta.

1681
01:05:19,000 --> 01:05:19,000
Yeah.

1682
01:05:22,000 --> 01:05:23,000
All right, I'm gonna stay alive next time.

1683
01:05:24,000 --> 01:05:25,000
The most growing around.

1684
01:05:27,000 --> 01:05:28,000
And the tower was one.

1685
01:05:30,000 --> 01:05:31,000
Will they be punch and pie?

1686
01:05:33,000 --> 01:05:34,000
So you know what?

1687
01:05:34,000 --> 01:05:35,000
I can't, we can't buy.

1688
01:05:36,000 --> 01:05:38,000
Why can we not buy items?

1689
01:05:38,000 --> 01:05:40,000
I thought that's what it said you could do.

1690
01:05:43,000 --> 01:05:44,000
I'm gonna go around this way.

1691
01:05:44,000 --> 01:05:48,000
Let's see if I can pull something off here.

1692
01:05:48,000 --> 01:05:49,000
No, I don't want to climb up there.

1693
01:05:49,000 --> 01:05:50,000
That's a bad idea.

1694
01:05:54,000 --> 01:05:55,000
No, I just saw somebody.

1695
01:05:56,000 --> 01:05:57,000
There we go.

1696
01:05:59,000 --> 01:06:00,000
Oh, I'm dead.

1697
01:06:03,000 --> 01:06:03,000
Nope.

1698
01:06:04,000 --> 01:06:05,000
Nope.

1699
01:06:06,000 --> 01:06:07,000
Oh, God.

1700
01:06:08,000 --> 01:06:09,000
Behind me.

1701
01:06:09,000 --> 01:06:09,000
He's behind me.

1702
01:06:12,000 --> 01:06:12,000
He's down.

1703
01:06:12,000 --> 01:06:13,000
Bomb's down here.

1704
01:06:14,000 --> 01:06:16,000
What you got?

1705
01:06:16,000 --> 01:06:19,000
It's only one of them left.

1706
01:06:23,000 --> 01:06:24,000
No, that's a teammate.

1707
01:06:26,000 --> 01:06:26,000
There he is.

1708
01:06:28,000 --> 01:06:30,000
Henderson incorporated, but most eliminations.

1709
01:06:34,000 --> 01:06:36,000
I forgot my name was Henderson incorporated.

1710
01:06:38,000 --> 01:06:39,000
The clickety-clack.

1711
01:06:39,000 --> 01:06:42,000
Now this game will do that.

1712
01:06:42,000 --> 01:06:44,000
You'll get a big clickety-clack.

1713
01:06:47,000 --> 01:06:48,000
I'm waiting for somebody to pop there.

1714
01:06:48,000 --> 01:06:49,000
I have any grades.

1715
01:06:53,000 --> 01:06:54,000
No, nobody, nobody.

1716
01:06:54,000 --> 01:06:54,000
Oh, my God.

1717
01:06:54,000 --> 01:06:55,000
I'm getting stuck.

1718
01:06:55,000 --> 01:06:55,000
Getting stuck.

1719
01:06:59,000 --> 01:06:59,000
He's right here.

1720
01:07:00,000 --> 01:07:01,000
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

1721
01:07:01,000 --> 01:07:02,000
Let's live a-

1722
01:07:03,000 --> 01:07:04,000
You guys hanging out of a window.

1723
01:07:05,000 --> 01:07:05,000
What a creep.

1724
01:07:06,000 --> 01:07:11,000
A guy was legit like floating out of the window.

1725
01:07:11,000 --> 01:07:15,000
I want to do a different gun.

1726
01:07:15,000 --> 01:07:15,000
I don't like this gun.

1727
01:07:15,000 --> 01:07:19,000
Auto is upstairs right now.

1728
01:07:19,000 --> 01:07:23,000
He is, uh, I think he's created in the kitchen, in the honest.

1729
01:07:23,000 --> 01:07:26,000
Because he's, uh, he's a wild dog.

1730
01:07:30,000 --> 01:07:34,000
Somebody kill somebody.

1731
01:07:35,000 --> 01:07:37,000
Who's auto?

1732
01:07:39,000 --> 01:07:43,000
Auto is my, uh, my little doxan chihuahua

1733
01:07:43,000 --> 01:07:44,000
double-man-pinter breed thing.

1734
01:07:45,000 --> 01:07:46,000
He's a real cutie.

1735
01:07:48,000 --> 01:07:49,000
He's a real cutie.

1736
01:07:51,000 --> 01:07:53,000
I don't play League of Legends.

1737
01:07:53,000 --> 01:07:55,000
It's too much for my brain to handle.

1738
01:07:57,000 --> 01:08:00,000
I feel the same way about League as I do about Starcraft.

1739
01:08:00,000 --> 01:08:03,000
And that is, this already damn it.

1740
01:08:03,000 --> 01:08:05,000
Oh, now I got to sit here forever.

1741
01:08:06,000 --> 01:08:09,000
I feel the same way about League as I do Starcraft.

1742
01:08:09,000 --> 01:08:10,000
The Starcraft is,

1743
01:08:12,000 --> 01:08:13,000
it's everyone's just really, really good.

1744
01:08:14,000 --> 01:08:17,000
And to be able to play that game,

1745
01:08:17,000 --> 01:08:18,000
you have to also be really, really good.

1746
01:08:20,000 --> 01:08:22,000
Yeah, I probably won't be playing that game anytime soon.

1747
01:08:27,000 --> 01:08:30,000
Well, this is, I don't want to just sit here.

1748
01:08:30,000 --> 01:08:32,000
I'm going to play a gun game after next round.

1749
01:08:33,000 --> 01:08:35,000
Because gun game is more action.

1750
01:08:36,000 --> 01:08:38,000
And I can actually pretty good at gun game.

1751
01:08:40,000 --> 01:08:43,000
See, this game won't, I'm not that good at,

1752
01:08:43,000 --> 01:08:46,000
like the general CSGO, I'm not that good at it.

1753
01:08:46,000 --> 01:08:47,000
You know, we're going to go play gun game right now.

1754
01:08:49,000 --> 01:08:50,000
It's a tomato game.

1755
01:08:53,000 --> 01:08:54,000
Find a game.

1756
01:08:54,000 --> 01:08:55,000
Arms race.

1757
01:08:56,000 --> 01:08:57,000
You don't matter which one, that's going to play it.

1758
01:08:58,000 --> 01:09:04,000
It's not gun game.

1759
01:09:06,000 --> 01:09:07,000
It sure is.

1760
01:09:12,000 --> 01:09:13,000
Gun game.

1761
01:09:13,000 --> 01:09:14,000
Gun game.

1762
01:09:17,000 --> 01:09:21,000
Oh, I mean, arms race is the technical term for it.

1763
01:09:21,000 --> 01:09:28,000
I love this map.

1764
01:09:28,000 --> 01:09:29,000
It's so interesting.

1765
01:09:33,000 --> 01:09:35,000
You heard it like, oh, I love the girl's man.

1766
01:09:36,000 --> 01:09:37,000
Favorite bands, by far.

1767
01:09:41,000 --> 01:09:42,000
From behind.

1768
01:09:42,000 --> 01:09:42,000
Ah.

1769
01:09:44,000 --> 01:09:45,000
He's right here.

1770
01:09:48,000 --> 01:09:50,000
Finally, moving on, moving on to the world.

1771
01:09:52,000 --> 01:09:52,000
Now where is he?

1772
01:09:56,000 --> 01:09:57,000
Oh, there's too many of them.

1773
01:10:05,000 --> 01:10:06,000
Damn it.

1774
01:10:12,000 --> 01:10:15,000
Yeah, keep in mind, I'm playing this in a window,

1775
01:10:15,000 --> 01:10:17,000
like half the size of my computer screen.

1776
01:10:17,000 --> 01:10:19,000
So it can be kind of difficult to play this game.

1777
01:10:22,000 --> 01:10:23,000
How many?

1778
01:10:23,000 --> 01:10:24,000
Bolks, does it take?

1779
01:10:30,000 --> 01:10:31,000
No, I don't want to do that.

1780
01:10:32,000 --> 01:10:33,000
Oh.

1781
01:10:39,000 --> 01:10:40,000
Wait, I got...

1782
01:10:44,000 --> 01:10:45,000
Oh, damn.

1783
01:10:45,000 --> 01:10:46,000
Yeah.

1784
01:10:49,000 --> 01:10:54,000
Yeah, I wish my computer was good enough to play games in full screen and stream them.

1785
01:10:54,000 --> 01:10:57,000
But it is almost impossible to do that.

1786
01:10:58,000 --> 01:10:59,000
And I am getting destroyed.

1787
01:11:01,000 --> 01:11:04,000
My god, the whole team is like 18 and 14 and...

1788
01:11:13,000 --> 01:11:13,000
I'm going this way.

1789
01:11:13,000 --> 01:11:14,000
I'm going this way.

1790
01:11:16,000 --> 01:11:22,000
Get out of town.

1791
01:11:24,000 --> 01:11:25,000
Damn it.

1792
01:11:32,000 --> 01:11:33,000
Hmm.

1793
01:11:36,000 --> 01:11:37,000
Give me that headshot.

1794
01:11:37,000 --> 01:11:38,000
God damn.

1795
01:11:39,000 --> 01:11:41,000
Yeah, it's not my internet.

1796
01:11:41,000 --> 01:11:44,000
It's my computer just probably would not be able to handle it.

1797
01:11:44,000 --> 01:11:45,000
And I guess internet too.

1798
01:11:46,000 --> 01:11:50,000
To stream at like 1080 or 720, it takes a lot of bandwidth.

1799
01:12:02,000 --> 01:12:03,000
Oh, what was I doing?

1800
01:12:04,000 --> 01:12:09,000
This potentially is the worst time, like the worst game I've ever had in this entire game.

1801
01:12:09,000 --> 01:12:09,000
Ever.

1802
01:12:10,000 --> 01:12:11,000
Like ever.

1803
01:12:12,000 --> 01:12:12,000
Haha.

1804
01:12:14,000 --> 01:12:16,000
It's making me look embarrassed.

1805
01:12:16,000 --> 01:12:17,000
No, I don't care.

1806
01:12:17,000 --> 01:12:18,000
I'm just playing for fun.

1807
01:12:18,000 --> 01:12:19,000
I just want to check out the new stuff.

1808
01:12:21,000 --> 01:12:25,000
My favorite guerrillas song is probably Stylo.

1809
01:12:25,000 --> 01:12:26,000
I love Stylo.

1810
01:12:26,000 --> 01:12:27,000
Where is he?

1811
01:12:28,000 --> 01:12:29,000
I don't even know where that guy even was.

1812
01:12:38,000 --> 01:12:38,000
Ow.

1813
01:12:39,000 --> 01:12:40,000
Ow.

1814
01:12:42,000 --> 01:12:42,000
Oh.

1815
01:12:48,000 --> 01:12:50,000
Okay, let's get a string of people together here.

1816
01:12:52,000 --> 01:12:53,000
Let's get a string of people together.

1817
01:12:57,000 --> 01:12:58,000
Now somebody got it.

1818
01:13:01,000 --> 01:13:03,000
Oh, 715.

1819
01:13:03,000 --> 01:13:06,000
Flip that score around and you got a great score.

1820
01:13:08,000 --> 01:13:09,000
All right, this time it's going to be different.

1821
01:13:09,000 --> 01:13:11,000
You need to pray to the Bruins.

1822
01:13:13,000 --> 01:13:15,000
All powerful Bruins, gods.

1823
01:13:17,000 --> 01:13:19,000
Please shine upon me your strength.

1824
01:13:21,000 --> 01:13:23,000
I've got my sensitivity might be wrong.

1825
01:13:23,000 --> 01:13:25,000
No, it's not.

1826
01:13:25,000 --> 01:13:27,000
That's an excuse.

1827
01:13:29,000 --> 01:13:31,000
I'm going to get a string of people.

1828
01:13:31,000 --> 01:13:33,000
I'm going to get a string of people.

1829
01:13:33,000 --> 01:13:35,000
I'm going to get a string of people.

1830
01:13:35,000 --> 01:13:37,000
I'm going to get a string of people.

1831
01:13:38,000 --> 01:13:40,000
That is just an excuse.

1832
01:13:42,000 --> 01:13:43,000
There we go.

1833
01:13:43,000 --> 01:13:45,000
Let's keep the ball rolling here.

1834
01:13:51,000 --> 01:13:53,000
We got it.

1835
01:13:55,000 --> 01:13:57,000
Mercy up top.

1836
01:13:57,000 --> 01:13:59,000
Oh boy.

1837
01:13:59,000 --> 01:14:01,000
Now get away.

1838
01:14:03,000 --> 01:14:05,000
Get away.

1839
01:14:06,000 --> 01:14:07,000
Oh damn.

1840
01:14:07,000 --> 01:14:09,000
Wow, where did he come from?

1841
01:14:12,000 --> 01:14:14,000
Where did that do with it come from?

1842
01:14:17,000 --> 01:14:19,000
Ah, going for the headshots.

1843
01:14:19,000 --> 01:14:21,000
Not getting them.

1844
01:14:21,000 --> 01:14:23,000
Not getting them.

1845
01:14:23,000 --> 01:14:25,000
Oh, no.

1846
01:14:33,000 --> 01:14:35,000
There we go.

1847
01:14:35,000 --> 01:14:37,000
Ah.

1848
01:14:39,000 --> 01:14:41,000
PP90M1.

1849
01:14:41,000 --> 01:14:43,000
I think that's what I just had.

1850
01:14:45,000 --> 01:14:47,000
This is the shoot guns.

1851
01:14:47,000 --> 01:14:49,000
Oh, now I can't go that way.

1852
01:14:49,000 --> 01:14:51,000
I'm going to wrap around this way.

1853
01:14:53,000 --> 01:14:57,000
Oh, how does he not die?

1854
01:14:57,000 --> 01:14:59,000
Look at his health.

1855
01:14:59,000 --> 01:15:01,000
What did I even hit him with?

1856
01:15:01,000 --> 01:15:03,000
Like a sock?

1857
01:15:03,000 --> 01:15:05,000
I don't know.

1858
01:15:05,000 --> 01:15:07,000
I don't understand.

1859
01:15:07,000 --> 01:15:09,000
That guy had like 80% health.

1860
01:15:09,000 --> 01:15:11,000
And I hit him with like a wet sock apparently.

1861
01:15:11,000 --> 01:15:13,000
Geez, my god.

1862
01:15:13,000 --> 01:15:15,000
That's insta death every single time.

1863
01:15:15,000 --> 01:15:17,000
No, no.

1864
01:15:17,000 --> 01:15:19,000
That guy was invincible.

1865
01:15:19,000 --> 01:15:21,000
How was that guy just invincible?

1866
01:15:21,000 --> 01:15:23,000
Somebody explained that to me.

1867
01:15:23,000 --> 01:15:25,000
That's not you.

1868
01:15:31,000 --> 01:15:33,000
There we go.

1869
01:15:33,000 --> 01:15:35,000
Get out of town.

1870
01:15:35,000 --> 01:15:37,000
No, no, I'm going to die.

1871
01:15:37,000 --> 01:15:39,000
Invincible.

1872
01:15:39,000 --> 01:15:41,000
Unpredictable.

1873
01:15:45,000 --> 01:15:47,000
Somebody up top?

1874
01:15:47,000 --> 01:15:49,000
Oh, see.

1875
01:15:49,000 --> 01:15:51,000
What the hell are you guys?

1876
01:15:55,000 --> 01:15:59,000
I just puked in my mouth.

1877
01:16:01,000 --> 01:16:05,000
Puked, puked, puked.

1878
01:16:09,000 --> 01:16:11,000
No.

1879
01:16:11,000 --> 01:16:13,000
How come I'm going to go across the map?

1880
01:16:13,000 --> 01:16:15,000
They just spawned over here.

1881
01:16:19,000 --> 01:16:23,000
Get my face in your face.

1882
01:16:27,000 --> 01:16:29,000
Get out of here.

1883
01:16:29,000 --> 01:16:31,000
Oh, come on.

1884
01:16:31,000 --> 01:16:33,000
This guy's 29 right now.

1885
01:16:33,000 --> 01:16:35,000
My god.

1886
01:16:39,000 --> 01:16:41,000
What?

1887
01:16:41,000 --> 01:16:43,000
Man.

1888
01:16:49,000 --> 01:16:51,000
That's too many of them.

1889
01:16:55,000 --> 01:16:57,000
I at least want to be number one on the team.

1890
01:17:01,000 --> 01:17:03,000
Ow.

1891
01:17:05,000 --> 01:17:07,000
Did it did it did it did it did it did it did it did it.

1892
01:17:09,000 --> 01:17:11,000
Stop puking.

1893
01:17:15,000 --> 01:17:17,000
That took a while.

1894
01:17:19,000 --> 01:17:21,000
Ow.

1895
01:17:21,000 --> 01:17:25,000
I at least want to go positive.

1896
01:17:25,000 --> 01:17:27,000
That's all I care about.

1897
01:17:27,000 --> 01:17:29,000
It's going positive.

1898
01:17:31,000 --> 01:17:35,000
Oh god, I'm being freaking out right now.

1899
01:17:35,000 --> 01:17:39,000
This guy's going to get a knife level in two seconds.

1900
01:17:41,000 --> 01:17:43,000
To me, it's gold.

1901
01:17:43,000 --> 01:17:45,000
Oh.

1902
01:17:47,000 --> 01:17:49,000
Oh.

1903
01:17:49,000 --> 01:17:53,000
Oh, it hurts to die in this game.

1904
01:18:01,000 --> 01:18:03,000
Where is everybody?

1905
01:18:05,000 --> 01:18:07,000
That did not kill that guy.

1906
01:18:07,000 --> 01:18:11,000
Oh my god, it's spawning right next to me.

1907
01:18:11,000 --> 01:18:13,000
Spawns are wacky in this game.

1908
01:18:13,000 --> 01:18:15,000
People just appear next to you.

1909
01:18:29,000 --> 01:18:31,000
What the heck.

1910
01:18:31,000 --> 01:18:35,000
Light machine guns.

1911
01:18:35,000 --> 01:18:37,000
Oh, come on.

1912
01:18:37,000 --> 01:18:39,000
No, somebody lost.

1913
01:18:39,000 --> 01:18:41,000
No, somebody lost.
