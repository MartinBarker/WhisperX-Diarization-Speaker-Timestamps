1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,000
Oh.

2
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:15,000
Hello.

3
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:18,000
Wee you.

4
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:25,000
An Nintendo Wii U.

5
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:27,000
Hey good uh.

6
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:32,000
Good evening everybody.

7
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:39,000
I turn uh I turn 30 in like eight minutes.

8
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:42,000
It's about 30.

9
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:54,000
I want to be I want to be 22 again when I was young and free.

10
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:56,000
And now whatever.

11
00:00:56,000 --> 00:01:05,000
So we're going to celebrate my 30th birthday prematurely by getting angry at a video game that I'm not good at.

12
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:08,000
Hey.

13
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:10,000
Sounds like a pretty good time to me.

14
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:20,000
What do you say?

15
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:23,000
And this time I actually have I put my monitor.

16
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:25,000
Well my other monitor.

17
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:27,000
It's over on like the right here.

18
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:31,000
So I should be able to see chat a lot better this time.

19
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:34,000
I moved my setup a little bit.

20
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:39,000
I'm uh currently transitioning into the experiment office.

21
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:41,000
Not quite 100% there.

22
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:44,000
I need to get a couch delivered here first for this downstairs area.

23
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:46,000
But whatever.

24
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:49,000
We're good.

25
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:51,000
I'm already on expert.

26
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:54,000
So I hopefully you guys can't hear this.

27
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:57,000
Make sure my like web cam's not on not like pointing at me.

28
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:59,000
Okay we're good.

29
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:06,000
Let's stand up.

30
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:13,000
Is one of the problems I'm having with streaming a console game is it's it's on the screen right now right.

31
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:16,000
And it's audio is obviously coming through.

32
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:18,000
I don't want to pick up that audio.

33
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:19,000
I don't have like this.

34
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:21,000
I can't plug headphones into my TV.

35
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:23,000
I just want to make sure you don't make it down here.

36
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:27,000
It whatever.

37
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:30,000
Have a good 60th birthday.

38
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:35,000
60th birthday.

39
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:38,000
Not that old.

40
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:42,000
Actually I have a couple of levels from a star.

41
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:44,000
We'll get to those.

42
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:46,000
I haven't warmed up at all by the way.

43
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:49,000
And I'm still playing on the brick.

44
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:51,000
So don't get your hopes up.

45
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:56,000
I've seen me get past level 3.

46
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:59,000
And hopefully I've got the audio input delay.

47
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:00,000
I fixed it hopefully.

48
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:02,000
I don't know.

49
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:11,000
So it's very attractively called coin hole.

50
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:14,000
Easy enough.

51
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:16,000
Is he going to come down?

52
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:17,000
He is.

53
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:19,000
He comes right back up.

54
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:26,000
Off to a great start.

55
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:29,000
Oh geez.

56
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:34,000
So I guess I do have to wait.

57
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:36,000
How long does it?

58
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:37,000
No, I got to wait.

59
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:38,000
Second cycle.

60
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:41,000
Way from to come up again.

61
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:42,000
Oh geez.

62
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:44,000
Maybe not.

63
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:51,000
There's only one fly over here.

64
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:55,000
Apparently.

65
00:03:55,000 --> 00:04:03,000
Alright, let's figure this out.

66
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:10,000
I got to go now.

67
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:17,000
Yeah, okay, okay.

68
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:21,000
I got to go right on that first one.

69
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:22,000
I don't know.

70
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:23,000
Maybe I'm screwed here.

71
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:31,000
Did I just screw myself completely?

72
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:36,000
Apparently I did.

73
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:37,000
Here we do it.

74
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:38,000
Here we do.

75
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:39,000
This is the one.

76
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:44,000
And there we go.

77
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:47,000
What?

78
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:50,000
I might just skip this one.

79
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:51,000
I don't know.

80
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:52,000
What the hell is even going on here?

81
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:54,000
Do I have to get it to like come over to me?

82
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:56,000
Like we're going to aggro range?

83
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:59,000
I like that.

84
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:05,000
Okay.

85
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:09,000
That was very confusing.

86
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:10,000
Gotta get those coins.

87
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:16,000
It's the most boring thing.

88
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:17,000
Look for hidden blocks.

89
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:25,000
People put them everywhere.

90
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:27,000
Okay.

91
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:29,000
Looking good.

92
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:42,000
I can just run across that.

93
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:43,000
Am I going to die if I go down here?

94
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:45,000
Yeah, I am.

95
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:47,000
I'm not doing that.

96
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:52,000
I'm not going to fool me on that one.

97
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:59,000
What would have happened if I just died if I went down there?

98
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:07,000
Yeah, after I absolutely not get through this expert, I will do levels for you guys.

99
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:13,000
If you got some good ones.

100
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:17,000
Are you star?

101
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:20,000
I don't know.

102
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:24,000
All right.

103
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:29,000
You know, to save myself a little bit of time, I probably shouldn't just sprint directly through each level.

104
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:33,000
My first or second life, I should really just kind of look and see what happens.

105
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:39,000
So very obviously I have to jump on these to get across.

106
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:40,000
Okay.

107
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:44,000
Would it be you say game?

108
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:45,000
I guess I could do this though.

109
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:46,000
No, I don't.

110
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:47,000
I don't have it.

111
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:48,000
Maybe I do.

112
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:52,000
Nope, that doesn't work.

113
00:06:52,000 --> 00:07:05,000
I thought that you could bounce on those things.

114
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:08,000
Oh, that's not that bad.

115
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:10,000
I should get to the next one or two times.

116
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:11,000
I'll try this.

117
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:18,000
Just about bounce enough to the second one and then you're pretty much free.

118
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:22,000
Oh.

119
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:29,000
You can bounce on those things.

120
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:30,000
You can't not.

121
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:31,000
I just died doing it.

122
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:40,000
Don't troll me, star.

123
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:47,000
What's going on here?

124
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:51,000
Can't I bounce on those things?

125
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:57,000
There's no way I can beat this unless I can, right?

126
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:58,000
I didn't even try to.

127
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:00,000
I didn't even say I just freaked out right there.

128
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:07,000
That was stupid.

129
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:22,000
I hit this fucking ceiling.

130
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:28,000
Something else I have to invest in is a wired controller as well.

131
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:30,000
This thing in my hands, I sweat a lot.

132
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:31,000
I'm a little sweaty.

133
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:32,000
I'm a bitch.

134
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:38,000
I get greasy on this brick.

135
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:45,000
Shit.

136
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:49,000
Oh, yeah.

137
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:55,000
I get it.

138
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:56,000
You can spin jump on those.

139
00:08:56,000 --> 00:09:02,000
You don't have to do like the Tony Hawk's Pro Skater strategy.

140
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:10,000
Although I probably should still because I'll mess that up a thousand times.

141
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:16,000
I can do it to them too then.

142
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:23,000
I can't do it to that unfortunately.

143
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:30,000
Huh.

144
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:33,000
I wonder what I'm missing here unless there's something I'm just going to jump.

145
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:39,000
There's something I can do about it, right?

146
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:45,000
Was there a mushroom over there that I missed somehow?

147
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:51,000
Oh my god, you gotta be kidding me.

148
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:53,000
That's where that is.

149
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:55,000
I did that by accident.

150
00:09:55,000 --> 00:10:05,000
If I did not just by accidently do that, I would have never ever ever beaten this stage and I would have skipped it.

151
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:09,000
I would have had to skip it.

152
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:14,000
Like how the hell are you supposed to know that's there?

153
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:24,000
Oh my god, this is all no, no, no, no, expert level.

154
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:29,000
I have to like carry it at least to the next part.

155
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:30,000
That's not even an expert.

156
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:31,000
I don't even know where it is.

157
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:32,000
I don't even know how to throw it.

158
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:34,000
Okay, right here.

159
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:36,000
I'm not gonna focus on this too.

160
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:42,000
I thought I had that one in the bag.

161
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:52,000
This is not a bitch shit in my fucking hair and use it as shampoo.

162
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:58,000
Where is it?

163
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:04,000
Just overshot it.

164
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:09,000
Get this fucking ceiling again.

165
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:13,000
I actually might step on this so I don't have to keep holding down why.

166
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:15,000
Because that's what's like throwing me off.

167
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:20,000
Is having to hold the other button.

168
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:21,000
No, that's such a bad idea.

169
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:23,000
I'm not gonna make it.

170
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:24,000
Because I can have to rush the hell out of this.

171
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:29,000
Just don't rush it.

172
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:34,000
I rushed it immediately.

173
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:39,000
I said not to.

174
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:41,000
How would you have ever known that was there?

175
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:46,000
Is there no clue that that's like a thing?

176
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:49,000
I rushed it again.

177
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:56,000
I might skip this one.

178
00:11:57,000 --> 00:12:05,000
Oh fuck.

179
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:07,000
Three more attempts and I'm skipping it.

180
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:17,000
I hate this one just because of what happened in the beginning here.

181
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:25,000
I'm already getting upset at this one.

182
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:29,000
How do I put this down on the ground?

183
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:32,000
I don't want to kick it.

184
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:35,000
I don't want to kick this.

185
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:38,000
It's gonna get kicked.

186
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:43,000
Yeah, I can.

187
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:50,000
Oh boy, here we go.

188
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:54,000
Mother fuck.

189
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:58,000
That was going fine.

190
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:05,000
I just screwed it up at the end.

191
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:09,000
Let me move back a little.

192
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:15,000
I don't even know what happened there.

193
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:22,000
That would be so bad if I kicked it off.

194
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:29,000
Easy now.

195
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:42,000
I wonder if I'll make this easier on myself if I use the Wii U stick sideways rather than the brick.

196
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:45,000
Is that better?

197
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:52,000
Fuck.

198
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:58,000
It's that last one.

199
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:02,000
That last jump always gets me because he ended up hitting the ceiling.

200
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:08,000
The hole just fucking thing for so long.

201
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:14,000
Dear lord in heaven.

202
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:17,000
The Wii Mode sucks too.

203
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:21,000
How much is one of the regular Nintendo controllers?

204
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:26,000
Are they like 60 bucks?

205
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:33,000
God.

206
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:43,000
I'm trying to see.

207
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:46,000
Not in doing it.

208
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:47,000
Never mind.

209
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:50,000
The classic controller is only 20 bucks.

210
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:51,000
I should get one.

211
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:57,000
It seems like a much better idea.

212
00:14:57,000 --> 00:15:06,000
That last one just gets me every single fucking time.

213
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:13,000
It's funny because I actually said to myself like maybe I should wait till I get like a real controller before I actually play this on stream again.

214
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:14,000
And what do you know?

215
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:23,000
I turn the fucking stream on without a pro controller.

216
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:26,000
We're getting locked into this one.

217
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:28,000
I might skip it.

218
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:35,000
I might do skip strats.

219
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:50,000
Oh dear god.

220
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:52,000
You know what? Hold on a second.

221
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:57,000
I think I have an idea.

222
00:15:57,000 --> 00:15:58,000
No I don't.

223
00:15:58,000 --> 00:15:59,000
I don't have an idea.

224
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:03,000
I see the weight.

225
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:11,000
Hey look I made it.

226
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:13,000
Shit.

227
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:14,000
Shit.

228
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:16,000
If I step on this.

229
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:19,000
Oh my god I just did it.

230
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:22,000
I didn't even understand what was happening.

231
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:28,000
I don't know why I just activated.

232
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:41,000
Oh boy.

233
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:46,000
Those patterns seem to be off half the time for me.

234
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:56,000
Alright we're gonna do this one more time and I'm skipping it because I'm not gonna have another stream where I sit on the same level for like 40 minutes.

235
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:58,000
After this one that was level 69.

236
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:07,000
I can't end on that one.

237
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:15,000
Come here at you.

238
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:21,000
Oh I was gonna hit silky.

239
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:26,000
Oh there's an actual shortcut on this level.

240
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:27,000
Where is it?

241
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:32,000
If I just hit this we'll just show to me now.

242
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:34,000
Why have I not been doing that?

243
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:35,000
Holy shit.

244
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:37,000
Why the hell have I been not doing that?

245
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:38,000
I'm just gonna do that.

246
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:40,000
That sounds, it looks like much easier.

247
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:44,000
Just jump the whole thing.

248
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:53,000
Oh what?

249
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:58,000
That's not fair.

250
00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:03,000
I'll try this with this strategy a couple more times.

251
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:13,000
No I hit it too high.

252
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:19,000
Come on.

253
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:20,000
No that was a bad idea.

254
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:28,000
Nevermind that's a terrible idea.

255
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:34,000
Alright this is really the last attempt before I skip.

256
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:35,000
Okay, try to always skip.

257
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:37,000
Get me out of this fucking level.

258
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:41,000
Bye.

259
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:48,000
We're gonna play a different one.

260
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:50,000
Look at this level.

261
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:57,000
This level is much better.

262
00:18:57,000 --> 00:19:06,000
Look at those in mushrooms.

263
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:13,000
Where's the inner here?

264
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:18,000
Oh shit.

265
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:23,000
Damn it.

266
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:27,000
The next one was the ticket.

267
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:28,000
No way.

268
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:30,000
I never would have beaten that one.

269
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:35,000
It was just too awkward.

270
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:46,000
Oh boy, I was like talking.

271
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:54,000
Those guys are going to be aware of it.

272
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:56,000
I'm gonna hit by those spikes.

273
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:58,000
We'll let you go by.

274
00:19:58,000 --> 00:20:00,000
I think he will.

275
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:01,000
What's his pattern?

276
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:04,000
Yeah, there he goes.

277
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:11,000
Oh I start off float.

278
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:14,000
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, easy, easy, easy.

279
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:16,000
Get in the fucking boat.

280
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:19,000
I screwed it up already.

281
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:20,000
Maybe not though.

282
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:27,000
Just to go through this with fast enough.

283
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:28,000
Keep them behind the wall.

284
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:33,000
They will not be able to hit you.

285
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:36,000
Boy, this is actually gonna be very difficult.

286
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:41,000
Is it possible for me to still do it without the cloud?

287
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:48,000
Shit.

288
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:59,000
Oh, that was a mistake.

289
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:04,000
I was not able to get by fast.

290
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:18,000
That was toast already.

291
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:19,000
Slow this one down.

292
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:22,000
I don't need to go that fast.

293
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:25,000
That guy will hit you every single time.

294
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:28,000
I'm gonna go for like that.

295
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:32,000
Some reason he still hit me.

296
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:35,000
Shit, I hit him.

297
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:46,000
All right, so how long till I rage quit this game and go play like fucking checkers?

298
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:52,000
When am I gonna start like live stream and be like eating snacks?

299
00:21:52,000 --> 00:22:01,000
Oh, my god, that's just like not paying any attention anymore.

300
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:03,000
Still doable.

301
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:06,000
I just rush things way too much.

302
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:08,000
Maybe a little while.

303
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:10,000
There are like secrets up here.

304
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:13,000
I guess not.

305
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:15,000
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

306
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:16,000
Secret.

307
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:17,000
That was a mushroom.

308
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:19,000
A mushroom just came out of that guy.

309
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:20,000
What did they come out?

310
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:21,000
No, they came out of the, okay, okay.

311
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:33,000
I'm gonna stop being such a fucking dumbass and like using these lives instantly.

312
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:35,000
Both of them.

313
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:38,000
Slow the fuck down.

314
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:47,000
How am I supposed to know how I was gonna avoid that?

315
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:50,000
Wait for this guy to come up.

316
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:53,000
Okay, geez.

317
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:56,000
Oh my god.

318
00:22:56,000 --> 00:23:01,000
I'm just gonna die.

319
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:06,000
I was gonna jump into the fucking lava.

320
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:10,000
Probably, I probably still would get angry playing checkers.

321
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:16,000
I don't know when the last time I played checkers was.

322
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:26,000
Whoa.

323
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:28,000
There was a mushroom in here though.

324
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:29,000
Where was that mushroom?

325
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:31,000
How did I get it?

326
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:34,000
It was like, I went up here.

327
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:36,000
Drops down and out.

328
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:42,000
Okay, I say, I say, I say.

329
00:23:43,000 --> 00:24:01,000
Too many things on the screen.

330
00:24:01,000 --> 00:24:04,000
I wonder.

331
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:05,000
Waiting is bad.

332
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:08,000
It's always bad for me to wait here.

333
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:15,000
another one's just gonna come from the other side right kind of I guess

334
00:24:15,000 --> 00:24:17,000
not really

335
00:24:25,000 --> 00:24:33,000
okay I have three hits now maybe even four

336
00:24:33,000 --> 00:24:41,000
power right through it oh shit they follow through the I didn't I just

337
00:24:41,000 --> 00:24:45,000
realize that they come through I thought I thought I could just power right

338
00:24:45,000 --> 00:24:50,000
through that but I forgot that they can like move through the thing and put

339
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:54,000
through everything that's gonna be a lot harder than I thought it was gonna be

340
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:59,000
initially so I can't just blow right through and just damage boosted I just

341
00:24:59,000 --> 00:25:04,000
need to wait it's gonna be fun

342
00:25:05,000 --> 00:25:14,000
is he gone now he's gone I ran right into his fucking little bridge I just

343
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:19,000
grabbed the wall hey remember what I said last time I played this grabbing the

344
00:25:19,000 --> 00:25:28,000
fucking walls in this game I wish that they deleted it I wish I could like

345
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:33,000
hold like L&R to like grab a wall I hate auto grabbing walls in games it

346
00:25:33,000 --> 00:25:36,000
tries me I've been crazy

347
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:53,000
all right what the fuck is happened what the fuck just happened why didn't he

348
00:25:53,000 --> 00:26:05,000
don't go in it okay I need to get them on the both the same side they're in such

349
00:26:05,000 --> 00:26:09,000
a terrible spot they need to be they need to both me on the same side although

350
00:26:09,000 --> 00:26:16,000
it's impossible for me to go through this come over here

351
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:34,000
there we go I'm trying to figure out what the opportunity is to go all right so

352
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:38,000
it's this over here

353
00:26:39,000 --> 00:26:43,000
really

354
00:26:47,000 --> 00:26:51,000
so what determines if they're gonna follow you and not like in sprint like that

355
00:26:51,000 --> 00:26:57,000
fast across the screen

356
00:26:58,000 --> 00:27:02,000
I just got to go down up up

357
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:13,000
so they bounce back bounce back bounce back

358
00:27:17,000 --> 00:27:20,000
shit

359
00:27:21,000 --> 00:27:30,000
it needs a shell hey guys it beat a level can you believe it

360
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:49,000
I don't think we like 55 lives to be the little

361
00:27:51,000 --> 00:27:57,000
jump so I think I have to do that right I have to immediately get rid of Yoshi yeah

362
00:27:57,000 --> 00:28:06,000
sorry Yoshi sorry that's me and

363
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:10,000
holy crap what the hell's going on here I just freaked out for some of this all

364
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:24,000
these spiky guys that was cool I gotta ditch you again Yoshi I'm sorry

365
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:34,000
okay go in there

366
00:28:39,000 --> 00:28:48,000
shit that was the follow up to that one that was the follow up to that one

367
00:28:49,000 --> 00:28:56,000
can I spawn them again I don't think it matters can I get back there I think I've lost it

368
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:08,000
the fuck these areas what the hell was that is that what I have to do

369
00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:17,000
I guess that's what I have to do

370
00:29:17,000 --> 00:29:40,000
I love the laugh I like this level so you've got to go one two three I can probably

371
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:46,000
skip it right if I go now wish two three four no not really

372
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:57,000
shit I do have to do I don't know what's the correct way to do that go off the

373
00:29:57,000 --> 00:30:10,000
first one I assume it's just go off the first one right I'm sure we'll figure that out in a second

374
00:30:17,000 --> 00:30:20,000
it must be has to be a leap of faith off that first one yeah

375
00:30:27,000 --> 00:30:32,000
as easy as he goes the highest spin jump maybe

376
00:30:38,000 --> 00:30:44,000
I'm gonna assume it's one two on these ones let's do it

377
00:30:47,000 --> 00:30:55,000
I'm not I don't think he even does that last one doesn't go high enough I don't think

378
00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:10,000
it's gotta be another one you you have to make like a staircase at this point right yep

379
00:31:11,000 --> 00:31:15,000
maybe that is what you had to do and that was just kind of there is a screw you

380
00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:26,000
oh you had to go faster this one nice okay there we go that's all

381
00:31:33,000 --> 00:31:36,000
skip let me just skip that one

382
00:31:37,000 --> 00:31:42,000
some of these man some of these with like the hidden blocks that you have to just find

383
00:31:45,000 --> 00:31:51,000
does make me very angry and I get pissed off and I start to grab and squeeze on my controller and

384
00:31:53,000 --> 00:31:58,000
use it as a frying pan because look at this thing it's as big as a fucking frying pan

385
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:05,000
I don't know if I believe this this probably some type of hidden thing whatever you get it

386
00:32:07,000 --> 00:32:09,000
oh shit try again to goon there's

387
00:32:17,000 --> 00:32:17,000
aha

388
00:32:20,000 --> 00:32:23,000
now you can't go through it back okay could they can they go walk through those yes they can of

389
00:32:23,000 --> 00:32:26,000
course why why wouldn't they be able to do that

390
00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:36,000
well shoot the big shell I'm thought they'd be up I knew it I knew it I knew it I

391
00:32:36,000 --> 00:32:51,000
knew it I need that I need this I need to carry one of the smaller ones through

392
00:32:52,000 --> 00:32:56,000
why is there a coin there is the point of the coin being there

393
00:32:57,000 --> 00:33:07,000
I don't want any of these little shits ruining

394
00:33:09,000 --> 00:33:10,000
ruining this

395
00:33:16,000 --> 00:33:17,000
I know to grab them

396
00:33:18,000 --> 00:33:27,000
you can't pick them up can you so how do you get over that I don't know

397
00:33:33,000 --> 00:33:34,000
the guy understand

398
00:33:37,000 --> 00:33:37,000
yep

399
00:33:40,000 --> 00:33:46,000
what is below this please don't just y'all oh shit a look at you do

400
00:33:48,000 --> 00:33:55,000
oh

401
00:34:09,000 --> 00:34:16,000
yeah

402
00:34:16,000 --> 00:34:25,000
I wasn't going fast enough.

403
00:34:25,000 --> 00:34:26,000
This one's doable.

404
00:34:26,000 --> 00:34:31,000
Very, very much so.

405
00:34:31,000 --> 00:34:42,000
No, not way to the firsts or second shot.

406
00:34:43,000 --> 00:34:44,000
Nope, wasn't going.

407
00:34:44,000 --> 00:34:46,000
You got to be running with it.

408
00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:48,000
That's something I was doing that first time.

409
00:34:48,000 --> 00:34:49,000
You just got to go right over him.

410
00:34:59,000 --> 00:35:02,000
Oh, fucking eat my ass.

411
00:35:13,000 --> 00:35:15,000
Thank you.

412
00:35:15,000 --> 00:35:18,000
I get rid of these turtles.

413
00:35:21,000 --> 00:35:24,000
OK, let him come back.

414
00:35:24,000 --> 00:35:28,000
No, that's not it.

415
00:35:28,000 --> 00:35:30,000
Seems this is actually pretty difficult.

416
00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:32,000
He needs to be on the way back.

417
00:35:32,000 --> 00:35:33,000
That's for sure.

418
00:35:37,000 --> 00:35:38,000
That was it.

419
00:35:38,000 --> 00:35:40,000
I don't know what I did wrong there.

420
00:35:42,000 --> 00:35:52,000
Please do our kids are watching.

421
00:35:52,000 --> 00:35:54,000
At this late at night, I'm not sure about that.

422
00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:05,000
You know, be really easy if I could just get it on the first run.

423
00:36:05,000 --> 00:36:09,000
I have to get it on the first run otherwise I'll never get it.

424
00:36:09,000 --> 00:36:14,000
Could do the mid air spin too, but twirl around.

425
00:36:14,000 --> 00:36:18,000
I always forget you can do that in this game.

426
00:36:18,000 --> 00:36:19,000
That thing.

427
00:36:22,000 --> 00:36:23,000
They're awkward spot from my finger, though.

428
00:36:28,000 --> 00:36:29,000
It's like up on the top.

429
00:36:33,000 --> 00:36:37,000
Because the Wii U gamepad, it's like that's so far

430
00:36:37,000 --> 00:36:40,000
above where my thumbs are.

431
00:36:40,000 --> 00:36:44,000
So hitting the right trigger is like extremely awkward playing this game.

432
00:36:49,000 --> 00:36:52,000
I can't wait until I don't have to ever use this thing again, though.

433
00:36:52,000 --> 00:36:54,000
Holy shit, this thing sucks.

434
00:37:01,000 --> 00:37:02,000
There it is.

435
00:37:08,000 --> 00:37:12,000
Oh, he just keeps throwing him.

436
00:37:12,000 --> 00:37:13,000
What the fuck?

437
00:37:13,000 --> 00:37:15,000
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, wait a second.

438
00:37:15,000 --> 00:37:16,000
Wait a second.

439
00:37:16,000 --> 00:37:17,000
Where did I go?

440
00:37:17,000 --> 00:37:18,000
I gotta kill him.

441
00:37:18,000 --> 00:37:19,000
I gotta jump on his head.

442
00:37:19,000 --> 00:37:21,000
I thought there was gonna be a little ledge I could go over on the right.

443
00:37:24,000 --> 00:37:27,000
Okay, I gotta jump over him, hit him and take his spot.

444
00:37:28,000 --> 00:37:30,000
That's gonna be kind of a pain in the ass.

445
00:37:31,000 --> 00:37:32,000
Shit, this too close.

446
00:37:43,000 --> 00:37:44,000
There we go.

447
00:37:49,000 --> 00:37:50,000
Let's move.

448
00:37:51,000 --> 00:37:52,000
I want instantly died by something.

449
00:37:52,000 --> 00:37:53,000
Nothing over here, right?

450
00:37:53,000 --> 00:37:54,000
No.

451
00:38:01,000 --> 00:38:02,000
Oh, he can just jump out.

452
00:38:03,000 --> 00:38:04,000
What the fuck?

453
00:38:06,000 --> 00:38:07,000
Come on.

454
00:38:07,000 --> 00:38:09,000
I didn't even have a time to react.

455
00:38:09,000 --> 00:38:10,000
There's no reaction time.

456
00:38:12,000 --> 00:38:14,000
They just threw me in a room with a ball.

457
00:38:18,000 --> 00:38:19,000
Oh, whoops, run, but.

458
00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:26,000
They're just bouncing around and shit.

459
00:38:26,000 --> 00:38:27,000
Come on.

460
00:38:31,000 --> 00:38:33,000
That was so stupid.

461
00:38:33,000 --> 00:38:34,000
That was not fair.

462
00:38:38,000 --> 00:38:43,000
I love how expert levels, you take the word expert and actually you can just put in a different word.

463
00:38:43,000 --> 00:38:46,000
It's called random unfair shit.

464
00:38:48,000 --> 00:38:49,000
Are you out?

465
00:38:49,000 --> 00:38:50,000
Let's put like, no, no, no, no.

466
00:38:50,000 --> 00:38:54,000
We're gonna make sure like when you go in this room, you fucking guaranteed to die at least once.

467
00:38:54,000 --> 00:38:57,000
Now I'm mad and I'm just walking to stuff.

468
00:39:01,000 --> 00:39:04,000
The stream lagged for me so it looks like you just walked in and died.

469
00:39:04,000 --> 00:39:06,000
Oh, that is exactly what happened.

470
00:39:06,000 --> 00:39:07,000
I walked in and died.

471
00:39:09,000 --> 00:39:10,000
Alright, I'm gonna...

472
00:39:10,000 --> 00:39:18,000
Let's, let's, let's, let's, let's get some of the passion back into this because I'm now just walking into stuff and dying.

473
00:39:31,000 --> 00:39:32,000
That's gonna come back at me.

474
00:39:32,000 --> 00:39:33,000
I'm gonna be careful here.

475
00:39:36,000 --> 00:39:37,000
Hello?

476
00:39:39,000 --> 00:39:40,000
What?

477
00:39:40,000 --> 00:39:41,000
What?

478
00:39:43,000 --> 00:39:44,000
Are you kidding me?

479
00:39:46,000 --> 00:39:48,000
Please just walk through this. Thank you.

480
00:39:51,000 --> 00:39:52,000
Hurry up, you're so damn slow.

481
00:39:53,000 --> 00:39:54,000
Yeah, that was, that was doomed.

482
00:40:09,000 --> 00:40:10,000
That was doomed from start.

483
00:40:12,000 --> 00:40:14,000
That was, that was, they didn't want me to win that one.

484
00:40:22,000 --> 00:40:24,000
That's such dog shit.

485
00:40:24,000 --> 00:40:26,000
I did it, that was perfect.

486
00:40:26,000 --> 00:40:28,000
You can't do it on that first time.

487
00:40:28,000 --> 00:40:30,000
You have to wait till it goes by.

488
00:40:30,000 --> 00:40:33,000
You have to wait until it goes by one time.

489
00:40:35,000 --> 00:40:37,000
Otherwise, that's just gonna happen to you every single...

490
00:40:37,000 --> 00:40:39,000
Fucking time.

491
00:40:39,000 --> 00:40:40,000
Every single time.

492
00:40:40,000 --> 00:40:42,000
That's gonna happen to you every time.

493
00:40:43,000 --> 00:40:45,000
Jump the first one and do it on the second one.

494
00:40:49,000 --> 00:40:50,000
I did, I didn't do it.

495
00:40:50,000 --> 00:40:51,000
I didn't do it. Mom, I didn't do it.

496
00:40:51,000 --> 00:40:52,000
Mom?

497
00:40:52,000 --> 00:40:53,000
Didn't do it.

498
00:40:53,000 --> 00:40:54,000
No, I didn't do it again, mom.

499
00:40:54,000 --> 00:40:55,000
Come back.

500
00:40:55,000 --> 00:40:57,000
Dude, we'll try to get him, mom.

501
00:40:59,000 --> 00:41:00,000
There we go.

502
00:41:00,000 --> 00:41:01,000
I did it, mom.

503
00:41:07,000 --> 00:41:08,000
Okay.

504
00:41:08,000 --> 00:41:09,000
Just what do I do here?

505
00:41:09,000 --> 00:41:10,000
I don't know.

506
00:41:14,000 --> 00:41:15,000
I've no idea, I did.

507
00:41:15,000 --> 00:41:16,000
That j... I...

508
00:41:16,000 --> 00:41:17,000
Fucki, didn't even do it.

509
00:41:17,000 --> 00:41:18,000
I have no idea what just happened.

510
00:41:20,000 --> 00:41:32,000
Holy shit holy shit

511
00:41:32,000 --> 00:41:40,000
Holy shit

512
00:41:40,000 --> 00:41:44,000
Is this a so completeable one?

513
00:41:44,000 --> 00:41:46,000
I'm gonna lose it.

514
00:41:46,000 --> 00:41:50,000
I don't think I got it.

515
00:41:50,000 --> 00:41:52,000
There it is.

516
00:41:52,000 --> 00:41:56,000
This is so completeable.

517
00:41:56,000 --> 00:41:57,000
Mom.

518
00:41:57,000 --> 00:42:02,000
I love the guy in chat that just said, what is he trying to talk to his mom?

519
00:42:02,000 --> 00:42:04,000
A fucking fireball.

520
00:42:04,000 --> 00:42:08,000
It's so stupid.

521
00:42:08,000 --> 00:42:11,000
I think I might skip this one too.

522
00:42:11,000 --> 00:42:13,000
We'll see.

523
00:42:13,000 --> 00:42:17,000
If I get there again, I don't know what to do there.

524
00:42:18,000 --> 00:42:24,000
There's a big skeleton blocking the road.

525
00:42:37,000 --> 00:42:42,000
Okay, this one I had to jump.

526
00:42:42,000 --> 00:42:43,000
Yeah, you just got to jump immediately.

527
00:42:43,000 --> 00:42:45,000
Here we go again.

528
00:42:45,000 --> 00:42:52,000
Do I just slide down the left and just not even care?

529
00:42:52,000 --> 00:42:59,000
What?

530
00:42:59,000 --> 00:43:01,000
What do I do?

531
00:43:01,000 --> 00:43:07,000
Does anybody have any strategy for this?

532
00:43:07,000 --> 00:43:14,000
I obviously have to hit that guy on the head from above on the ceiling.

533
00:43:14,000 --> 00:43:18,000
So if I hit the guy, then I have the ghost that's just sitting there the whole time.

534
00:43:18,000 --> 00:43:22,000
I have to pull that ghost away.

535
00:43:22,000 --> 00:43:25,000
That's gonna be very difficult.

536
00:43:25,000 --> 00:43:30,000
I don't think my brain is capable of completing that.

537
00:43:30,000 --> 00:43:36,000
We'll find out very shortly.

538
00:43:36,000 --> 00:43:43,000
I'll do some of that.

539
00:43:43,000 --> 00:43:50,000
You didn't even fucking do it that time.

540
00:43:50,000 --> 00:44:03,000
You only get hit dry bones once.

541
00:44:03,000 --> 00:44:04,000
It might be doable.

542
00:44:04,000 --> 00:44:11,000
But if that's the last area, that's the last screen, then I might be able to do it.

543
00:44:11,000 --> 00:44:14,000
Probably not.

544
00:44:14,000 --> 00:44:19,000
Don't get your hopes up.

545
00:44:19,000 --> 00:44:28,000
This one, I have no idea.

546
00:44:28,000 --> 00:44:31,000
Seriously.

547
00:44:32,000 --> 00:44:35,000
I've done that room five times now.

548
00:44:35,000 --> 00:44:39,000
I've done the exact same thing all five times.

549
00:44:39,000 --> 00:44:43,000
Half the time I land on his head.

550
00:44:43,000 --> 00:44:47,000
I guess I'm just gonna roll the dice in that room.

551
00:44:47,000 --> 00:44:54,000
I guess.

552
00:44:54,000 --> 00:45:01,000
What the fuck was with that little dinky fireball sitting there still?

553
00:45:13,000 --> 00:45:22,000
You little dinky fireballs.

554
00:45:22,000 --> 00:45:28,000
That's close.

555
00:45:28,000 --> 00:45:30,000
You didn't come in that time.

556
00:45:30,000 --> 00:45:31,000
You didn't even come in.

557
00:45:31,000 --> 00:45:32,000
I'm skipping it.

558
00:45:32,000 --> 00:45:33,000
We're out of here.

559
00:45:33,000 --> 00:45:34,000
Hit the skip.

560
00:45:34,000 --> 00:45:36,000
Where's the skip button?

561
00:45:36,000 --> 00:45:37,000
Give it to me.

562
00:45:37,000 --> 00:45:40,000
Get me out of there.

563
00:45:40,000 --> 00:45:46,000
See ya.

564
00:45:46,000 --> 00:45:51,000
I ain't doing that shit anymore.

565
00:45:51,000 --> 00:45:52,000
I like this one.

566
00:45:52,000 --> 00:45:59,000
There's a shoe in this one.

567
00:45:59,000 --> 00:46:05,000
Oh, it's gonna be Link.

568
00:46:05,000 --> 00:46:09,000
I'm trying to figure out like, is Link having any moves?

569
00:46:09,000 --> 00:46:17,000
Or is he trying to figure out what he does?

570
00:46:17,000 --> 00:46:19,000
Fuck is happening right now.

571
00:46:19,000 --> 00:46:21,000
I don't have any idea what I did.

572
00:46:21,000 --> 00:46:23,000
I must have just done something correct.

573
00:46:23,000 --> 00:46:24,000
No, I didn't.

574
00:46:24,000 --> 00:46:26,000
I don't know.

575
00:46:26,000 --> 00:46:30,000
I should have gone there.

576
00:46:30,000 --> 00:46:31,000
I guess.

577
00:46:31,000 --> 00:46:36,000
I guess we're still okay.

578
00:46:36,000 --> 00:46:40,000
Holy shit.

579
00:46:40,000 --> 00:46:50,000
I don't even know.

580
00:46:50,000 --> 00:46:57,000
Fuck is this game, man.

581
00:46:57,000 --> 00:46:59,000
I can't play the game right now.

582
00:46:59,000 --> 00:47:00,000
I'm sorry.

583
00:47:00,000 --> 00:47:06,000
I was gonna run.

584
00:47:06,000 --> 00:47:13,000
I'm supposed to beat this.

585
00:47:13,000 --> 00:47:18,000
And there's a change-up coming up.

586
00:47:18,000 --> 00:47:25,000
I'm fucking gone.

587
00:47:25,000 --> 00:47:27,000
I need to just stand still.

588
00:47:27,000 --> 00:47:29,000
I'm not gonna get a stand still.

589
00:47:29,000 --> 00:47:30,000
Are you serious?

590
00:47:30,000 --> 00:47:33,000
I'm gonna insta-die.

591
00:47:33,000 --> 00:47:40,000
Is there a reason why it's giving me Link?

592
00:47:40,000 --> 00:47:43,000
You guys all got shoes, huh?

593
00:47:43,000 --> 00:47:49,000
See if I can.

594
00:47:49,000 --> 00:47:52,000
Well, I guess I could kill that thing now that I know that.

595
00:47:52,000 --> 00:47:54,000
So I just can't move.

596
00:47:54,000 --> 00:47:55,000
Alright, I'm not gonna move.

597
00:47:55,000 --> 00:47:58,000
I'm gonna stand in the last one and I'm not going to move.

598
00:47:58,000 --> 00:48:02,000
I hope that's correct.

599
00:48:02,000 --> 00:48:09,000
Okay, I thought there was a thing there.

600
00:48:09,000 --> 00:48:14,000
It's working.

601
00:48:14,000 --> 00:48:17,000
It's working.

602
00:48:17,000 --> 00:48:19,000
There's so many things chasing me right now.

603
00:48:19,000 --> 00:48:26,000
I hope this is the correct strategy.

604
00:48:26,000 --> 00:48:28,000
I thought I was unaware.

605
00:48:28,000 --> 00:48:35,000
Maybe I was supposed to kill one of them and take one of their ships.

606
00:48:35,000 --> 00:48:38,000
I don't know.

607
00:48:38,000 --> 00:48:48,000
I did not know what to do there.

608
00:48:48,000 --> 00:48:52,000
Do I want the fireflower?

609
00:48:52,000 --> 00:48:59,000
I don't know.

610
00:48:59,000 --> 00:49:06,000
I don't want to boot anymore.

611
00:49:06,000 --> 00:49:09,000
It's making me move too weirdly.

612
00:49:09,000 --> 00:49:10,000
I think I'm just gonna jump out of it.

613
00:49:10,000 --> 00:49:12,000
Wait a minute.

614
00:49:12,000 --> 00:49:14,000
That thing's supposed to hit the-

615
00:49:14,000 --> 00:49:16,000
It was killing the other ones, wasn't it?

616
00:49:16,000 --> 00:49:21,000
They're at the same family.

617
00:49:22,000 --> 00:49:28,000
There is a pipe here.

618
00:49:28,000 --> 00:49:35,000
So yeah.

619
00:49:35,000 --> 00:49:44,000
I don't know if I'm going to get the right word up.

620
00:49:44,000 --> 00:49:46,000
Good luck.

621
00:49:46,000 --> 00:49:48,000
Thanks.

622
00:49:49,000 --> 00:49:51,000
I appreciate it.

623
00:49:51,000 --> 00:49:55,000
How do I get over there?

624
00:49:55,000 --> 00:49:59,000
The pipe down here?

625
00:49:59,000 --> 00:50:01,000
What is all this shit?

626
00:50:01,000 --> 00:50:06,000
Should I just fly up and go down the pipe?

627
00:50:06,000 --> 00:50:14,000
Get out of my way.

628
00:50:15,000 --> 00:50:16,000
Follow me down.

629
00:50:16,000 --> 00:50:20,000
Can I take this in the pipe?

630
00:50:20,000 --> 00:50:23,000
Holy shit.

631
00:50:23,000 --> 00:50:25,000
That was insane.

632
00:50:25,000 --> 00:50:31,000
I almost died.

633
00:50:31,000 --> 00:50:32,000
I don't know.

634
00:50:32,000 --> 00:50:38,000
He'll let's go.

635
00:50:38,000 --> 00:50:41,000
One more time.

636
00:50:41,000 --> 00:50:48,000
See you later.

637
00:50:48,000 --> 00:50:55,000
Did I win?

638
00:50:55,000 --> 00:51:02,000
Another pipe.

639
00:51:02,000 --> 00:51:03,000
I'm protected.

640
00:51:03,000 --> 00:51:05,000
I have a lot of protection right now.

641
00:51:05,000 --> 00:51:10,000
I'm not that scared.

642
00:51:10,000 --> 00:51:17,000
I'm not that scared.

643
00:51:17,000 --> 00:51:20,000
It's not very long.

644
00:51:20,000 --> 00:51:24,000
Holy shit in my pants.

645
00:51:24,000 --> 00:51:33,000
Should I go in there and go down?

646
00:51:33,000 --> 00:51:39,000
I wonder if I should go down there.

647
00:51:39,000 --> 00:51:40,000
Nope.

648
00:51:40,000 --> 00:51:41,000
It doesn't do anything.

649
00:51:41,000 --> 00:51:45,000
Oh, just shooting coins.

650
00:51:45,000 --> 00:51:46,000
Okay, that's funny.

651
00:51:46,000 --> 00:51:47,000
That's funny.

652
00:51:47,000 --> 00:51:56,000
I like this level now because that guy put that there and it shoots out coins.

653
00:51:56,000 --> 00:51:59,000
Holy goodness.

654
00:51:59,000 --> 00:52:06,000
A lot of trolls in this level.

655
00:52:07,000 --> 00:52:13,000
Looks like a knock this guy down there, right?

656
00:52:13,000 --> 00:52:14,000
Will he get him?

657
00:52:14,000 --> 00:52:16,000
Yes, he will.

658
00:52:16,000 --> 00:52:21,000
Not all of them.

659
00:52:21,000 --> 00:52:23,000
Well, that's what I get for standing still.

660
00:52:23,000 --> 00:52:28,000
I didn't realize there was fire underneath me.

661
00:52:28,000 --> 00:52:29,000
Okay.

662
00:52:29,000 --> 00:52:30,000
What the hell?

663
00:52:30,000 --> 00:52:31,000
Where am I going?

664
00:52:31,000 --> 00:52:35,000
What the hell's going on?

665
00:52:35,000 --> 00:52:40,000
I'm dead.

666
00:52:40,000 --> 00:52:41,000
That was weird.

667
00:52:41,000 --> 00:52:51,000
You just put a bunch of random shit all over the pole.

668
00:52:51,000 --> 00:52:54,000
Airship hard.

669
00:52:54,000 --> 00:52:57,000
Okay, last time I did expert.

670
00:52:57,000 --> 00:53:00,000
I got to, well, I got to level five and it was over.

671
00:53:00,000 --> 00:53:04,000
I couldn't beat it.

672
00:53:04,000 --> 00:53:09,000
This is a scroller.

673
00:53:09,000 --> 00:53:18,000
No, really, I guess kind of goes up.

674
00:53:18,000 --> 00:53:25,000
I should have nothing amissing, I guess, up here or whatever.

675
00:53:25,000 --> 00:53:32,000
I like the design of this one.

676
00:53:32,000 --> 00:53:35,000
That's pretty cool.

677
00:53:35,000 --> 00:53:40,000
I should have done that way sooner.

678
00:53:40,000 --> 00:53:45,000
You know, you just got to be careful.

679
00:53:45,000 --> 00:53:52,000
Oh, shit.

680
00:53:52,000 --> 00:53:59,000
A wizard.

681
00:53:59,000 --> 00:54:09,000
Why would this be here if there wasn't a reason for it?

682
00:54:09,000 --> 00:54:12,000
Yeah, okay.

683
00:54:12,000 --> 00:54:17,000
Shit.

684
00:54:17,000 --> 00:54:21,000
What the fuck?

685
00:54:21,000 --> 00:54:22,000
Geez.

686
00:54:22,000 --> 00:54:26,000
I thought it was going to keep going.

687
00:54:26,000 --> 00:54:29,000
That's a pretty big skip.

688
00:54:29,000 --> 00:54:37,000
Remember that for next time if I don't beat it.

689
00:54:37,000 --> 00:54:39,000
Tap fast, you can.

690
00:54:39,000 --> 00:54:45,000
Come on.

691
00:54:45,000 --> 00:54:51,000
Get over here.

692
00:54:51,000 --> 00:55:00,000
Oh.

693
00:55:00,000 --> 00:55:04,000
I kind of screwed over here, but yeah, I shouldn't be standing over there.

694
00:55:04,000 --> 00:55:11,000
That's a mistake.

695
00:55:11,000 --> 00:55:14,000
Is that it?

696
00:55:14,000 --> 00:55:17,000
Yes.

697
00:55:17,000 --> 00:55:20,000
The hitbox on that was a second away from hitting me.

698
00:55:20,000 --> 00:55:23,000
I don't know what I just don't know.

699
00:55:23,000 --> 00:55:26,000
That's the worst part about these levels is you just don't know.

700
00:55:26,000 --> 00:55:27,000
I just don't know.

701
00:55:27,000 --> 00:55:28,000
Thank God.

702
00:55:28,000 --> 00:55:33,000
Thank God that wasn't something stupid at the end.

703
00:55:33,000 --> 00:55:37,000
Those moles of the worst enemy in any Mario game.

704
00:55:37,000 --> 00:55:41,000
Yeah, they throw those wrenches that just go very, very slow.

705
00:55:41,000 --> 00:55:47,000
They're very, very annoying.

706
00:55:47,000 --> 00:55:49,000
That was a good one.

707
00:55:49,000 --> 00:55:56,000
That was that was that was fun, although I kind of just skipped everything.

708
00:55:56,000 --> 00:56:00,000
Okay, well, that's I'm that's what I get for reading over here.

709
00:56:00,000 --> 00:56:08,000
I'm looking over the chat and a saw blade just spins me right in the spine.

710
00:56:08,000 --> 00:56:09,000
Come on now.

711
00:56:09,000 --> 00:56:10,000
Get away from me.

712
00:56:10,000 --> 00:56:15,000
You serious.

713
00:56:15,000 --> 00:56:16,000
I like this one.

714
00:56:16,000 --> 00:56:18,000
This one's awesome.

715
00:56:18,000 --> 00:56:30,000
This one is really, really great because it's just like good luck.

716
00:56:30,000 --> 00:56:32,000
Okay, I'm definitely going to vote this one up.

717
00:56:32,000 --> 00:56:34,000
This one was amazing.

718
00:56:34,000 --> 00:56:40,000
Like what a dick.

719
00:56:40,000 --> 00:56:42,000
This is great.

720
00:56:42,000 --> 00:56:44,000
This is the best level.

721
00:56:44,000 --> 00:56:46,000
I don't even care if I die 50 times on this level.

722
00:56:46,000 --> 00:56:47,000
It's worth it.

723
00:56:47,000 --> 00:56:56,000
This one's awesome.

724
00:56:56,000 --> 00:56:58,000
Please.

725
00:56:58,000 --> 00:57:07,000
I should just run underneath them.

726
00:57:07,000 --> 00:57:09,000
I probably just keep running.

727
00:57:09,000 --> 00:57:12,000
No, not on that one.

728
00:57:12,000 --> 00:57:22,000
I'm going to do this first one though.

729
00:57:22,000 --> 00:57:24,000
I don't.

730
00:57:24,000 --> 00:57:25,000
What are these things?

731
00:57:25,000 --> 00:57:27,000
I can like, oh, what?

732
00:57:27,000 --> 00:57:29,000
I have to climb them.

733
00:57:29,000 --> 00:57:31,000
You, that's not actually that bad.

734
00:57:31,000 --> 00:57:35,000
I thought it was going to climb the whole thing.

735
00:57:35,000 --> 00:57:38,000
What?

736
00:57:39,000 --> 00:57:48,000
Do I reach out?

737
00:57:48,000 --> 00:57:50,000
Yeah, I do.

738
00:57:50,000 --> 00:57:51,000
Just German reach out.

739
00:57:51,000 --> 00:57:52,000
I'm on how responsive he is.

740
00:57:52,000 --> 00:57:58,000
Responsive enough to take two deaths because I'm over here reading.

741
00:57:58,000 --> 00:57:59,000
The whole goal with this one.

742
00:57:59,000 --> 00:58:00,000
You serious?

743
00:58:00,000 --> 00:58:01,000
No, it's already done.

744
00:58:01,000 --> 00:58:02,000
Just get me.

745
00:58:02,000 --> 00:58:06,000
You have to get so far ahead on this first, this first run rider.

746
00:58:06,000 --> 00:58:08,000
I got to go so fast.

747
00:58:08,000 --> 00:58:09,000
I got to get by.

748
00:58:09,000 --> 00:58:10,000
I got to have a lot of time.

749
00:58:10,000 --> 00:58:17,000
A lot of leeway.

750
00:58:17,000 --> 00:58:25,000
Like here, I got to get a lot of good time on this one.

751
00:58:25,000 --> 00:58:29,000
That last jump too.

752
00:58:29,000 --> 00:58:35,000
This is going to be so hard.

753
00:58:36,000 --> 00:58:39,000
Creatively, he made it so you really just can't run.

754
00:58:39,000 --> 00:58:41,000
You have to jump from time to time.

755
00:58:41,000 --> 00:58:44,000
Even if you want to try to do like, I'm not going to do it.

756
00:58:44,000 --> 00:58:47,000
I'm going to sprint technique.

757
00:58:47,000 --> 00:58:52,000
I don't want to pick it up.

758
00:58:52,000 --> 00:59:04,000
Okay, I've got a lot of time here.

759
00:59:04,000 --> 00:59:10,000
Oh god.

760
00:59:10,000 --> 00:59:13,000
I did it.

761
00:59:13,000 --> 00:59:16,000
If I answer with high, you'll become a nun.

762
00:59:16,000 --> 00:59:27,000
Well, time for you to become a nun.

763
00:59:27,000 --> 00:59:36,000
I don't have very many lives left.

764
00:59:36,000 --> 00:59:38,000
This is a scroller.

765
00:59:38,000 --> 00:59:40,000
No time to touch anything.

766
00:59:40,000 --> 00:59:45,000
That was a power button.

767
00:59:45,000 --> 00:59:46,000
This is very, very messy.

768
00:59:46,000 --> 00:59:47,000
This is a mess.

769
00:59:47,000 --> 00:59:49,000
There's a lot of mess going on.

770
00:59:49,000 --> 00:59:50,000
What a mess.

771
00:59:50,000 --> 00:59:51,000
What a mess.

772
00:59:51,000 --> 00:59:55,000
I just go up top.

773
00:59:55,000 --> 01:00:01,000
What the fuck is Bob doing over here?

774
01:00:01,000 --> 01:00:03,000
What the hell is happening?

775
01:00:03,000 --> 01:00:10,000
What's happening?

776
01:00:10,000 --> 01:00:15,000
I might just skip this one.

777
01:00:15,000 --> 01:00:20,000
The only thing I can think of is just, nope, you can't wait it out.

778
01:00:25,000 --> 01:00:32,000
No.

779
01:00:32,000 --> 01:00:38,000
Did I not die?

780
01:00:38,000 --> 01:00:39,000
I was still alive.

781
01:00:39,000 --> 01:00:42,000
I was still alive for like five straight seconds when I fell.

782
01:00:42,000 --> 01:00:46,000
Where was I?

783
01:00:46,000 --> 01:00:53,000
I am extremely confused by that.

784
01:00:53,000 --> 01:00:56,000
I can jump up.

785
01:00:56,000 --> 01:01:00,000
I can go on top of that and jump on top.

786
01:01:00,000 --> 01:01:05,000
That's what I'm going to do.

787
01:01:05,000 --> 01:01:06,000
Ready?

788
01:01:06,000 --> 01:01:09,000
This is the strategy right here.

789
01:01:09,000 --> 01:01:10,000
Got it.

790
01:01:10,000 --> 01:01:16,000
Got it.

791
01:01:16,000 --> 01:01:23,000
I was trying to fly.

792
01:01:23,000 --> 01:01:28,000
I'm not going to die, am I?

793
01:01:28,000 --> 01:01:35,000
What the fuck?

794
01:01:35,000 --> 01:01:43,000
Oh, God, Lord, I had that one too.

795
01:01:44,000 --> 01:01:48,000
No, this is not going to happen.

796
01:01:48,000 --> 01:02:01,000
I can't jump on his head.

797
01:02:01,000 --> 01:02:02,000
Give me the pow.

798
01:02:02,000 --> 01:02:07,000
This is so much shit happening at the same time.

799
01:02:07,000 --> 01:02:11,000
Maybe it's better to go up the left.

800
01:02:11,000 --> 01:02:18,000
I love that this one's called Epic Battle.

801
01:02:18,000 --> 01:02:25,000
Give me the mushroom.

802
01:02:25,000 --> 01:02:26,000
Great.

803
01:02:26,000 --> 01:02:29,000
It's no, I fucked it up.

804
01:02:29,000 --> 01:02:34,000
There's no way I'm going to be this way.

805
01:02:42,000 --> 01:02:47,000
Shit, this is going fucking everywhere.

806
01:02:47,000 --> 01:02:54,000
What, this flames and shit too come on.

807
01:03:06,000 --> 01:03:09,000
Hi.

808
01:03:10,000 --> 01:03:18,000
This one would be easy if at the very beginning you didn't get hit by everything in the game.

809
01:03:18,000 --> 01:03:26,000
Look at all this shit that they throw up on you.

810
01:03:26,000 --> 01:03:33,000
I have to sit here.

811
01:03:33,000 --> 01:03:39,000
I'm trying to jump on you.

812
01:03:39,000 --> 01:03:42,000
I'm getting locked in the corner.

813
01:03:42,000 --> 01:03:48,000
Anybody remember where the bridge is?

814
01:03:48,000 --> 01:03:51,000
Not there.

815
01:03:51,000 --> 01:03:52,000
Not there.

816
01:03:52,000 --> 01:03:53,000
The bridge wasn't there.

817
01:03:53,000 --> 01:03:54,000
I couldn't even see it.

818
01:03:54,000 --> 01:04:01,000
I didn't know where it was.

819
01:04:01,000 --> 01:04:08,000
I'm so tired.

820
01:04:08,000 --> 01:04:15,000
How annoying is this?

821
01:04:15,000 --> 01:04:22,000
I love that I have to have just a fish come out at you too.

822
01:04:22,000 --> 01:04:29,000
Nope.

823
01:04:29,000 --> 01:04:36,000
Oh, I got stuck.

824
01:04:36,000 --> 01:04:43,000
I was trying to do a reentactic and I didn't work.

825
01:04:43,000 --> 01:04:50,000
This is so fucking stupid.

826
01:04:50,000 --> 01:04:56,000
I wish I could make that jump.

827
01:04:56,000 --> 01:05:11,000
I just did, but I'm not going to help.

828
01:05:11,000 --> 01:05:15,000
Get away from me, everybody, please.

829
01:05:15,000 --> 01:05:22,000
Alright, let's do it.

830
01:05:22,000 --> 01:05:24,000
I'm not going to...

831
01:05:24,000 --> 01:05:26,000
Please.

832
01:05:26,000 --> 01:05:40,000
Don't even tell me I was about to lose that.

833
01:05:40,000 --> 01:05:51,000
Epic battle.

834
01:05:51,000 --> 01:05:58,000
This one's called my best level.

835
01:05:58,000 --> 01:06:03,000
I got a wall of coupons to start.

836
01:06:03,000 --> 01:06:10,000
I'm liking the wall of coupons.

837
01:06:10,000 --> 01:06:17,000
I feel like I should get up there faster.

838
01:06:17,000 --> 01:06:24,000
I'm going to get up there.

839
01:06:24,000 --> 01:06:29,000
Wait for it.

840
01:06:29,000 --> 01:06:33,000
What the hell is even here?

841
01:06:33,000 --> 01:06:37,000
I don't know.

842
01:06:37,000 --> 01:06:42,000
What on earth is going on here?

843
01:06:42,000 --> 01:06:46,000
Is there a shell I can grab?

844
01:06:46,000 --> 01:06:53,000
I guess I just have to take the damage and keep moving.

845
01:06:53,000 --> 01:07:00,000
Apparently.

846
01:07:00,000 --> 01:07:07,000
I don't know why that hit me.

847
01:07:07,000 --> 01:07:10,000
I'm just flying things.

848
01:07:10,000 --> 01:07:17,000
I'm just going to get up there and get some musical notes.

849
01:07:17,000 --> 01:07:20,000
Stuff that falls.

850
01:07:20,000 --> 01:07:24,000
Okay, I went through that.

851
01:07:24,000 --> 01:07:27,000
Get that out of here.

852
01:07:27,000 --> 01:07:29,000
I'm going to pick it up.

853
01:07:29,000 --> 01:07:33,000
Start out of my way.

854
01:07:33,000 --> 01:07:39,000
We all have to assume that this is what has to happen.

855
01:07:39,000 --> 01:07:42,000
Why would I ever want to go in there?

856
01:07:42,000 --> 01:07:46,000
Why would you ever go in there?

857
01:07:46,000 --> 01:07:53,000
Yeah, I missed it or something.

858
01:07:53,000 --> 01:08:01,000
Apparently, I guess that was just went too far.

859
01:08:01,000 --> 01:08:08,000
This is just a bunch of random platforms with enemies surrounding them all.

860
01:08:08,000 --> 01:08:21,000
That shouldn't be too difficult to get back there.

861
01:08:21,000 --> 01:08:25,000
Apparently it is though.

862
01:08:25,000 --> 01:08:32,000
I don't even know if I want to play this one again.

863
01:08:32,000 --> 01:08:40,000
I'm way above the sky box right now.

864
01:08:40,000 --> 01:08:42,000
I couldn't hit them.

865
01:08:42,000 --> 01:08:47,000
What that come on?

866
01:08:47,000 --> 01:08:54,000
I guess I can pick this up.

867
01:08:54,000 --> 01:09:02,000
Really, really now.

868
01:09:02,000 --> 01:09:07,000
Okay.

869
01:09:07,000 --> 01:09:14,000
Apparently, it wasn't high enough.

870
01:09:14,000 --> 01:09:21,000
I guess I get another one of those.

871
01:09:21,000 --> 01:09:29,000
I was trying to place that, but I don't need to.

872
01:09:29,000 --> 01:09:35,000
Maybe I should just break this.

873
01:09:35,000 --> 01:09:41,000
But if I might be in a lot of trouble.

874
01:09:41,000 --> 01:09:50,000
Maybe I just shouldn't go as high as I did before.

875
01:09:50,000 --> 01:09:54,000
I mean, what if there is something in here?

876
01:09:54,000 --> 01:10:01,000
It might be.

877
01:10:01,000 --> 01:10:07,000
I really appreciate if you stopped moving.

878
01:10:07,000 --> 01:10:14,000
This fireball coming right at me.

879
01:10:14,000 --> 01:10:17,000
I saw chat told me that it was the equipment.

880
01:10:17,000 --> 01:10:21,000
I could have been a secret door.

881
01:10:21,000 --> 01:10:28,000
Did I just die for no reason?

882
01:10:28,000 --> 01:10:48,000
I actually just forgot that that was right here.

883
01:10:48,000 --> 01:10:55,000
I don't know if I can do that.

884
01:10:55,000 --> 01:11:01,000
But this doesn't even matter.

885
01:11:01,000 --> 01:11:05,000
I'll tell you right now.

886
01:11:05,000 --> 01:11:11,000
I don't like being able to clip right through those fucking doors.

887
01:11:11,000 --> 01:11:18,000
Okay.

888
01:11:18,000 --> 01:11:26,000
What the hell is that thing?

889
01:11:26,000 --> 01:11:33,000
Looks like I'm picking up.

890
01:11:33,000 --> 01:11:40,000
I'm not messing around with that.

891
01:11:40,000 --> 01:11:53,000
I can't do it.

892
01:11:53,000 --> 01:12:00,000
I'm not messing around with that.

893
01:12:00,000 --> 01:12:06,000
I'm not messing around with that.

894
01:12:06,000 --> 01:12:13,000
I'm not messing around with that.

895
01:12:13,000 --> 01:12:22,000
I don't know if I'll get there or not, but I'm definitely coming.

896
01:12:22,000 --> 01:12:27,000
Oh, no.

897
01:12:27,000 --> 01:12:32,000
Thank you.

898
01:12:32,000 --> 01:12:37,000
That's a very nice of you.

899
01:12:37,000 --> 01:12:40,000
Slipper-y-ass blocks.

900
01:12:40,000 --> 01:12:46,000
I need to just go then.

901
01:12:46,000 --> 01:12:51,000
This way might be harder than the other way.

902
01:12:51,000 --> 01:12:56,000
I don't know what the hell is.

903
01:12:56,000 --> 01:13:01,000
How do I get in there?

904
01:13:01,000 --> 01:13:06,000
Is that an accident?

905
01:13:06,000 --> 01:13:11,000
I feel like that person did not me to put that there.

906
01:13:11,000 --> 01:13:14,000
Maybe they did.

907
01:13:14,000 --> 01:13:19,000
Trying to figure it out.

908
01:13:19,000 --> 01:13:24,000
That does not look like an entrance.

909
01:13:24,000 --> 01:13:30,000
Or there's an invisible block.

910
01:13:30,000 --> 01:13:34,000
I do it.

911
01:13:34,000 --> 01:13:47,000
I'm paranoid.

912
01:13:47,000 --> 01:13:52,000
Every time it's just not in the right spot for me to jump.

913
01:13:52,000 --> 01:14:01,000
Can you please be in the right spot for me to jump over to it?

914
01:14:01,000 --> 01:14:05,000
I should probably go in here.

915
01:14:05,000 --> 01:14:07,000
I don't know.

916
01:14:07,000 --> 01:14:10,000
I went in the third one.

917
01:14:10,000 --> 01:14:13,000
Third one's death.

918
01:14:13,000 --> 01:14:18,000
Third one is you just die.

919
01:14:18,000 --> 01:14:21,000
That's good to know.

920
01:14:21,000 --> 01:14:26,000
Maybe this will just bring me...

921
01:14:26,000 --> 01:14:30,000
You got it?

922
01:14:30,000 --> 01:14:39,000
We get two more lives.

923
01:14:39,000 --> 01:14:43,000
Cool.

924
01:14:43,000 --> 01:14:45,000
That's what that does.

925
01:14:45,000 --> 01:14:49,000
I was hoping maybe there'd be something else to do.

926
01:14:49,000 --> 01:14:53,000
There's a safer or something.

927
01:14:53,000 --> 01:15:00,000
This is the first one.

928
01:15:00,000 --> 01:15:07,000
I'm going to go in.

929
01:15:07,000 --> 01:15:14,000
So...

930
01:15:14,000 --> 01:15:19,000
I guess you do want to go in the second one.

931
01:15:19,000 --> 01:15:23,000
You have to go through this whole thing.

932
01:15:23,000 --> 01:15:25,000
I only have one second to go here.

933
01:15:25,000 --> 01:15:29,000
We're going to go into one of those two jump-up.

934
01:15:29,000 --> 01:15:34,000
Am I going to hit by this if I walk?

935
01:15:34,000 --> 01:15:38,000
I'm scared to walk.

936
01:15:38,000 --> 01:15:39,000
Whatever.

937
01:15:39,000 --> 01:15:44,000
Moment of truth.

938
01:15:44,000 --> 01:15:47,000
Moment of truth.

939
01:15:47,000 --> 01:15:50,000
That one comes up there.

940
01:15:50,000 --> 01:15:52,000
I'm so fucking god.

941
01:15:52,000 --> 01:15:54,000
I just went too high.

942
01:15:54,000 --> 01:15:58,000
I pressed the button too hard.

943
01:15:58,000 --> 01:16:01,000
That happens.

944
01:16:01,000 --> 01:16:10,000
Sometimes you just press the button and you jump across the whole map.

945
01:16:10,000 --> 01:16:12,000
Number two.

946
01:16:12,000 --> 01:16:14,000
Just for the shits.

947
01:16:14,000 --> 01:16:19,000
Number two seems to be the one that you want to use.

948
01:16:19,000 --> 01:16:27,000
Boy.

949
01:16:27,000 --> 01:16:30,000
I think it's over though.

950
01:16:30,000 --> 01:16:33,000
I don't know if there's anything about this.

951
01:16:33,000 --> 01:16:36,000
No, I just had to go faster.

952
01:16:36,000 --> 01:16:38,000
Well, there it is.

953
01:16:38,000 --> 01:16:42,000
I don't know any more lives.

954
01:16:42,000 --> 01:16:46,000
Oh well.

955
01:16:46,000 --> 01:16:54,000
I got to level eight.

956
01:16:54,000 --> 01:17:04,000
Let's give one more go.

957
01:17:04,000 --> 01:17:11,000
One more attempt.

958
01:17:11,000 --> 01:17:17,000
Mario memorization should be how this game gets renamed.

959
01:17:17,000 --> 01:17:21,000
Because you have to memorize every level.

960
01:17:21,000 --> 01:17:28,000
They give you 100 lives so you can spend 20 of them memorizing the level.

961
01:17:28,000 --> 01:17:34,000
You have to be small to get through here.

962
01:17:34,000 --> 01:17:37,000
That was Mario memorization.

963
01:17:37,000 --> 01:17:46,000
Guaranteed to die.

964
01:17:46,000 --> 01:17:53,000
I'm assuming you shouldn't touch any of these.

965
01:17:53,000 --> 01:18:03,000
What?

966
01:18:03,000 --> 01:18:04,000
Run, right?

967
01:18:04,000 --> 01:18:06,000
Do I have enough speed?

968
01:18:06,000 --> 01:18:15,000
Yeah, I do.

969
01:18:15,000 --> 01:18:18,000
I have to do more mushrooms.

970
01:18:18,000 --> 01:18:22,000
If you touch a mushroom, you just fail.

971
01:18:22,000 --> 01:18:23,000
Oh shit.

972
01:18:23,000 --> 01:18:27,000
Where did they come up?

973
01:18:27,000 --> 01:18:31,000
It's 1, 2, 3, 4.

974
01:18:31,000 --> 01:18:35,000
Okay, I've got time there.

975
01:18:35,000 --> 01:18:38,000
Or is that it?

976
01:18:38,000 --> 01:18:41,000
That might be it.

977
01:18:41,000 --> 01:18:45,000
I can't get one of these and jump in damage boost up.

978
01:18:45,000 --> 01:18:57,000
I can't see another reason why.

979
01:18:57,000 --> 01:19:01,000
No, no, it didn't want me to do that at all.

980
01:19:01,000 --> 01:19:04,000
I thought that's what it wanted me to do.

981
01:19:04,000 --> 01:19:09,000
Shit.

982
01:19:09,000 --> 01:19:16,000
One of these can see, one of these can fly up and touch me.

983
01:19:16,000 --> 01:19:17,000
Nope.

984
01:19:17,000 --> 01:19:19,000
Okay, well that, this one's cool.

985
01:19:19,000 --> 01:19:20,000
I like this one.

986
01:19:20,000 --> 01:19:26,000
This one's interesting.

987
01:19:26,000 --> 01:19:27,000
Shit.

988
01:19:27,000 --> 01:19:28,000
It's done.

989
01:19:28,000 --> 01:19:35,000
I forgot about that one.

990
01:19:36,000 --> 01:19:40,000
No, this course isn't too hard.

991
01:19:40,000 --> 01:19:43,000
I love how it, thanks for doing that, by the way, Nintendo.

992
01:19:43,000 --> 01:19:44,000
Thanks for doing that.

993
01:19:44,000 --> 01:19:49,000
Thanks for popping that screen up and making me have to hit A and then instantly lose the level.

994
01:19:49,000 --> 01:19:51,000
Appreciate it.

995
01:19:51,000 --> 01:19:54,000
Appreciate it.

996
01:19:54,000 --> 01:20:04,000
I really like that.

997
01:20:05,000 --> 01:20:16,000
I tried the jump, but I tried.

998
01:20:16,000 --> 01:20:23,000
It just didn't work.

999
01:20:23,000 --> 01:20:26,000
The dreaded sometimes you press jump and it just don't work some.

1000
01:20:26,000 --> 01:20:33,000
For some reason it just doesn't fucking work.

1001
01:20:34,000 --> 01:20:39,000
It's dreaded.

1002
01:20:39,000 --> 01:20:49,000
When I look down here, I'm curious as to why that isn't Arrow coming up here.

1003
01:20:49,000 --> 01:20:53,000
Maybe, no, I don't think that would work that way.

1004
01:20:53,000 --> 01:21:02,000
If I got a mushroom and I came back down, or should I just go all the way around?

1005
01:21:03,000 --> 01:21:05,000
This one's kind of cool.

1006
01:21:05,000 --> 01:21:07,000
This one's like a little puzzler.

1007
01:21:07,000 --> 01:21:09,000
What is it down here?

1008
01:21:09,000 --> 01:21:14,000
Just for curiosity's sake.

1009
01:21:14,000 --> 01:21:17,000
I don't know.

1010
01:21:17,000 --> 01:21:19,000
I guess I could go this way.

1011
01:21:19,000 --> 01:21:22,000
Maybe that will...

1012
01:21:22,000 --> 01:21:25,000
What the hell?

1013
01:21:25,000 --> 01:21:27,000
What is going on with my character right now?

1014
01:21:27,000 --> 01:21:31,000
Why am I like drunk?

1015
01:21:32,000 --> 01:21:34,000
I don't like this.

1016
01:21:34,000 --> 01:21:37,000
I don't like this at all.

1017
01:21:37,000 --> 01:21:46,000
Okay, it's in temporary.

1018
01:21:46,000 --> 01:21:48,000
Waiting.

1019
01:21:48,000 --> 01:21:49,000
Oh, okay.

1020
01:21:49,000 --> 01:21:50,000
There you go.

1021
01:21:50,000 --> 01:21:51,000
Sure.

1022
01:21:53,000 --> 01:21:56,000
Patterns.

1023
01:21:57,000 --> 01:22:01,000
I thought he was going up.

1024
01:22:11,000 --> 01:22:12,000
Fuck.

1025
01:22:12,000 --> 01:22:19,000
I thought he was seriously on his way up, but he was there for an extra like quarter of a second.

1026
01:22:20,000 --> 01:22:26,000
I'm going to try that again though.

1027
01:22:26,000 --> 01:22:37,000
I'm going to do it again.

1028
01:22:37,000 --> 01:22:42,000
Somebody's texting me.

1029
01:22:42,000 --> 01:22:45,000
Who's texting me?

1030
01:22:46,000 --> 01:22:47,000
Oh.

1031
01:22:47,000 --> 01:22:50,000
Star wants me to play his levels.

1032
01:22:50,000 --> 01:22:52,000
Star text me your levels because...

1033
01:22:52,000 --> 01:22:55,000
My computer is being a weirdo right now.

1034
01:22:55,000 --> 01:22:59,000
Text me your two levels.

1035
01:22:59,000 --> 01:23:01,000
I want to beat this one though.

1036
01:23:01,000 --> 01:23:04,000
This one's like interesting.

1037
01:23:10,000 --> 01:23:14,000
Get away from me.

1038
01:23:14,000 --> 01:23:16,000
Thank God this is just a visual.

1039
01:23:16,000 --> 01:23:21,000
Nothing else.

1040
01:23:21,000 --> 01:23:22,000
Whoa, shit.

1041
01:23:22,000 --> 01:23:24,000
That was close.

1042
01:23:32,000 --> 01:23:34,000
Oh, boy.

1043
01:23:34,000 --> 01:23:36,000
That last one really is just so.

1044
01:23:36,000 --> 01:23:38,000
So.

1045
01:23:38,000 --> 01:23:42,000
Buh.

1046
01:23:42,000 --> 01:23:43,000
Yeah, text me your levels.

1047
01:23:43,000 --> 01:23:44,000
I'll play them.

1048
01:23:44,000 --> 01:23:46,000
I might just do that so he can go to bed.

1049
01:23:46,000 --> 01:23:47,000
He wants to go to bed.

1050
01:23:47,000 --> 01:23:48,000
Poor Star.

1051
01:23:48,000 --> 01:23:52,000
Poor Star has been waiting for me to play his Mario Maker level.

1052
01:23:52,000 --> 01:23:57,000
And I just haven't done it.

1053
01:23:57,000 --> 01:24:03,000
He's there really.

1054
01:24:03,000 --> 01:24:06,000
That was happening.

1055
01:24:06,000 --> 01:24:09,000
I didn't get a good look at what's down here.

1056
01:24:09,000 --> 01:24:13,000
I might just die right now.

1057
01:24:13,000 --> 01:24:16,000
Can I box like that?

1058
01:24:16,000 --> 01:24:18,000
I wonder if I...

1059
01:24:18,000 --> 01:24:21,000
I think I can.

1060
01:24:28,000 --> 01:24:29,000
I can.

1061
01:24:29,000 --> 01:24:32,000
See you later.

1062
01:24:35,000 --> 01:24:36,000
That was...

1063
01:24:36,000 --> 01:24:37,000
I like that level.

1064
01:24:37,000 --> 01:24:39,000
That was really cool.

1065
01:24:41,000 --> 01:24:45,000
That was a very interesting level.

1066
01:24:47,000 --> 01:24:49,000
You can butt-slide everything?

1067
01:24:49,000 --> 01:24:51,000
Yeah, you probably can.

1068
01:24:51,000 --> 01:24:55,000
Let me see what he's writing to me.

1069
01:24:58,000 --> 01:25:00,000
All right.

1070
01:25:00,000 --> 01:25:02,000
I got stars levels.

1071
01:25:02,000 --> 01:25:03,000
I get it.

1072
01:25:03,000 --> 01:25:04,000
I get it.

1073
01:25:04,000 --> 01:25:05,000
I get it.

1074
01:25:05,000 --> 01:25:08,000
Now you just maybe die.

1075
01:25:08,000 --> 01:25:10,000
God, we get it.

1076
01:25:10,000 --> 01:25:12,000
You want me to play your level?

1077
01:25:12,000 --> 01:25:15,000
Could blow up my phone.

1078
01:25:15,000 --> 01:25:19,000
I have no idea.

1079
01:25:19,000 --> 01:25:23,000
I guess you just have to...

1080
01:25:31,000 --> 01:25:33,000
Holy shit.

1081
01:25:33,000 --> 01:25:36,000
Sure got a lot of stuff going on here, man.

1082
01:25:43,000 --> 01:25:46,000
Too scared to move.

1083
01:25:46,000 --> 01:25:47,000
No.

1084
01:25:47,000 --> 01:25:49,000
That's it.

1085
01:25:49,000 --> 01:25:54,000
Oh my god.

1086
01:25:54,000 --> 01:25:56,000
All right.

1087
01:25:56,000 --> 01:25:59,000
We're gonna play stars level.

1088
01:25:59,000 --> 01:26:02,000
Because this one's out of control.

1089
01:26:05,000 --> 01:26:06,000
Take him quick.

1090
01:26:06,000 --> 01:26:07,000
Sure.

1091
01:26:07,000 --> 01:26:10,000
Why not?

1092
01:26:13,000 --> 01:26:16,000
So...

1093
01:26:18,000 --> 01:26:22,000
Oh, core spot.

1094
01:26:22,000 --> 01:26:25,000
What does the core spot even do?

1095
01:26:25,000 --> 01:26:28,000
How do you just put in a...

1096
01:26:28,000 --> 01:26:31,000
Of course.

1097
01:26:34,000 --> 01:26:38,000
You just go to Maker or something?

1098
01:26:48,000 --> 01:26:51,000
Okay, there we go.

1099
01:26:51,000 --> 01:26:53,000
So here you go, guys.

1100
01:26:53,000 --> 01:26:56,000
Here's your star level number one.

1101
01:27:00,000 --> 01:27:03,000
What the fuck?

1102
01:27:10,000 --> 01:27:13,000
Hmm.

1103
01:27:13,000 --> 01:27:16,000
Not as zero as in this one.

1104
01:27:24,000 --> 01:27:27,000
All right.

1105
01:27:27,000 --> 01:27:30,000
This is called Pound Town.

1106
01:27:30,000 --> 01:27:33,000
Oh, this is actually Ashley's level.

1107
01:27:33,000 --> 01:27:35,000
This is not star's level, I don't think.

1108
01:27:35,000 --> 01:27:37,000
Maybe it is.

1109
01:27:37,000 --> 01:27:41,000
Maybe he just didn't change his avatar.

1110
01:27:41,000 --> 01:27:44,000
All right, Pound Town.

1111
01:27:44,000 --> 01:27:46,000
Whoa, almost got me.

1112
01:27:46,000 --> 01:27:49,000
Yeah, almost had me there.

1113
01:27:50,000 --> 01:27:55,000
Ooh, again, again, again.

1114
01:27:55,000 --> 01:27:58,000
No, he tell me.

1115
01:27:58,000 --> 01:27:59,000
See?

1116
01:27:59,000 --> 01:28:02,000
He thought I was gonna fall for it again.

1117
01:28:02,000 --> 01:28:05,000
He's gotta be something in this last one.

1118
01:28:05,000 --> 01:28:07,000
No.

1119
01:28:07,000 --> 01:28:10,000
Ooh, sacred blocks.

1120
01:28:10,000 --> 01:28:12,000
And a star.

1121
01:28:12,000 --> 01:28:16,000
We're just gonna go up.

1122
01:28:16,000 --> 01:28:17,000
No, we're not.

1123
01:28:17,000 --> 01:28:20,000
We're going right back down.

1124
01:28:20,000 --> 01:28:23,000
We're going right back down.

1125
01:28:23,000 --> 01:28:26,000
I could have used that star.

1126
01:28:26,000 --> 01:28:27,000
What else is back here?

1127
01:28:27,000 --> 01:28:29,000
Let's explore the rest of it.

1128
01:28:29,000 --> 01:28:32,000
Okay, jumpy springy.

1129
01:28:32,000 --> 01:28:35,000
Lots of spikes.

1130
01:28:35,000 --> 01:28:41,000
Put this here.

1131
01:28:41,000 --> 01:28:44,000
Now let's go right there.

1132
01:28:44,000 --> 01:28:48,000
No, put it down.

1133
01:28:48,000 --> 01:28:50,000
Another little...

1134
01:28:50,000 --> 01:28:57,000
Ooh, this is a fly thing.

1135
01:28:57,000 --> 01:28:59,000
What else is over here?

1136
01:28:59,000 --> 01:29:03,000
Interesting spikes, a bullet bill.

1137
01:29:03,000 --> 01:29:06,000
Get out of here.

1138
01:29:06,000 --> 01:29:07,000
Look at this.

1139
01:29:07,000 --> 01:29:08,000
Look at this.

1140
01:29:08,000 --> 01:29:10,000
This is this is this is.

1141
01:29:10,000 --> 01:29:12,000
That was a little bit of a thought to do.

1142
01:29:12,000 --> 01:29:17,000
This is a little bit of a success.

1143
01:29:17,000 --> 01:29:22,000
Ooh, I didn't really even notice that one.

1144
01:29:22,000 --> 01:29:28,000
Get out of here.

1145
01:29:28,000 --> 01:29:31,000
I didn't even need it.

1146
01:29:31,000 --> 01:29:35,000
How long does this level take you?

1147
01:29:35,000 --> 01:29:38,000
Whoa.

1148
01:29:38,000 --> 01:29:40,000
It's gonna happen again.

1149
01:29:40,000 --> 01:29:43,000
It's gonna be a little bit of a trouble.

1150
01:29:43,000 --> 01:29:46,000
I'm not gonna do that one this time.

1151
01:29:46,000 --> 01:29:47,000
There we go.

1152
01:29:47,000 --> 01:29:50,000
There's the mushroom I was looking for.

1153
01:29:50,000 --> 01:29:55,000
Now I can't get this.

1154
01:29:55,000 --> 01:29:58,000
I'll take some damage.

1155
01:29:58,000 --> 01:30:03,000
I'm gonna go back up there.

1156
01:30:04,000 --> 01:30:05,000
Why not?

1157
01:30:05,000 --> 01:30:10,000
Sorry, I'm gonna go back up there.

1158
01:30:10,000 --> 01:30:12,000
I guess I can't.

1159
01:30:12,000 --> 01:30:13,000
No, I can't.

1160
01:30:13,000 --> 01:30:15,000
There's the middle one, right?

1161
01:30:15,000 --> 01:30:19,000
Yes it was.

1162
01:30:19,000 --> 01:30:26,000
Hmm.

1163
01:30:26,000 --> 01:30:31,000
Let's move.

1164
01:30:31,000 --> 01:30:33,000
Actually I don't even need that right now.

1165
01:30:33,000 --> 01:30:34,000
I can just do this.

1166
01:30:34,000 --> 01:30:41,000
Huh.

1167
01:30:41,000 --> 01:30:45,000
Oh my god, why would I look over?

1168
01:30:45,000 --> 01:30:48,000
Why did I look over at my monitor to read the chat?

1169
01:30:48,000 --> 01:30:52,000
I saw a star set something in mid-jump I looked over and was like, what do you say?

1170
01:30:52,000 --> 01:31:00,000
That was not smart at all.

1171
01:31:01,000 --> 01:31:06,000
Hit me.

1172
01:31:06,000 --> 01:31:07,000
Oh shit.

1173
01:31:07,000 --> 01:31:13,000
I waited like way too long.

1174
01:31:13,000 --> 01:31:15,000
I don't even need to do that.

1175
01:31:15,000 --> 01:31:17,000
Let's just go.

1176
01:31:17,000 --> 01:31:19,000
We saw all the sites.

1177
01:31:19,000 --> 01:31:22,000
We can leave now.

1178
01:31:22,000 --> 01:31:23,000
Maybe we can't.

1179
01:31:23,000 --> 01:31:24,000
No, we're not.

1180
01:31:24,000 --> 01:31:26,000
We're not gonna leave that.

1181
01:31:26,000 --> 01:31:29,000
We're gonna get the thing that's in there.

1182
01:31:29,000 --> 01:31:34,000
I'm gonna get the thing that's in there.

1183
01:31:34,000 --> 01:31:44,000
It's so easy to get the star and just sprint through everything.

1184
01:31:44,000 --> 01:31:51,000
Run.

1185
01:31:51,000 --> 01:31:58,000
Ding dong.

1186
01:31:58,000 --> 01:32:03,000
Watch out for that thing again.

1187
01:32:03,000 --> 01:32:10,000
Don't jump into it.

1188
01:32:10,000 --> 01:32:11,000
I can't help.

1189
01:32:11,000 --> 01:32:12,000
Is there a secret up there?

1190
01:32:12,000 --> 01:32:20,000
Should I be aware of a secret?

1191
01:32:20,000 --> 01:32:23,000
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

1192
01:32:23,000 --> 01:32:29,000
We have to see what it is.

1193
01:32:29,000 --> 01:32:38,000
He's gonna keep deleting things, isn't he?

1194
01:32:38,000 --> 01:32:41,000
Where does this go?

1195
01:32:41,000 --> 01:32:46,000
What's gonna keep going?

1196
01:32:46,000 --> 01:32:49,000
He's gonna break this and then what do I gain from doing this?

1197
01:32:49,000 --> 01:32:54,000
Nothing?

1198
01:32:54,000 --> 01:32:56,000
I guess there's just nothing here.

1199
01:32:56,000 --> 01:32:58,000
Maybe I could just go on the pipe.

1200
01:32:58,000 --> 01:33:00,000
Can I even, am I gonna make that?

1201
01:33:00,000 --> 01:33:06,000
Find out.

1202
01:33:06,000 --> 01:33:08,000
Oh yeah, it's right.

1203
01:33:08,000 --> 01:33:11,000
You go back to the start.

1204
01:33:11,000 --> 01:33:13,000
Oh, that's cool.

1205
01:33:13,000 --> 01:33:15,000
All right, well, I got to the end of that one.

1206
01:33:15,000 --> 01:33:19,000
I wanted to see what was in your secret troll pipe.

1207
01:33:19,000 --> 01:33:21,000
Let's do the other one.

1208
01:33:21,000 --> 01:33:29,000
There's two more.

1209
01:33:29,000 --> 01:33:31,000
So who was that yours?

1210
01:33:31,000 --> 01:33:39,000
Was that Ashley's?

1211
01:33:39,000 --> 01:33:44,000
I don't know how to rate it.

1212
01:33:44,000 --> 01:33:53,000
Yeah, you're gonna do something with that pipe?

1213
01:33:53,000 --> 01:34:01,000
Because I mean, is that pipe just designed for you to go run all the way backwards?

1214
01:34:01,000 --> 01:34:05,000
Or is your plan to put something else there?

1215
01:34:05,000 --> 01:34:13,000
Like a one-up mushroom?

1216
01:34:13,000 --> 01:34:24,000
Here's another star level.

1217
01:34:24,000 --> 01:34:33,000
Six, two, three.

1218
01:34:33,000 --> 01:34:35,000
Firetown.

1219
01:34:35,000 --> 01:34:39,000
Very creative with these names, by the way.

1220
01:34:39,000 --> 01:34:43,000
Firetown, pound town.

1221
01:34:43,000 --> 01:34:53,000
You got, you get really good with these cities.

1222
01:34:53,000 --> 01:34:56,000
You gonna do that to me the whole level?

1223
01:34:56,000 --> 01:35:01,000
Kidding me.

1224
01:35:01,000 --> 01:35:06,000
Okay, so I'm safe if I, no, those go, I'm, I'm gonna miss, all right, I'm gonna rush a bit.

1225
01:35:06,000 --> 01:35:12,000
I'll slow those things work.

1226
01:35:12,000 --> 01:35:17,000
What else is in here?

1227
01:35:17,000 --> 01:35:20,000
Oh, whoa, easy.

1228
01:35:20,000 --> 01:35:25,000
Easy with the hidden block there, buddy.

1229
01:35:25,000 --> 01:35:27,000
Look at that. Look what he's doing here.

1230
01:35:27,000 --> 01:35:32,000
He thinks he's such a clever little shit, doesn't he?

1231
01:35:32,000 --> 01:35:35,000
I don't know what that is at a wall.

1232
01:35:35,000 --> 01:35:38,000
Can't tell if he's at a wall.

1233
01:35:38,000 --> 01:35:45,000
No, it's not.

1234
01:35:45,000 --> 01:35:50,000
You see that was just very good, very good.

1235
01:35:50,000 --> 01:35:54,000
I'm a fan of this level because of that, you know, that be careful.

1236
01:35:54,000 --> 01:35:57,000
You could get hit by this shit.

1237
01:35:57,000 --> 01:35:59,000
Very nice, very nice.

1238
01:35:59,000 --> 01:36:04,000
I'm enjoying it.

1239
01:36:04,000 --> 01:36:06,000
See, I didn't time that right, I forgot.

1240
01:36:06,000 --> 01:36:10,000
I didn't realize that we're on the different spectrums.

1241
01:36:10,000 --> 01:36:14,000
What was the first one come up right there?

1242
01:36:14,000 --> 01:36:22,000
I don't know, I forget what these enemies do.

1243
01:36:22,000 --> 01:36:24,000
Can I destroy them by going like this?

1244
01:36:24,000 --> 01:36:30,000
No, I can do that.

1245
01:36:30,000 --> 01:36:34,000
Whoa.

1246
01:36:34,000 --> 01:36:43,000
Very, very clever, very nice.

1247
01:36:43,000 --> 01:36:47,000
What else we got?

1248
01:36:47,000 --> 01:36:51,000
Anything else down here?

1249
01:36:51,000 --> 01:36:54,000
Get a dangerous mushroom.

1250
01:36:54,000 --> 01:36:57,000
Those are going to keep coming all the way, aren't they?

1251
01:36:57,000 --> 01:37:04,000
They're going to start exploding.

1252
01:37:04,000 --> 01:37:06,000
Ah, I got two cocky.

1253
01:37:06,000 --> 01:37:11,000
I got two cocky there, I should have waited.

1254
01:37:11,000 --> 01:37:16,000
Two cocky.

1255
01:37:16,000 --> 01:37:19,000
This one, I like this because this, what's with the bomb?

1256
01:37:19,000 --> 01:37:21,000
What's the bomb?

1257
01:37:21,000 --> 01:37:24,000
Whoa, whoa, whoa, what's with this broken bugged out fucking level?

1258
01:37:24,000 --> 01:37:28,000
What's with this broken buggy technical mess of a level?

1259
01:37:28,000 --> 01:37:33,000
That bomb guy came back and was there and ruined my run.

1260
01:37:33,000 --> 01:37:37,000
Actually, I probably just, could I do that?

1261
01:37:37,000 --> 01:37:40,000
That's very, very dangerous.

1262
01:37:40,000 --> 01:37:42,000
But it might be fun to try.

1263
01:37:42,000 --> 01:37:44,000
Do you, is this encouraged star?

1264
01:37:44,000 --> 01:37:47,000
Is this something you wanted to try to get people to do?

1265
01:37:47,000 --> 01:37:51,000
Three, one, two, three.

1266
01:37:51,000 --> 01:37:58,000
Now, I guess not.

1267
01:37:58,000 --> 01:38:01,000
I'm sure it's probably possible.

1268
01:38:01,000 --> 01:38:08,000
But not a probable thing to get every time I would assume.

1269
01:38:08,000 --> 01:38:16,000
Watch out!

1270
01:38:16,000 --> 01:38:31,000
You'd have a lot of patience with this.

1271
01:38:31,000 --> 01:38:54,000
I actually was trying to kill that guy.

1272
01:38:54,000 --> 01:38:58,000
I forgot, I guess you can't hit them.

1273
01:38:58,000 --> 01:39:14,000
Where's the shot?

1274
01:39:14,000 --> 01:39:19,000
Ooh, I just figured out what you are attending people to do here.

1275
01:39:19,000 --> 01:39:22,000
Interesting.

1276
01:39:22,000 --> 01:39:25,000
So you want to get somebody to blow that up.

1277
01:39:25,000 --> 01:39:27,000
Okay, that's cool.

1278
01:39:27,000 --> 01:39:29,000
You drop one down there and expose the wall.

1279
01:39:29,000 --> 01:39:30,000
You can get the mushroom if you want.

1280
01:39:30,000 --> 01:39:32,000
That's cool, dude.

1281
01:39:32,000 --> 01:39:35,000
Very cool.

1282
01:39:35,000 --> 01:39:37,000
And you got those shooting over.

1283
01:39:37,000 --> 01:39:41,000
Wow, you know, I'm impressed.

1284
01:39:41,000 --> 01:39:50,000
Doesn't do much.

1285
01:39:50,000 --> 01:39:53,000
Okay, apparently I hit that button twice.

1286
01:39:53,000 --> 01:39:55,000
That's the end right there.

1287
01:39:55,000 --> 01:39:57,000
Why the fuck did that happen?

1288
01:39:57,000 --> 01:39:59,000
It just went like, dude, dude.

1289
01:39:59,000 --> 01:40:00,000
Shouldn't have done that twice.

1290
01:40:00,000 --> 01:40:03,000
That was the end.

1291
01:40:03,000 --> 01:40:05,000
So you got to bring a bomb over.

1292
01:40:05,000 --> 01:40:11,000
Cool.

1293
01:40:11,000 --> 01:40:12,000
I swear, man.

1294
01:40:12,000 --> 01:40:19,000
I swear this controller does like fucking ghostly shit.

1295
01:40:20,000 --> 01:40:32,000
I'm telling you, these game pads are possessed by fucking Satan.

1296
01:40:32,000 --> 01:40:44,000
I was trying to save that.

1297
01:40:44,000 --> 01:40:46,000
I don't need the mushroom.

1298
01:40:46,000 --> 01:40:58,000
Oh, no, we're gonna fall.

1299
01:40:58,000 --> 01:41:01,000
Didn't do anything over here, did you?

1300
01:41:01,000 --> 01:41:08,000
No.

1301
01:41:08,000 --> 01:41:11,000
Oh, I guess trying to do the thing.

1302
01:41:11,000 --> 01:41:13,000
Oh, fuck, it showed up the other side.

1303
01:41:13,000 --> 01:41:19,000
I'm just sitting there waiting for it to explode.

1304
01:41:19,000 --> 01:41:22,000
I was sitting there waiting for it to explode.

1305
01:41:22,000 --> 01:41:29,000
Let's get out of here, bomb.

1306
01:41:52,000 --> 01:42:02,000
Woohoo!

1307
01:42:02,000 --> 01:42:11,000
Ha ha, I got him.

1308
01:42:11,000 --> 01:42:13,000
Not even to worry about that.

1309
01:42:13,000 --> 01:42:16,000
He can just dog.

1310
01:42:16,000 --> 01:42:18,000
I do see this fish here though.

1311
01:42:18,000 --> 01:42:25,000
I can't kill him with fire.

1312
01:42:25,000 --> 01:42:36,000
Oh, one of the feet.

1313
01:42:36,000 --> 01:42:43,000
Hot feet, hot foot.

1314
01:42:43,000 --> 01:42:47,000
Okay, I got to bring one.

1315
01:42:47,000 --> 01:42:51,000
I got to bring one.

1316
01:42:51,000 --> 01:42:58,000
I just have to kite him over here.

1317
01:42:58,000 --> 01:43:01,000
Yay!

1318
01:43:01,000 --> 01:43:07,000
All right, what weird shit did you put at Bowser?

1319
01:43:07,000 --> 01:43:09,000
Oh, I guess nothing.

1320
01:43:09,000 --> 01:43:14,000
That was cool though.

1321
01:43:14,000 --> 01:43:22,000
I like the bomb aspect of it.

1322
01:43:22,000 --> 01:43:32,000
I like the character development where the bomb comes out of the cannon and then start to flash red and finally explode.

1323
01:43:32,000 --> 01:43:35,000
All right, let's do Ashley's level now.

1324
01:43:35,000 --> 01:43:49,000
This is actually a town level as well.

1325
01:43:49,000 --> 01:44:01,000
We'll find out.

1326
01:44:01,000 --> 01:44:13,000
Watch him just really, really just get under my skin right here and just give me the code to a level that is one of the impossible ones.

1327
01:44:13,000 --> 01:44:14,000
Yeah, it's pretty easy.

1328
01:44:14,000 --> 01:44:15,000
Just give it a try.

1329
01:44:15,000 --> 01:44:21,000
It's pretty fun.

1330
01:44:21,000 --> 01:44:24,000
Spiny tank invasion.

1331
01:44:24,000 --> 01:44:32,000
You got it.

1332
01:44:32,000 --> 01:44:36,000
Whoa, we're already moving.

1333
01:44:36,000 --> 01:44:43,000
That was expected.

1334
01:44:43,000 --> 01:44:46,000
Wow!

1335
01:44:47,000 --> 01:44:52,000
So you got to go over, bounce, over, bounce.

1336
01:44:52,000 --> 01:45:01,000
Wow, okay, I did that way too early.

1337
01:45:01,000 --> 01:45:04,000
Shit!

1338
01:45:04,000 --> 01:45:09,000
This one's going to take a little bit of practice, I think.

1339
01:45:09,000 --> 01:45:15,000
Jesus!

1340
01:45:16,000 --> 01:45:21,000
Wow!

1341
01:45:21,000 --> 01:45:25,000
I don't know, Star.

1342
01:45:25,000 --> 01:45:31,000
I think this one might be harder than yours.

1343
01:45:31,000 --> 01:45:44,000
There we go.

1344
01:45:45,000 --> 01:45:48,000
Whoa!

1345
01:45:48,000 --> 01:45:51,000
Boy!

1346
01:45:51,000 --> 01:45:57,000
There's another thing to jump on.

1347
01:45:57,000 --> 01:46:06,000
Oh my goodness.

1348
01:46:06,000 --> 01:46:10,000
Oh my god!

1349
01:46:10,000 --> 01:46:21,000
That 140 second input delay is going to try to be crazy.

1350
01:46:21,000 --> 01:46:28,000
And no.

1351
01:46:28,000 --> 01:46:32,000
I didn't even do it.

1352
01:46:32,000 --> 01:46:36,000
Wow!

1353
01:46:36,000 --> 01:46:43,000
Who yikes?

1354
01:46:43,000 --> 01:46:50,000
Whoa!

1355
01:46:50,000 --> 01:46:57,000
This is hard.

1356
01:46:57,000 --> 01:47:12,000
I'm going to jump over that.

1357
01:47:12,000 --> 01:47:19,000
Now I did too early.

1358
01:47:20,000 --> 01:47:24,000
Too early.

1359
01:47:24,000 --> 01:47:29,000
Too early.

1360
01:47:29,000 --> 01:47:36,000
One more.

1361
01:47:36,000 --> 01:47:39,000
Holy shit!

1362
01:47:39,000 --> 01:47:46,000
Those are spaced differently as well.

1363
01:47:46,000 --> 01:47:53,000
Oh my god!

1364
01:47:53,000 --> 01:47:58,000
It's a B press B and you jump and it doesn't like to want to do.

1365
01:47:58,000 --> 01:48:05,000
It doesn't like to work its thing.

1366
01:48:05,000 --> 01:48:12,000
Find the hidden blocks.

1367
01:48:12,000 --> 01:48:17,000
Nope, that's it.

1368
01:48:17,000 --> 01:48:24,000
I can't go over it.

1369
01:48:24,000 --> 01:48:31,000
Jump.

1370
01:48:31,000 --> 01:48:37,000
Oh my god!

1371
01:48:37,000 --> 01:48:57,000
The spacing on those is so perfect for you to lose.

1372
01:48:57,000 --> 01:49:04,000
That is an evil evil evil shit.

1373
01:49:04,000 --> 01:49:10,000
I waited too long.

1374
01:49:10,000 --> 01:49:25,000
So you got to hit the second one on the last one, don't you?

1375
01:49:25,000 --> 01:49:32,000
I'll get it.

1376
01:49:32,000 --> 01:49:39,000
I will get it, don't worry.

1377
01:49:39,000 --> 01:49:46,000
Whoa!

1378
01:49:46,000 --> 01:49:49,000
I got it.

1379
01:49:49,000 --> 01:49:52,000
I don't know.

1380
01:49:52,000 --> 01:49:59,000
I haven't trouble with that last one.

1381
01:49:59,000 --> 01:50:06,000
Maybe I should jump first.

1382
01:50:06,000 --> 01:50:12,000
Yeah, that maybe.

1383
01:50:12,000 --> 01:50:19,000
Oh, that was unnecessary.

1384
01:50:19,000 --> 01:50:25,000
Jump.

1385
01:50:25,000 --> 01:50:33,000
Oh my god!

1386
01:50:33,000 --> 01:50:39,000
So you have to land on the first one, I guess.

1387
01:50:39,000 --> 01:50:46,000
What the fuck?

1388
01:50:46,000 --> 01:50:49,000
What is going on right now?

1389
01:50:49,000 --> 01:51:00,000
Why do I keep hitting the side of this right now?

1390
01:51:00,000 --> 01:51:07,000
There we are.

1391
01:51:07,000 --> 01:51:14,000
No, it didn't do it.

1392
01:51:14,000 --> 01:51:19,000
Run the fucking recording back.

1393
01:51:19,000 --> 01:51:24,000
Listen to me press the fucking button and it didn't work.

1394
01:51:24,000 --> 01:51:28,000
Run it back.

1395
01:51:28,000 --> 01:51:34,000
You'll hear it and you'll go, oh my god, he's right.

1396
01:51:34,000 --> 01:51:41,000
I did it.

1397
01:51:41,000 --> 01:51:51,000
Yeah, check the tape on that one, you'll be like, oh shit.

1398
01:51:51,000 --> 01:51:55,000
The gamepad is a bad controller, it has like three frames of lag.

1399
01:51:55,000 --> 01:51:57,000
I know it sucks.

1400
01:51:57,000 --> 01:51:59,000
It sucks using this thing.

1401
01:51:59,000 --> 01:52:06,000
But until I get a plugged in controller, I have to deal with it.

1402
01:52:06,000 --> 01:52:10,000
Look, I cleared it.

1403
01:52:10,000 --> 01:52:12,000
50 attempts.

1404
01:52:12,000 --> 01:52:14,000
I did it.

1405
01:52:14,000 --> 01:52:17,000
Oh, is that, did I didn't do 50 attempts?

1406
01:52:17,000 --> 01:52:27,000
Did I do no?

1407
01:52:27,000 --> 01:52:29,000
Did you beat this one?

1408
01:52:29,000 --> 01:52:31,000
Why didn't you beat this one, Star?

1409
01:52:31,000 --> 01:52:52,000
What the heck?

1410
01:52:52,000 --> 01:52:54,000
What else is here?

1411
01:52:54,000 --> 01:52:59,000
Do you guys have any more levels?

1412
01:52:59,000 --> 01:53:11,000
Why am I not skyping or in a call with Star?

1413
01:53:11,000 --> 01:53:21,000
Because the audio delay is so long when you're capping a console that I have to offset it.

1414
01:53:21,000 --> 01:53:32,000
So he'd cover it and he'd react to things like four seconds too late.

1415
01:53:32,000 --> 01:53:35,000
I wonder if there's a game mode on this TV?

1416
01:53:35,000 --> 01:53:39,000
Isn't there something to do with TV sometimes too?

1417
01:53:39,000 --> 01:53:42,000
Do they have problems playing games?

1418
01:53:42,000 --> 01:53:44,000
If they're not like a certain setting?

1419
01:53:44,000 --> 01:53:45,000
I wonder.

1420
01:53:45,000 --> 01:53:49,000
Let me just check.

1421
01:53:49,000 --> 01:53:51,000
I wonder if this has a game mode on it.

1422
01:53:51,000 --> 01:53:58,000
That would be interesting if it did.

1423
01:53:58,000 --> 01:54:06,000
Let's see.

1424
01:54:06,000 --> 01:54:08,000
Noise reduction.

1425
01:54:08,000 --> 01:54:12,000
Why would I want noise reduction?

1426
01:54:19,000 --> 01:54:42,000
I don't think this TV has any of those problems.

1427
01:54:42,000 --> 01:54:45,000
I don't think it has anything for it.

1428
01:54:45,000 --> 01:54:56,000
I know that can be a problem.

1429
01:54:56,000 --> 01:55:03,000
What's featured today?

1430
01:55:03,000 --> 01:55:09,000
Let's take a look.

1431
01:55:09,000 --> 01:55:12,000
This one has a lot of...

1432
01:55:12,000 --> 01:55:15,000
Oh, I don't like...

1433
01:55:15,000 --> 01:55:18,000
12,000 attempts.

1434
01:55:18,000 --> 01:55:22,000
12,000 attempts and only 123 clears.

1435
01:55:22,000 --> 01:55:24,000
I don't think I shouldn't be doing this.

1436
01:55:24,000 --> 01:55:32,000
There's a hundred comments that probably all swear.

1437
01:55:32,000 --> 01:55:34,000
You probably won't read this good night, Jerma.

1438
01:55:34,000 --> 01:55:35,000
Have a good one.

1439
01:55:35,000 --> 01:55:36,000
You too.

1440
01:55:36,000 --> 01:55:38,000
Thanks for coming.

1441
01:55:38,000 --> 01:55:47,000
I can delay the audio coming in from me.

1442
01:55:47,000 --> 01:55:56,000
But that didn't let him his head.

1443
01:55:56,000 --> 01:56:03,000
Look at all those X's.

1444
01:56:03,000 --> 01:56:16,000
I got a stagger in there.

1445
01:56:16,000 --> 01:56:19,000
Wow.

1446
01:56:19,000 --> 01:56:21,000
How do you turn off comments?

1447
01:56:21,000 --> 01:56:23,000
Maybe that'll help me see things.

1448
01:56:23,000 --> 01:56:26,000
Is there a way to do it?

1449
01:56:26,000 --> 01:56:27,000
Oh, comment.

1450
01:56:27,000 --> 01:56:32,000
That's how you make a comment.

1451
01:56:32,000 --> 01:56:35,000
There we go.

1452
01:56:35,000 --> 01:56:38,000
Oh, that one's toast.

1453
01:56:38,000 --> 01:56:45,000
Yeah, I looked up some tutorials, Ronnie, to see...

1454
01:56:45,000 --> 01:56:49,000
Not a stagger.

1455
01:56:49,000 --> 01:56:54,000
There was a few tutorials explaining how to do it, but still...

1456
01:56:54,000 --> 01:57:01,000
I wish I had an explanation for why that happened.

1457
01:57:01,000 --> 01:57:07,000
If I could explain to you why that just happened, I would...

1458
01:57:07,000 --> 01:57:12,000
I would block him.

1459
01:57:12,000 --> 01:57:21,000
Yikes.

1460
01:57:21,000 --> 01:57:34,000
Oh, dear.

1461
01:57:34,000 --> 01:57:41,000
Oh, dear.

1462
01:57:41,000 --> 01:57:43,000
Oh, boy.

1463
01:57:43,000 --> 01:57:48,000
So, this level with the 12,000 attempts and the 1% clear rate...

1464
01:57:48,000 --> 01:57:51,000
I think I just wanted to see what it was.

1465
01:57:51,000 --> 01:58:02,000
I'll give it like maybe 5 or 10 more attempts.

1466
01:58:02,000 --> 01:58:04,000
Geez.

1467
01:58:04,000 --> 01:58:05,000
Just that alone.

1468
01:58:05,000 --> 01:58:09,000
I probably shouldn't even do that second the last jump.

1469
01:58:09,000 --> 01:58:16,000
Oh.

1470
01:58:17,000 --> 01:58:26,000
That happened again.

1471
01:58:26,000 --> 01:58:33,000
Is it just because the big brick gamepad has the tiny, tiny, tiny little analog,

1472
01:58:33,000 --> 01:58:35,000
not analog, the D-pad?

1473
01:58:35,000 --> 01:58:42,000
Maybe my big ass thumb is pressing every single button because the D-pad is as big as a thumb.

1474
01:58:42,000 --> 01:58:45,000
Next time you're playing on this big brick, hold your thumb up.

1475
01:58:45,000 --> 01:58:50,000
It's going to take over the entire D-pad.

1476
01:58:50,000 --> 01:58:57,000
Is it good that it's big enough for one button for you to press?

1477
01:59:06,000 --> 01:59:10,000
Shit.

1478
01:59:10,000 --> 01:59:22,000
I could get there.

1479
01:59:22,000 --> 01:59:29,000
I wasn't breaking the button.

1480
01:59:29,000 --> 01:59:36,000
I'm not going to do that.

1481
01:59:36,000 --> 01:59:43,000
I'm not going to do that.

1482
01:59:43,000 --> 01:59:48,000
I'm not going to do that.

1483
01:59:48,000 --> 02:00:01,000
Oh, I missed it.

1484
02:00:01,000 --> 02:00:05,000
I missed it.

1485
02:00:05,000 --> 02:00:09,000
I had that.

1486
02:00:09,000 --> 02:00:15,000
I was going pretty well too.

1487
02:00:15,000 --> 02:00:18,000
I should be using literally anything but the gamepad.

1488
02:00:18,000 --> 02:00:21,000
I don't have anything.

1489
02:00:21,000 --> 02:00:26,000
The only thing I have is the Wii U, the standard Wii mode.

1490
02:00:26,000 --> 02:00:33,000
I've heard that's just as bad.

1491
02:00:33,000 --> 02:00:36,000
There's a way to get that.

1492
02:00:36,000 --> 02:00:39,000
I've already lost it.

1493
02:00:39,000 --> 02:00:42,000
I'm just going to like this.

1494
02:00:42,000 --> 02:00:54,000
I probably could have.

1495
02:00:54,000 --> 02:01:02,000
Come on, no, stop doing that.

1496
02:01:02,000 --> 02:01:05,000
I don't know why I'm still doing this.

1497
02:01:05,000 --> 02:01:11,000
I really feel like I can do this.

1498
02:01:11,000 --> 02:01:20,000
Oh boy, I should just get it so I can take a hit.

1499
02:01:20,000 --> 02:01:24,000
I don't know why that doesn't work at the time.

1500
02:01:24,000 --> 02:01:26,000
I'll have to come back to this level.

1501
02:01:26,000 --> 02:01:29,000
Once I get a control, I'll come back.

1502
02:01:29,000 --> 02:01:35,000
We'll do one or two more attempts.

1503
02:01:35,000 --> 02:01:39,000
I have to damage this.

1504
02:01:39,000 --> 02:01:45,000
The whole way to land and then jump within 30 milliseconds.

1505
02:01:45,000 --> 02:01:56,000
I wish there was a way.

1506
02:01:56,000 --> 02:02:08,000
I'm just going to get that.

1507
02:02:08,000 --> 02:02:12,000
Holy shit, go down, please.

1508
02:02:12,000 --> 02:02:13,000
Still scrolling?

1509
02:02:13,000 --> 02:02:16,000
Well, I don't know what's happening.

1510
02:02:16,000 --> 02:02:18,000
Oh, I just freaked out.

1511
02:02:18,000 --> 02:02:19,000
I just don't know what's going on.

1512
02:02:19,000 --> 02:02:21,000
It was disco.

1513
02:02:21,000 --> 02:02:23,000
Do you see the disco party that was happening?

1514
02:02:23,000 --> 02:02:33,000
I don't know if that was how it would go.

1515
02:02:33,000 --> 02:02:35,000
I think I just figured it out.

1516
02:02:35,000 --> 02:02:39,000
I think you have to jump into it.

1517
02:02:39,000 --> 02:02:41,000
Well, that's how it always happens.

1518
02:02:41,000 --> 02:02:47,000
One or two more attempts and then you're playing for like two hours.

1519
02:02:47,000 --> 02:02:52,000
Please, let me attach and jump.

1520
02:02:52,000 --> 02:02:55,000
Is the pro controller is good, right?

1521
02:02:55,000 --> 02:02:57,000
For the wheel?

1522
02:02:57,000 --> 02:03:03,000
Or should I get the classic, the original classic controller?

1523
02:03:03,000 --> 02:03:15,000
I almost screwed that up.

1524
02:03:15,000 --> 02:03:23,000
Okay.

1525
02:03:23,000 --> 02:03:29,000
That's all I had to do.

1526
02:03:29,000 --> 02:03:36,000
This is over here.

1527
02:03:36,000 --> 02:03:49,000
Oh, one of these.

1528
02:03:49,000 --> 02:03:55,000
I feel like a wow.

1529
02:03:55,000 --> 02:03:59,000
Oh, come on.

1530
02:03:59,000 --> 02:04:01,000
Okay, this is the final.

1531
02:04:01,000 --> 02:04:04,000
No, no, no, this is the final attempt.

1532
02:04:04,000 --> 02:04:07,000
Final attempt.

1533
02:04:07,000 --> 02:04:12,000
Last one.

1534
02:04:12,000 --> 02:04:19,000
Final attempt.

1535
02:04:19,000 --> 02:04:29,000
Jump, please, you fucking slug.

1536
02:04:29,000 --> 02:04:31,000
No, that one didn't count.

1537
02:04:31,000 --> 02:04:33,000
That one doesn't count.

1538
02:04:33,000 --> 02:04:36,000
I have to get back to that like last part.

1539
02:04:36,000 --> 02:04:39,000
Very the one I was just at.

1540
02:04:39,000 --> 02:04:43,000
That one didn't count.

1541
02:04:43,000 --> 02:04:50,000
That one didn't count.

1542
02:04:50,000 --> 02:04:58,000
I'll say I get it.

1543
02:04:58,000 --> 02:04:59,000
But I didn't get it.

1544
02:04:59,000 --> 02:05:02,000
That's how you get it, but I didn't get it.

1545
02:05:02,000 --> 02:05:05,000
Never let it end.

1546
02:05:05,000 --> 02:05:08,000
No, it has to end very soon.

1547
02:05:08,000 --> 02:05:13,000
Before I have a fucking heart attack.

1548
02:05:13,000 --> 02:05:15,000
I'm trying to stagger it.

1549
02:05:15,000 --> 02:05:16,000
Oh, my god.

1550
02:05:16,000 --> 02:05:22,000
Add me to like the 2000 attempts to this.

1551
02:05:22,000 --> 02:05:23,000
It's too addicting.

1552
02:05:23,000 --> 02:05:26,000
It's too addicting to play these extremely difficult,

1553
02:05:26,000 --> 02:05:30,000
say I'm speaking.

1554
02:05:30,000 --> 02:05:33,000
I'm just getting these difficult levels.

1555
02:05:33,000 --> 02:05:34,000
Something about it.

1556
02:05:34,000 --> 02:05:38,000
It scratches some weird fucking dumb fucked up itch in your brain.

1557
02:05:38,000 --> 02:05:41,000
You just have to keep doing it.

1558
02:05:41,000 --> 02:05:45,000
I just have to keep going.

1559
02:05:45,000 --> 02:05:49,000
I can quit, I can quit wherever I want.

1560
02:05:49,000 --> 02:05:56,000
Wow, wow, now I'm just getting really, really, really, really, really sloppy.

1561
02:05:56,000 --> 02:06:04,000
What am I doing wrong here?

1562
02:06:04,000 --> 02:06:11,000
What am I doing wrong here?

1563
02:06:11,000 --> 02:06:22,000
That's what I wanted to do.

1564
02:06:22,000 --> 02:06:25,000
I didn't want this to be even more difficult now.

1565
02:06:25,000 --> 02:06:26,000
Oh boy, what?

1566
02:06:26,000 --> 02:06:32,000
What was that?

1567
02:06:32,000 --> 02:06:34,000
Holy shit, where am I?

1568
02:06:34,000 --> 02:06:35,000
What happened?

1569
02:06:35,000 --> 02:06:36,000
What the fuck?

1570
02:06:36,000 --> 02:06:37,000
That's the end.

1571
02:06:37,000 --> 02:06:38,000
That's the end of the level.

1572
02:06:38,000 --> 02:06:39,000
That's the very end.

1573
02:06:39,000 --> 02:06:40,000
That's the very end of the fucking level.

1574
02:06:40,000 --> 02:06:41,000
That's, I beat it.

1575
02:06:41,000 --> 02:06:42,000
That's the end.

1576
02:06:42,000 --> 02:06:46,000
That's the end of the level.

1577
02:06:46,000 --> 02:06:50,000
Do you see that?

1578
02:06:50,000 --> 02:06:57,000
I'm freaking out right now, that's the end.

1579
02:06:57,000 --> 02:07:04,000
I just did it.

1580
02:07:04,000 --> 02:07:05,000
I did it.

1581
02:07:05,000 --> 02:07:06,000
I beat the level.

1582
02:07:06,000 --> 02:07:07,000
It's over.

1583
02:07:07,000 --> 02:07:08,000
I won.

1584
02:07:08,000 --> 02:07:15,000
Okay.

1585
02:07:15,000 --> 02:07:17,000
I just beat it.

1586
02:07:17,000 --> 02:07:18,000
I beat the level.

1587
02:07:18,000 --> 02:07:19,000
It's over.

1588
02:07:19,000 --> 02:07:20,000
I won.

1589
02:07:20,000 --> 02:07:23,000
Okay.

1590
02:07:23,000 --> 02:07:29,000
I just beat it.

1591
02:07:29,000 --> 02:07:32,000
Very cool.

1592
02:07:32,000 --> 02:07:37,000
Yeah, that was a fun one.

1593
02:07:37,000 --> 02:07:44,000
Yeah.

1594
02:07:44,000 --> 02:07:49,000
Not even hard.

1595
02:07:49,000 --> 02:07:50,000
Not even hard.

1596
02:07:50,000 --> 02:08:05,000
One person said, if only we all were bad enough to fall down that hole to find that.

1597
02:08:05,000 --> 02:08:06,000
I want to, can I, can you see?

1598
02:08:06,000 --> 02:08:07,000
I want to download it.

1599
02:08:07,000 --> 02:08:08,000
I can download this, right?

1600
02:08:08,000 --> 02:08:09,000
I take a look at it.

1601
02:08:09,000 --> 02:08:12,000
Because I'm curious as to like what the outs is there.

1602
02:08:12,000 --> 02:08:19,000
I'm going to put it here.

1603
02:08:19,000 --> 02:08:21,000
I want to take a look at that.

1604
02:08:21,000 --> 02:08:29,000
Because if you do it the right way, I wonder.

1605
02:08:29,000 --> 02:08:33,000
That's fine.

1606
02:08:33,000 --> 02:08:35,000
Let's take a look here.

1607
02:08:35,000 --> 02:08:37,000
Because here's, okay, you jump over this.

1608
02:08:37,000 --> 02:08:40,000
Bang, bang, blank, blank, blank, up here.

1609
02:08:40,000 --> 02:08:41,000
Watch out for this.

1610
02:08:41,000 --> 02:08:42,000
Watch out for that.

1611
02:08:42,000 --> 02:08:47,000
Oh no, we're going to be going, don't, don't, don't, don't, don't, don't, don't, don't, don't.

1612
02:08:47,000 --> 02:08:49,000
And then in here.

1613
02:08:49,000 --> 02:08:50,000
Okay.

1614
02:08:50,000 --> 02:08:55,000
You can go down here, too.

1615
02:08:55,000 --> 02:08:56,000
Really.

1616
02:08:56,000 --> 02:09:02,000
That's interesting.

1617
02:09:03,000 --> 02:09:12,000
Put it in there.

1618
02:09:12,000 --> 02:09:13,000
How do you make him like go in?

1619
02:09:13,000 --> 02:09:14,000
How do you get to the name?

1620
02:09:14,000 --> 02:09:17,000
I haven't been really playing with this particular part.

1621
02:09:17,000 --> 02:09:19,000
How do I get him like to go in here?

1622
02:09:19,000 --> 02:09:27,000
No, no, no, don't do that.

1623
02:09:27,000 --> 02:09:31,000
Can I just like place him here and he'll go in?

1624
02:09:31,000 --> 02:09:38,000
I haven't even had the opportunity to do this.

1625
02:09:38,000 --> 02:09:45,000
I guess I could just play test it, yeah.

1626
02:09:45,000 --> 02:09:48,000
All right, hold on.

1627
02:09:48,000 --> 02:09:49,000
So how much more?

1628
02:09:49,000 --> 02:09:51,000
Look, there's a lot more.

1629
02:09:51,000 --> 02:09:54,000
If you go through this whole thing, you don't have to do any of this.

1630
02:09:54,000 --> 02:09:56,000
This, I go all the way around this.

1631
02:09:56,000 --> 02:09:58,000
My god, look at this shit, look at this.

1632
02:09:58,000 --> 02:10:00,000
This is why it's 1%.

1633
02:10:00,000 --> 02:10:05,000
Look at how much you have to go through.

1634
02:10:05,000 --> 02:10:08,000
This is where I think you'd be holding up most people.

1635
02:10:08,000 --> 02:10:12,000
This is because they shoot the crap out.

1636
02:10:12,000 --> 02:10:16,000
And all the spikes and everything.

1637
02:10:16,000 --> 02:10:22,000
And getting back there must just be so annoying every time.

1638
02:10:22,000 --> 02:10:23,000
There's another cloud right there, too.

1639
02:10:23,000 --> 02:10:25,000
Just in case you fail here and have to stop.

1640
02:10:25,000 --> 02:10:26,000
What are these things?

1641
02:10:26,000 --> 02:10:29,000
Those are the chumps.

1642
02:10:30,000 --> 02:10:32,000
Let's just do it.

1643
02:10:32,000 --> 02:10:33,000
Let me see.

1644
02:10:33,000 --> 02:10:36,000
I'm interested.

1645
02:10:41,000 --> 02:10:45,000
I was waiting for him to move.

1646
02:10:45,000 --> 02:10:49,000
I was waiting for them to move.

1647
02:10:49,000 --> 02:10:51,000
Did that well they move?

1648
02:10:51,000 --> 02:10:56,000
I hope that they did like the raw, raw, raw, raw and launch at you.

1649
02:10:57,000 --> 02:10:59,000
Apparently these ones don't.

1650
02:11:04,000 --> 02:11:05,000
Wow.

1651
02:11:05,000 --> 02:11:08,000
That's a pain in the ass.

1652
02:11:16,000 --> 02:11:17,000
I guess it's not too bad.

1653
02:11:17,000 --> 02:11:20,000
I mean, yeah, it is.

1654
02:11:20,000 --> 02:11:25,000
Especially because they're still coming after you at that point, too.

1655
02:11:27,000 --> 02:11:31,000
Yeah, I wonder what the little check that to.

1656
02:11:31,000 --> 02:11:32,000
Let's go look.

1657
02:11:32,000 --> 02:11:35,000
You got the chain chumps to deal with here.

1658
02:11:35,000 --> 02:11:39,000
I'm assuming this is going to bring you right to where Baby Bowser is.

1659
02:11:39,000 --> 02:11:42,000
Where I, where you fall, not yeah.

1660
02:11:42,000 --> 02:11:45,000
That's crazy.

1661
02:11:45,000 --> 02:11:48,000
That is crazy.

1662
02:11:48,000 --> 02:11:50,000
The underwater set will arrive.

1663
02:11:50,000 --> 02:11:51,000
Okay.

1664
02:11:51,000 --> 02:11:52,000
Thanks.

1665
02:11:52,000 --> 02:11:55,000
Thanks, Nintendo.

1666
02:11:56,000 --> 02:11:58,000
Is there anything else here?

1667
02:12:03,000 --> 02:12:09,000
That's crazy how easy that is if you just get there and fall down.

1668
02:12:09,000 --> 02:12:17,000
See, in my opinion, I would, I would delete these blocks.

1669
02:12:17,000 --> 02:12:19,000
So you can't see that that's down there.

1670
02:12:19,000 --> 02:12:24,000
And I would probably even delete like these.

1671
02:12:26,000 --> 02:12:28,000
Just to make it so it's not.

1672
02:12:28,000 --> 02:12:31,000
You know, if you jump down there, you find that.

1673
02:12:31,000 --> 02:12:34,000
I mean, it's still kind of difficult to land there.

1674
02:12:34,000 --> 02:12:37,000
I don't know.

1675
02:12:41,000 --> 02:12:43,000
Still cool though.

1676
02:12:43,000 --> 02:12:44,000
Still interesting.

1677
02:12:44,000 --> 02:12:47,000
Hard jump jumping around.

1678
02:12:47,000 --> 02:12:51,000
This was not that hard, but still.

1679
02:12:51,000 --> 02:12:53,000
Very cool.

1680
02:12:55,000 --> 02:12:58,000
What is that annoying cat hand?

1681
02:13:04,000 --> 02:13:05,000
This is the featured one.

1682
02:13:05,000 --> 02:13:07,000
What else is here?

1683
02:13:07,000 --> 02:13:08,000
Look at this one.

1684
02:13:08,000 --> 02:13:11,000
What is going on in this one?

1685
02:13:11,000 --> 02:13:15,000
It's just a big long line.

1686
02:13:15,000 --> 02:13:18,000
Check it out.

1687
02:13:19,000 --> 02:13:28,000
I thought it was going to go across.

1688
02:13:28,000 --> 02:13:32,000
I have to kill everything.

1689
02:13:32,000 --> 02:13:35,000
Like that.

1690
02:13:35,000 --> 02:13:40,000
Okay.

1691
02:13:40,000 --> 02:13:55,000
I mean, I would feed the stars level.

1692
02:13:55,000 --> 02:14:03,000
Man, Ashley's level was much more complicated than that.

1693
02:14:03,000 --> 02:14:06,000
Why is that one featured?

1694
02:14:06,000 --> 02:14:09,000
It seems like somebody just made a line of goombas.

1695
02:14:09,000 --> 02:14:14,000
I was waiting for something to kind of happen, but whatever.

1696
02:14:14,000 --> 02:14:16,000
Goomba castle.

1697
02:14:16,000 --> 02:14:18,000
Coopa castle.

1698
02:14:18,000 --> 02:14:22,000
Mega castle.

1699
02:14:22,000 --> 02:14:24,000
What is going on in this one?

1700
02:14:24,000 --> 02:14:27,000
Is it gigantic gap here?

1701
02:14:27,000 --> 02:14:30,000
Let's check it out.

1702
02:14:30,000 --> 02:14:32,000
Well, 33% clear rate.

1703
02:14:32,000 --> 02:14:34,000
I'm assuming that a lot of people did what I just did.

1704
02:14:34,000 --> 02:14:36,000
And that's just like walk into the thing that hits you.

1705
02:14:36,000 --> 02:14:43,000
From the show and hit the show across the way.

1706
02:14:43,000 --> 02:14:52,000
There's that.

1707
02:14:52,000 --> 02:15:03,000
What the hell is going on here?

1708
02:15:03,000 --> 02:15:12,000
Why is bother stuck in there?

1709
02:15:12,000 --> 02:15:14,000
I'm Mega Man now.

1710
02:15:14,000 --> 02:15:19,000
Can I shoot?

1711
02:15:19,000 --> 02:15:26,000
Maybe I can.

1712
02:15:26,000 --> 02:15:33,000
Oh, this is going to do anything.

1713
02:15:33,000 --> 02:15:38,000
Okay.

1714
02:15:38,000 --> 02:15:45,000
It's one way to do it.

1715
02:15:45,000 --> 02:15:49,000
I get to be a spring.

1716
02:15:49,000 --> 02:15:53,000
Chalk this up to the things that make sense.

1717
02:15:53,000 --> 02:15:55,000
Trying just to get off the band thing.

1718
02:15:55,000 --> 02:15:59,000
And a star.

1719
02:15:59,000 --> 02:16:02,000
Okay, go through those of the star.

1720
02:16:02,000 --> 02:16:04,000
What's up with that?

1721
02:16:04,000 --> 02:16:09,000
Oh, that's why they gave me the star.

1722
02:16:09,000 --> 02:16:15,000
Okay.

1723
02:16:15,000 --> 02:16:20,000
I don't think I need to see any more of this one.

1724
02:16:20,000 --> 02:16:21,000
Maybe why not?

1725
02:16:21,000 --> 02:16:23,000
Let's try to complete it.

1726
02:16:23,000 --> 02:16:28,000
I'm going to take it.

1727
02:16:28,000 --> 02:16:31,000
Now that I know that there's no reason to do anything here.

1728
02:16:31,000 --> 02:16:32,000
I did.

1729
02:16:32,000 --> 02:16:34,000
They just hit this one.

1730
02:16:34,000 --> 02:16:37,000
Oh, God.

1731
02:16:37,000 --> 02:16:44,000
There.

1732
02:16:44,000 --> 02:16:51,000
Wee.

1733
02:16:51,000 --> 02:17:01,000
I don't think I'm going to be the spring for theirs.

1734
02:17:01,000 --> 02:17:08,000
Okay.

1735
02:17:08,000 --> 02:17:11,000
Okay.

1736
02:17:11,000 --> 02:17:19,000
Well, we're going to do another one.

1737
02:17:19,000 --> 02:17:22,000
That one was very odd.

1738
02:17:22,000 --> 02:17:26,000
I did say I was stopping like 10 minutes ago, but sometimes you just got to keep playing.

1739
02:17:26,000 --> 02:17:31,000
I'm still up, right?

1740
02:17:31,000 --> 02:17:32,000
I'm going to get big.

1741
02:17:32,000 --> 02:17:33,000
Look at this one.

1742
02:17:33,000 --> 02:17:38,000
It's long and it's complicated.

1743
02:17:38,000 --> 02:17:44,000
Start ranking.

1744
02:17:44,000 --> 02:17:48,000
I believe we've already seen this one.

1745
02:17:48,000 --> 02:17:52,000
Let's look at it again.

1746
02:17:52,000 --> 02:17:55,000
This is the one of the automatic ones where you don't do anything.

1747
02:17:55,000 --> 02:17:59,000
Yeah, we saw this one.

1748
02:17:59,000 --> 02:18:02,000
No, we didn't.

1749
02:18:02,000 --> 02:18:05,000
How many hours do you think it takes?

1750
02:18:05,000 --> 02:18:07,000
I don't know if Star if you're watching right now because you're like,

1751
02:18:07,000 --> 02:18:10,000
may, oh, there'll those be the main levels.

1752
02:18:10,000 --> 02:18:15,000
How long does something like this take to do realistically in hours?

1753
02:18:15,000 --> 02:18:20,000
More than 20?

1754
02:18:20,000 --> 02:18:24,000
More than 30?

1755
02:18:24,000 --> 02:18:26,000
This is outrageous.

1756
02:18:26,000 --> 02:18:28,000
It's completely and totally outlanded.

1757
02:18:28,000 --> 02:18:33,000
You're able to do something like this in this one.

1758
02:18:33,000 --> 02:18:35,000
Yeah, I feel like I'm looking at a motherboard.

1759
02:18:35,000 --> 02:18:42,000
It does look like a computer.

1760
02:18:48,000 --> 02:18:53,000
This hasn't stopped.

1761
02:18:54,000 --> 02:19:00,000
Less than 10 hours?

1762
02:19:00,000 --> 02:19:03,000
No, poor Yoshi.

1763
02:19:03,000 --> 02:19:07,000
Look at Yoshi's running on the treadmill so fast.

1764
02:19:07,000 --> 02:19:12,000
Somebody save him.

1765
02:19:12,000 --> 02:19:20,000
This is a lot of testing that I'm actually hard to make.

1766
02:19:20,000 --> 02:19:25,000
I would lose my place.

1767
02:19:25,000 --> 02:19:27,000
Hundreds of times.

1768
02:19:27,000 --> 02:19:32,000
I would get to a point where I made something like that and then something would go wrong in the middle.

1769
02:19:32,000 --> 02:19:37,000
And I would lose my mind and I'd just realize that that's Bowser's face.

1770
02:19:37,000 --> 02:19:40,000
That is Bowser's face, right?

1771
02:19:40,000 --> 02:19:42,000
That's a really, really cool good job.

1772
02:19:42,000 --> 02:19:43,000
Great work.

1773
02:19:43,000 --> 02:19:49,000
Is that the one we saw on the Mario Kart one?

1774
02:19:49,000 --> 02:19:54,000
Gourmet race.

1775
02:19:54,000 --> 02:20:01,000
Okay.

1776
02:20:01,000 --> 02:20:07,000
Run.

1777
02:20:07,000 --> 02:20:11,000
It's a music level, huh?

1778
02:20:11,000 --> 02:20:18,000
Fantastic.

1779
02:20:18,000 --> 02:20:25,000
Cool.

1780
02:20:25,000 --> 02:20:28,000
I could just do this.

1781
02:20:28,000 --> 02:20:32,000
Fuck playing the game and getting mad at all dying and losing over and over again.

1782
02:20:32,000 --> 02:20:43,000
I wanted to see people make music and do automatic fun levels.

1783
02:20:44,000 --> 02:20:48,000
Thousands of comments.

1784
02:20:48,000 --> 02:20:52,000
Zelda song.

1785
02:20:52,000 --> 02:20:56,000
Let's hear the Zelda song.

1786
02:20:56,000 --> 02:21:02,000
That's cool that you can actually put notes to actually have.

1787
02:21:13,000 --> 02:21:16,000
No, I don't want to end.

1788
02:21:16,000 --> 02:21:18,000
Oh, that wasn't the end.

1789
02:21:18,000 --> 02:21:19,000
Come on back.

1790
02:21:19,000 --> 02:21:23,000
Come back so I can see the rest of the song.

1791
02:21:23,000 --> 02:21:24,000
It'll come back.

1792
02:21:24,000 --> 02:21:25,000
It'll come back.

1793
02:21:25,000 --> 02:21:26,000
Don't worry.

1794
02:21:26,000 --> 02:21:27,000
I'll be freaked out.

1795
02:21:27,000 --> 02:21:28,000
Oh, okay, now let's do it in reverse.

1796
02:21:28,000 --> 02:21:35,000
Come on.

1797
02:21:35,000 --> 02:21:42,000
Yeah.

1798
02:21:42,000 --> 02:21:45,000
Start over.

1799
02:21:45,000 --> 02:21:49,000
Let's see.

1800
02:21:49,000 --> 02:21:56,000
Does anyone have like a Pac-Man song?

1801
02:21:56,000 --> 02:22:03,000
Pac-Man's in the game.

1802
02:22:03,000 --> 02:22:08,000
Smash, look at all that shit Smash Brothers theme.

1803
02:22:08,000 --> 02:22:16,000
Which one?

1804
02:22:16,000 --> 02:22:23,000
Is more?

1805
02:22:23,000 --> 02:22:45,000
How would you even be able to know that was happening?

1806
02:22:46,000 --> 02:22:51,000
There are some people out there that are just very good at things.

1807
02:22:51,000 --> 02:22:57,000
Making a level like that must just be so fun for those people to make.

1808
02:22:57,000 --> 02:22:59,000
That's so, that's so awesome.

1809
02:22:59,000 --> 02:23:05,000
I'm so glad that stuff like that exists for everyone to enjoy.

1810
02:23:05,000 --> 02:23:09,000
Nice job, Matt.

1811
02:23:09,000 --> 02:23:16,000
No wonder these like the most highest rated ones.

1812
02:23:16,000 --> 02:23:18,000
Don't touch the shrooms.

1813
02:23:18,000 --> 02:23:21,000
Did I do this one?

1814
02:23:21,000 --> 02:23:22,000
Is this the one that I did earlier?

1815
02:23:22,000 --> 02:23:23,000
Or is this a different one?

1816
02:23:23,000 --> 02:23:27,000
This one only is a 13% clear.

1817
02:23:27,000 --> 02:23:31,000
I'm not good at everybody's good at something.

1818
02:23:31,000 --> 02:23:32,000
I lost.

1819
02:23:32,000 --> 02:23:38,000
I touched the shroom.

1820
02:23:39,000 --> 02:23:47,000
Restart.

1821
02:23:47,000 --> 02:23:53,000
Holy shit.

1822
02:23:53,000 --> 02:24:02,000
Can I get hit by something?

1823
02:24:02,000 --> 02:24:08,000
Why doesn't he have a 13% clear?

1824
02:24:08,000 --> 02:24:13,000
Why doesn't he have a 13% clear?

1825
02:24:13,000 --> 02:24:16,000
I'm not good at school.

1826
02:24:16,000 --> 02:24:20,000
Whatever.

1827
02:24:20,000 --> 02:24:27,000
I'm good at school.

1828
02:24:28,000 --> 02:24:30,000
Whatever.

1829
02:24:30,000 --> 02:24:36,000
That's cool.

1830
02:24:36,000 --> 02:24:38,000
Well, you made that map?

1831
02:24:38,000 --> 02:24:40,000
I know I'm brilliant and made that map.

1832
02:24:40,000 --> 02:24:45,000
If that's true, then you did that good job.

1833
02:24:45,000 --> 02:24:48,000
We saw that at the sonic level.

1834
02:24:48,000 --> 02:24:50,000
What was up and comes?

1835
02:24:50,000 --> 02:24:55,000
Let's take a look at the up and coming list.

1836
02:24:55,000 --> 02:24:58,000
Might have to backtrack.

1837
02:24:58,000 --> 02:25:03,000
Hard.

1838
02:25:03,000 --> 02:25:06,000
Let's just take a look at it.

1839
02:25:06,000 --> 02:25:09,000
I'm going to be the first person to play this level.

1840
02:25:09,000 --> 02:25:10,000
No one else is attempted.

1841
02:25:10,000 --> 02:25:17,000
How is this an up and coming level of no one has played it?

1842
02:25:17,000 --> 02:25:20,000
How does this level has a 13% clear right?

1843
02:25:20,000 --> 02:25:21,000
Looks at it in the leaves.

1844
02:25:21,000 --> 02:25:25,000
Yeah, I'm a contributing factor that.

1845
02:25:25,000 --> 02:25:34,000
For sure.

1846
02:25:34,000 --> 02:25:37,000
Just throwing shit around for fun.

1847
02:25:37,000 --> 02:25:38,000
Walking into it.

1848
02:25:38,000 --> 02:25:45,000
You know how it is.

1849
02:25:45,000 --> 02:25:50,000
I missed.

1850
02:25:50,000 --> 02:26:05,000
Check everything.

1851
02:26:05,000 --> 02:26:10,000
Check everything.

1852
02:26:10,000 --> 02:26:11,000
Except for the top ones.

1853
02:26:11,000 --> 02:26:14,000
Don't check those.

1854
02:26:14,000 --> 02:26:15,000
Just jump on his head.

1855
02:26:15,000 --> 02:26:19,000
What am I doing?

1856
02:26:19,000 --> 02:26:23,000
I'm going to be one of those star levels where I need the bombs to explode on something.

1857
02:26:23,000 --> 02:26:28,000
I feel like it could be.

1858
02:26:28,000 --> 02:26:37,000
Got this asshole now.

1859
02:26:37,000 --> 02:26:39,000
Ooh.

1860
02:26:39,000 --> 02:26:47,000
That's one way to do it.

1861
02:26:47,000 --> 02:26:48,000
Yoshi.

1862
02:26:48,000 --> 02:26:52,000
Am I need to get him?

1863
02:26:52,000 --> 02:26:53,000
Oh.

1864
02:26:53,000 --> 02:26:59,000
Yeah.

1865
02:26:59,000 --> 02:27:02,000
I thought you could eat those.

1866
02:27:02,000 --> 02:27:06,000
I was certain you could eat those.

1867
02:27:06,000 --> 02:27:07,000
Need them.

1868
02:27:07,000 --> 02:27:09,000
Not their magic.

1869
02:27:09,000 --> 02:27:10,000
No, Yoshi.

1870
02:27:10,000 --> 02:27:11,000
Come back.

1871
02:27:11,000 --> 02:27:12,000
Uh-oh.

1872
02:27:13,000 --> 02:27:19,000
So I'm going to fall apart here.

1873
02:27:19,000 --> 02:27:27,000
They look like they could have been something down there.

1874
02:27:27,000 --> 02:27:32,000
Just checking it all out.

1875
02:27:32,000 --> 02:27:42,000
Oh.

1876
02:27:42,000 --> 02:27:59,000
What else is new?

1877
02:27:59,000 --> 02:28:02,000
Oh.

1878
02:28:02,000 --> 02:28:05,000
Give me cloud guy again.

1879
02:28:05,000 --> 02:28:08,000
I want to get that out.

1880
02:28:08,000 --> 02:28:16,000
I guess it's right here.

1881
02:28:16,000 --> 02:28:20,000
And get it.

1882
02:28:20,000 --> 02:28:28,000
Okay, Yoshi.

1883
02:28:28,000 --> 02:28:31,000
What is going on here?

1884
02:28:31,000 --> 02:28:32,000
Oh.

1885
02:28:32,000 --> 02:28:34,000
I...

1886
02:28:34,000 --> 02:28:37,000
Okay.

1887
02:28:37,000 --> 02:28:39,000
Should I have gone up and around?

1888
02:28:39,000 --> 02:28:40,000
I don't know.

1889
02:28:40,000 --> 02:28:42,000
I have no idea.

1890
02:28:42,000 --> 02:28:43,000
I leveled this guy.

1891
02:28:43,000 --> 02:28:45,000
This level was made.

1892
02:28:45,000 --> 02:28:48,000
And the dude just throws in.

1893
02:28:48,000 --> 02:28:50,000
He just threw up enemies.

1894
02:28:50,000 --> 02:28:52,000
It was like, I got this idea.

1895
02:28:52,000 --> 02:28:53,000
Oh no.

1896
02:28:53,000 --> 02:28:54,000
Here's 100.

1897
02:28:54,000 --> 02:28:55,000
Just thrown up.

1898
02:28:55,000 --> 02:28:57,000
Bows isn't shit.

1899
02:28:57,000 --> 02:28:58,000
Oh.

1900
02:28:58,000 --> 02:28:59,000
I jumped down.

1901
02:28:59,000 --> 02:29:07,000
He's not here.

1902
02:29:07,000 --> 02:29:14,000
Come on, he doesn't.

1903
02:29:14,000 --> 02:29:16,000
I

1904
02:29:35,000 --> 02:29:37,000
Know I guess you can't go

1905
02:29:38,000 --> 02:29:43,000
I think I've screwed this one up. I guess you just I just don't get in this thing

1906
02:29:43,000 --> 02:29:46,000
You can just kind of jump down you have to go down

1907
02:29:50,000 --> 02:29:56,000
I'm just gonna skip that just jump over if I have the star who cares right on why I'm still in this level

1908
02:29:57,000 --> 02:30:01,000
It's supposed to just check them out and leave I'm given a given too much time here the fuck

1909
02:30:02,000 --> 02:30:06,000
What come on now that was not fair

1910
02:30:07,000 --> 02:30:09,000
Just accidentally found a hammerball

1911
02:30:14,000 --> 02:30:23,000
Yeah, I feel like this person had to go to bed they made this level and they started and then they got like called to bed

1912
02:30:23,000 --> 02:30:25,000
They were like oh shit, I gotta finish it

Put on just spikes everywhere

1914
02:30:30,000 --> 02:30:34,000
