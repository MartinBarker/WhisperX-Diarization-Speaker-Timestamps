1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,000
Friends make sure we get you in here.

2
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:07,000
We like the game.

3
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:11,000
The rest of you guys should be in here.

4
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:12,000
I'm at starting.

5
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:13,000
We started.

6
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:14,000
It's already started.

7
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:16,000
Alright, so we got, we got about seven people.

8
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:17,000
Everything I can still join.

9
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:20,000
Yeah, people, you can still join.

10
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:23,000
So if you go to GTA free mode and you find our game, that's where we all are.

11
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:28,000
Alright, what am I going to do?

12
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:29,000
First of all, get out of that cock.

13
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:31,000
Give me that cock.

14
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:36,000
Alright, nice, nice.

15
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:39,000
Oh, jeep!

16
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:43,000
I didn't know there was going to be that like, oh my god.

17
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:46,000
Alright, everyone is like killing each other.

18
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:47,000
I was expecting like a-

19
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:48,000
Oh my god!

20
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:49,000
K-offs!

21
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:54,000
Alright, get- somebody get the car with me.

22
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:55,000
Alliance.

23
00:00:56,000 --> 00:01:02,000
Alright, I absolutely do not want to be enough.

24
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:04,000
Oh, good Bob, get in.

25
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:09,000
Oh my god, it's total chaos.

26
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:14,000
Alright, everybody in, everybody in.

27
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:19,000
Alright, let's go.

28
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:22,000
Oh my gosh.

29
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:27,000
I don't even know who this guy shoot that, but-

30
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:31,000
Oh, this French guy left.

31
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:32,000
Alright, so what is it?

32
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:33,000
Everybody versus MLC stuff?

33
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:38,000
Does that just happen right now?

34
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:42,000
Oh my god.

35
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:44,000
Hey, you guys are my assassins.

36
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:46,000
You got to take out MLC stuff.

37
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:48,000
Where do you do it?

38
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:51,000
You just glitched out of the cock.

39
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:54,000
Oh my god, everyone's like glitches.

40
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:55,000
Alright, hissing jam.

41
00:01:55,000 --> 00:02:01,000
We're gonna do a wrap around here.

42
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:02,000
Oh no.

43
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:05,000
Alright, oh, cops, cops.

44
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:08,000
Take about.

45
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:10,000
Alright, where is everybody?

46
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:13,000
Oh, this car's stalled.

47
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:17,000
He's not stalled, it just doesn't have tires.

48
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:20,000
All right, let's do something.

49
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:23,000
All right, let's do something.

50
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:26,000
All right, let's do something.

51
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:30,000
All right, you guys want to actually do something?

52
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:33,000
We should actually do something.

53
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:35,000
All right, let's do something.

54
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:37,000
A shibby wants to chat.

55
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:41,000
He's something me one of those two.

56
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:42,000
Uh oh.

57
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:44,000
We're streaming.

58
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:45,000
You can't all tap.

59
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:46,000
We can't all tap.

60
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:47,000
Oh no.

61
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:48,000
We can enter his group chat.

62
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:49,000
And then tell him we're streaming.

63
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:50,000
Hold on, let me do that.

64
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:51,000
Yeah, you just do that.

65
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:52,000
Tell him we're streaming.

66
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:53,000
Hello, shibby.

67
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:58,000
It's me and Jerma be streaming.

68
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:00,000
All right, who's behind me right now?

69
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:02,000
Who's in this car?

70
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:06,000
You guys are both.

71
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:08,000
All right, come here.

72
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:10,000
Let me get in this car.

73
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:13,000
Let me get in this baby.

74
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:15,000
I love this no door.

75
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:20,000
Let me just get in like a like it's a milk truck.

76
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:22,000
Who did he?

77
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:25,000
I love how burger boys just did an ambulance.

78
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:26,000
Or what is that?

79
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:27,000
An ambulance or a fire truck?

80
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:31,000
I don't really remember.

81
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:36,000
All right, let's take, let's go get a helicopter.

82
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:38,000
Let's go grab a helicopter.

83
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:39,000
Oh my god.

84
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:42,000
What did you do?

85
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:44,000
I'm just gonna sit here.

86
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:46,000
I don't have to go anywhere.

87
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:49,000
I could just go, oh my god.

88
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:53,000
Oh no, he's shooting at me.

89
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:55,000
Oh, that shit kills you.

90
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:58,000
No, I'm like sitting on top of a roof with my car.

91
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:01,000
Oh, that's not happening to me.

92
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:04,000
Officer, I can't believe what's happening here.

93
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:06,000
I'll be a good guy.

94
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:08,000
Hey, officer, can we have for a second?

95
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:09,000
Can I like look at your gun?

96
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:12,000
Can I just, can I...

97
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:15,000
I just saw you with my...

98
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:17,000
Oh, you're gonna bring a gun to a point.

99
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:19,000
Oh, come on.

100
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:22,000
You're gonna bring a gun.

101
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:24,000
All right, burger boy, where are you?

102
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:28,000
I want to get in your car.

103
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:31,000
Who's the pink?

104
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:32,000
Who's the pink blip?

105
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:34,000
Oh, let's just do it, all right.

106
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:36,000
He's being chased by police.

107
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:38,000
Let me get in your...

108
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:41,000
In your whip.

109
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:44,000
No!

110
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:46,000
You wanna shoot out?

111
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:47,000
That's what you got.

112
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:49,000
I'm taking your car, too.

113
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:54,000
I'm taking this thing to a dealer and I'm selling it.

114
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:55,000
Oh god, there he is.

115
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:58,000
Oh god, go, go, go, go, go, go.

116
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:00,000
All right.

117
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:03,000
I want everybody to...

118
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:05,000
MLC's to say it, it's to say it.

119
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:07,000
So everybody come to me on the map.

120
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:08,000
Where are you destroyed right now?

121
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:10,000
Everybody come to me on the map.

122
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:11,000
My car doesn't have any doors on it.

123
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:14,000
Look at my car.

124
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:16,000
Nobody killed each other.

125
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:19,000
Everybody come to, to, to win me an MLC stealth out right now.

126
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:22,000
The brown blip and the, what color am I?

127
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:24,000
I'm orange, I think?

128
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:26,000
This cop wants me dead.

129
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:27,000
I'm gonna let him kill me.

130
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:32,000
So if you guys come to the blip, I want to, I want to try something.

131
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:36,000
Let's see if we can make something weird happen right now.

132
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:37,000
Will you just kill me already?

133
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:39,000
Is that cop shooting at me?

134
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:40,000
Oh he is.

135
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:41,000
What?

136
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:43,000
Did he just kill me?

137
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:46,000
Did you just back into me or did that cop shoot me in the face?

138
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:47,000
He shot you in the face.

139
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:48,000
All right, you know what?

140
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:49,000
It's my list.

141
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:50,000
Screw this.

142
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:52,000
Oh no, it's my statue.

143
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:54,000
What's it look like?

144
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:56,000
I like a bow.

145
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:57,000
What the?

146
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:58,000
All right, follow me.

147
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:00,000
We're gonna, we're gonna, we're gonna get a helicopter.

148
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:01,000
Punch me in the face?

149
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:02,000
I did, but I was accidental.

150
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:03,000
I didn't meet him.

151
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:05,000
All right, let's go, we're gonna get a helicopter.

152
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:06,000
Hold on.

153
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:08,000
We can all these like people is fun.

154
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:10,000
Look at this wall going on right here.

155
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:11,000
Where is Bergeboy in all this?

156
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:12,000
Let's go get a helicopter.

157
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:13,000
Oh my.

158
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:18,000
These cops are doing a horrible job at regulating the laws.

159
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:19,000
Oh god, we got a spawn.

160
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:20,000
We got a spawner.

161
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:21,000
Don't kill us.

162
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:22,000
Yep.

163
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:23,000
Oh yeah, all right, he's not gonna kill us.

164
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:24,000
All right, come with us.

165
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:26,000
I get so afraid whenever I see a person in front of us.

166
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:28,000
Please don't shoot us.

167
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:30,000
Put your parachute on, everyone.

168
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:32,000
Yeah, make sure you get your parachute on.

169
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:33,000
I love all this.

170
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:36,000
There is something going on, like a hundred feet away from us.

171
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:38,000
People are just slaughtering each other.

172
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:40,000
And I feel like it has something to do with Bergeboy.

173
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:42,000
We need a car.

174
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:44,000
Wait, we're all just running with people.

175
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:46,000
Oh, oh, oh, oh.

176
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:48,000
Oh, hey, got, oh, get in this thing.

177
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:50,000
It's only has two seats, I think.

178
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:51,000
That's all right though.

179
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:52,000
Oh my gosh, what's happening?

180
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:53,000
What's happening?

181
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:54,000
Crazy lady.

182
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:57,000
This guy's out of his mind.

183
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:58,000
I'm out of here.

184
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:00,000
That guy's out of his mind.

185
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:02,000
That guy's out of his mind.

186
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:04,000
That guy's out of his mind.

187
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:06,000
That guy's out of his mind.

188
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:08,000
That guy hissing is like just killing people left and right.

189
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:09,000
I'm running away.

190
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:10,000
Oh, an hour's in.

191
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:11,000
Or not seen.

192
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:14,000
I just started like putting out everybody that was in a driver's seat

193
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:16,000
in a car that was next to us.

194
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:18,000
I'm going to get a helicopter.

195
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:20,000
This is, oh my god, this thing handles like-

196
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:21,000
Where are you driving?

197
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:22,000
I...

198
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:24,000
I have it on my GPS.

199
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:25,000
I'm really drunk.

200
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:27,000
I just bought my GPS.

201
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:29,000
From Walgreens.

202
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:32,000
I have coughs on me?

203
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:33,000
No, I don't.

204
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:34,000
I guess I do.

205
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:35,000
All right.

206
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:39,000
Look at this.

207
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:40,000
Look at these people just killing each other.

208
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:43,000
I'm going to get a helicopter and then it's going to be game over.

209
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:46,000
Get them going way too fast.

210
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:48,000
This always ends very badly.

211
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:50,000
Anytime I go this fast, it's never ends well.

212
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:51,000
Ever.

213
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:53,000
You never like finding like a nice safe jump to go off of.

214
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:54,000
Oh, here we go.

215
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:55,000
Add a control.

216
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:56,000
Here we add a control.

217
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:01,000
Why don't I do that?

218
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:02,000
There was no reason to do that.

219
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:04,000
I'm okay.

220
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:06,000
The coughs are still behind me.

221
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:10,000
Did I feel like I was just on a bike?

222
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:12,000
All right.

223
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:14,000
I'm going to add this guy so we can get him.

224
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:16,000
Jacob Watson.

225
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:17,000
Absolutely.

226
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:19,000
Come on in, man.

227
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:20,000
Come on in the game.

228
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:22,000
Oh, my god.

229
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:23,000
Oh, my god.

230
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:24,000
No.

231
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:25,000
Get away from me.

232
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:26,000
Oh.

233
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:31,000
Oh, Jacob's in, is he?

234
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:35,000
I believe.

235
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:39,000
Wait, what is singing right now?

236
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:42,000
What is singing?

237
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:48,000
Wait, what is that?

238
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:52,000
How come the people talking?

239
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:54,000
Oh, my gosh.

240
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:55,000
All right, let's go.

241
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:56,000
Go.

242
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:57,000
Go.

243
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:58,000
Oh, but I'll throw a bug.

244
00:08:58,000 --> 00:08:59,000
I'll throw a bug.

245
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:00,000
Get in.

246
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:01,000
Quick.

247
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:02,000
All right.

248
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:03,000
We're going to get a helicopter.

249
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:05,000
Is it off this cliff right here?

250
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:06,000
Oh, you.

251
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:07,000
Okay.

252
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:08,000
All right.

253
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:09,000
Go.

254
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:10,000
I'll be the navigator.

255
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:11,000
Go straight.

256
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:13,000
Don't straight until you can't go straight anymore.

257
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:17,000
Burger boy, I love how you were in a ambulance.

258
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:19,000
Just like driving a hundred miles per hour.

259
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:23,000
One of our tires is blown and it's going to end very poorly.

260
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:27,000
All right, don't like driving into a cliff.

261
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:29,000
Oh, there we go.

262
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:33,000
Why did you get out?

263
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:35,000
It's so far away.

264
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:36,000
All right, so still.

265
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:38,000
We already had the, at the count of three.

266
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:39,000
I know where we're going.

267
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:41,000
We're going to, well, you know what we're going.

268
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:44,000
You take this like the, what just happened?

269
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:46,000
I love how I'm in the back.

270
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:49,000
I'm your chauffeur.

271
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:51,000
All right, just, I'm getting out.

272
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:52,000
I'm getting out.

273
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:53,000
I don't trust you.

274
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:54,000
I don't trust you.

275
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:55,000
No, no, get in.

276
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:57,000
I'm sorry, you just going to drive off the edge.

277
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:59,000
I don't know.

278
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:00,000
All right, okay.

279
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:01,000
All right, okay.

280
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:02,000
Go.

281
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:04,000
Do you proceed to highlight the roof?

282
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:06,000
I don't even have like my headphones plugged in.

283
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:08,000
You guys are probably like, oh, what?

284
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:09,000
What?

285
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:10,000
Oh, my god.

286
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:11,000
Oh, my god.

287
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:12,000
It's hissing, Jim.

288
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:13,000
Get him.

289
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:14,000
Get him.

290
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:15,000
What an intense shootout this is.

291
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:18,000
Oh, I got fire on when I was a kid.

292
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:21,000
There's rats from the Gary Shiwka, Jellars and hoods.

293
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:22,000
So, it's反y.

294
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:23,000
You guys, scared of me.

295
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:25,000
I probably like vaccines.

296
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:28,000
It's all heroes.

297
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:29,000
The sustenance shootout is safe.

298
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:33,000
A lot of hard-hit abuse events took so long to accomplish

299
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:34,000
the issue without assault.

300
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:35,000
If the judge is cruel,

301
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:37,000
their brain and their soldiers'呃,

302
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:38,000
grenades are coming on.

303
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:42,000
Oh, I'd really like to have the game because they don't kill

304
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:42,000
you.

305
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:43,000
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

306
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:45,000
about it every night and day

307
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:48,000
I swear my way is in front of my way

308
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:50,000
I buried back in the soul

309
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:54,000
I see you running through the open door

310
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:57,000
Oh God, did I crash?

311
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:59,000
Oh no I crashed!

312
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:01,000
No I didn't, no I didn't, I'm good I'm here

313
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:03,000
I thought I crashed, but I'm good

314
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:06,000
Oh I gotta get my headphones out

315
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:09,000
Alright, we're good to go

316
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:11,000
We're good to go

317
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:14,000
So everyone's in the airport

318
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:17,000
Now it's pretty much just a race to who gets the helicopters

319
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:24,000
I'm sorry, I'm sorry

320
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:25,000
Nope

321
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:27,000
Dodge, jump and dodge

322
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:29,000
Oh give me this P90

323
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:32,000
Oh man, it is a bad sad day for anybody

324
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:34,000
Cup and Closet to be

325
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:39,000
Alright, I'm safe

326
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:44,000
I need to get, you know what? I gotta get a car

327
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:46,000
I gotta get a cup

328
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:48,000
Hey, how you doing?

329
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:51,000
Please don't kill me, okay, he ran by me good

330
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:55,000
Hey, this guy's idea of fun is getting inside the helicopter

331
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:58,000
and shooting all the other helicopters so nobody else can get in

332
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:00,000
Oh he's a piece of crap

333
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:04,000
Alright, Operation Takeout the guy in the helicopter

334
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:09,000
Operation Takeout helicopter flyer

335
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:12,000
Find rocket launcher and dispose of

336
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:14,000
I got in the helicopter, I was gonna

337
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:19,000
Alright, I'm gonna get over there, I'm on my way

338
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:21,000
I'm in route

339
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:24,000
Break that window

340
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:28,000
Oh this brings back memories and I smashed my face on that guy

341
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:32,000
He's not even moving, what is that guy doing?

342
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:35,000
Wait, where am I going?

343
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:39,000
The helicopter's right there, they're right there, okay

344
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:43,000
It's a good tactic man, that's alright

345
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:47,000
Alright, who thinks I'm gonna make it underneath this plane?

346
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:49,000
I do

347
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:56,000
Give me a helicopter

348
00:12:57,000 --> 00:13:03,000
Please don't die, I'm so addicted to oh my god

349
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:08,000
Oh my god, oh my god

350
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:10,000
Oh my god

351
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:14,000
I need to crouch, how do I crouch?

352
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:17,000
Oh my god, what a psycho

353
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:19,000
What a psycho

354
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:23,000
What are you doing?

355
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:27,000
My helicopter, what is happening to you?

356
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:32,000
Why can't it stay flying?

357
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:35,000
Are you having a helicopter or are you driving?

358
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:38,000
Hey dude, stop crouching run

359
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:42,000
All these helicopters are destroyed

360
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:45,000
Oh dear god, this is bad

361
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:49,000
This is so bad, I'm gonna die the second I get into this

362
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:51,000
Oh, run away

363
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:53,000
I'm not even gonna go in that dude, I'm gonna die

364
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:55,000
The second I get into this

365
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:57,000
Oh my god

366
00:13:57,000 --> 00:14:01,000
It's my chance, it's my chance, get in

367
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:07,000
Get in, get in, go, go you slug

00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:13,000
Oh yeah, it's time for a helicopter wars

369
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:19,000
Oh my god, no, no, no

370

Get up, oh that was, I just really had a hot attack

371
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:29,000
The helicopter sucks, it being a helicopter

372
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:31,000
I'm alright

373
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:37,000
Yeah, what's going on, I feel like I'm driving a, alright let me name it down to the ground

374
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:41,000
Any unsuspecting people I can smash into?

375
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:47,000
Alright, this cop's down there, forage, unleash the fury

376
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:53,000
Not killing anybody, you know what, I'm going kamikaze

377
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:57,000
Oh my god, whoever this pink dot is

378
00:14:57,000 --> 00:15:01,000
Did you pick the bad day to be a pink dot?

379
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:07,000
You picked a bad day to be a pink, oh I'm gonna throw up dude, really

380
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:09,000
I'm really kinda puke

381
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:13,000
Did like the controls change or is this lag

382
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:15,000
Oh wow

383
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:17,000
How did I work flying?

384
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:27,000
Well, that's how we get out of a helicopter and walk off the front and

385
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:31,000
Hey, come pick me up

386
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:37,000
Where I, oh my god, I think Papa got a brand new bag here

387
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:45,000
No!

388
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:49,000
I'm such a bad shot

389
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:55,000
I was like landing, oh you were trying to pick me up

390
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:59,000
Oh I'm sorry, I thought you were like you shooting missiles at me, I was scared

391
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:03,000
Because you shot a rocket at me

392
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:07,000
I'm conserving the rest of this stuff

393
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:11,000
Let's get out of here, we're like being shot at to death

394
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:15,000
I'm gonna be so angry

395
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:19,000
I got my gun and I'm just spawning and pulling out pistols and just shooting each other

396
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:23,000
This is so like un-fucking-hide

397
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:27,000
I'm gonna kill this guy

398
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:31,000
Get him, get him, oh I could have sworn

399
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:39,000
Do I blame Tom Brady or anybody for a Westwalker?

400
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:43,000
No, I mean the preachers didn't really have that

401
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:47,000
It was a pretty much string of luck that they got into the playoffs to begin with

402
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:51,000
So, good to see him get that far, but yeah go Celtics

403
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:55,000
That's all I got to say

404
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:59,000
Alright, where's Berger Boy? Berger Boy is the number one target for me right now

405
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:03,000
I think he is, no, you're brown, you're brown

406
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:05,000
He's green

407
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:07,000
They're orange

408
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:11,000
Alright, so stream Berger Boy is target number one

409
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:15,000
Look at how mad he is

410
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:17,000
I want the whole street

411
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:19,000
We can make him rage quit

412
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:21,000
You guys suck

413
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:27,000
For some reason I want to save Kordo Bomb

414
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:29,000
Get in, get in Berger Boy

415
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:31,000
We're making it out of here alive

416
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:35,000
Get in Kordo Bomb

417
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:37,000
Get in Berger Boy, I don't want to escape

418
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:39,000
I actually, you know Berger Boy

419
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:45,000
Oh no, oh no, oh I got the P&I D-Man

420
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:47,000
How was he, I just unloaded

421
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:49,000
70 bullets into that guy

422
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:51,000
What a champion

423
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:53,000
So are we still having a war against Berger Boy?

424
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:55,000
I'm trying to get an helicopter

425
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:57,000
I'll save you, I mean you guys

426
00:17:57,000 --> 00:17:59,000
Oh, excuse my...

427
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:01,000
Oh my god

428
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:03,000
Stay with it

429
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:05,000
What was that?

430
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:07,000
What on earth was that?

431
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:09,000
That was ridiculous, was that a rocket?

432
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:11,000
Holy crap

433
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:13,000
Oh

434
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:17,000
No, I want to live

435
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:19,000
I want to live, get me all like the

441
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:37,000

443
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:41,000
Where'd you go?

444
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:43,000

00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:01,000
You can't, you can't get in

454
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:03,000
I'm trying to hit my head on the blades

455
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:05,000
Okay, let me just get in this helicopter

I'm getting out of this

461
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:19,000
What the fuck

462
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:21,000
Berger Boy, it's gonna blow up

463
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:23,000
That's gonna blow up

464
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:25,000
What are you doing still driving?

465
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:27,000
He jumped out

466
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:33,000
RPG, watch out

467
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:45,000

00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:47,000
That was so perfect

469
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:49,000
Oh my god, thank god

This is being recorded

471
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:55,000
Because if I didn't get that on tape

472
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:57,000
I would have been so bad at myself

473
00:19:57,000 --> 00:19:59,000
I wonder how destroyed he's just got

474
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:07,000
He's like trying so hard to stay alive

475
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:09,000

00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:07,000
Appreciate it, alright get it, hurry up, hurry up, hurry up

549
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:11,000
Oh my god, they're unloading on us

550
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:13,000
Jeez

551
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:17,000
I love how this is just a race

552
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:21,000
It's all this is just who can get the helicopter

553
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:23,000
What is that cop doing?

554
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:25,000
Freak

555
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:27,000
He's a bad guy

556
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:29,000
Oh man, look at this chaos

557
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:31,000
We got a fight going on over here boys

558
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:33,000
You got an RPG doesn't he?

559
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:35,000
Yeah

560
00:23:35,000 --> 00:23:37,000
Alright, I'm getting out of there now

561
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:39,000
Oh wait, burger boy you're dead?

562
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:41,000
I'm like sitting in the car with you, who gives you?

563
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:43,000
Alright, we

564
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:47,000
We're at the airfield waiting for a spawn

565
00:23:47,000 --> 00:23:49,000
Come on, come on, spawn a copter

566
00:23:49,000 --> 00:23:51,000
They're on the air, aren't they?

567
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:53,000
Oh man

568
00:23:53,000 --> 00:23:55,000
I never really liked shooting

569
00:23:55,000 --> 00:23:57,000
Nobody just wants to run cars into each other

570
00:23:57,000 --> 00:24:01,000
Where's these helicopters?

571
00:24:01,000 --> 00:24:05,000
I'm taking cover behind, I know someone's gonna come and just smash into us

572
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:07,000
Oh yeah, take the cover

573
00:24:07,000 --> 00:24:09,000
I'm stuck on the door right now

574
00:24:09,000 --> 00:24:11,000
Oh man, oh man, oh man, oh man

575
00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:13,000
Oh no, no, no

576
00:24:13,000 --> 00:24:17,000
Alright, at least I, that would have died from that explosion

577
00:24:17,000 --> 00:24:19,000
If I didn't die from that explosion

578
00:24:19,000 --> 00:24:21,000
I would have died from that explosion

579
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:23,000
I would have died from that explosion

580
00:24:23,000 --> 00:24:25,000
Alright, at least I, that would have died from that explosion

581
00:24:25,000 --> 00:24:27,000
If I didn't die from that explosion

582
00:24:27,000 --> 00:24:29,000
I would have died from the

583
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:31,000
You know what, I'm going this way

584
00:24:31,000 --> 00:24:33,000
Oh, there's police helicopters

585
00:24:33,000 --> 00:24:35,000
I got a plan, you know, I have a plan

586
00:24:35,000 --> 00:24:37,000
And it's gonna work

587
00:24:37,000 --> 00:24:39,000
Oh, it is absolutely gonna work

588
00:24:39,000 --> 00:24:41,000
Maybe it won't, probably not

589
00:24:43,000 --> 00:24:45,000
Run, run, run, run, run, run, I'll take the cop, huh?

590
00:24:47,000 --> 00:24:49,000
I'll take the cop, huh

591
00:24:49,000 --> 00:24:51,000
For those of you asking in the stream, this is episodes from Liberty City

And if you want to join, did you just see that helicopter crash?

595
00:24:59,000 --> 00:25:03,000
That was, who is in this helicopter?

596
00:25:03,000 --> 00:25:05,000
Is it a real question?

597
00:25:05,000 --> 00:25:09,000

And just join the game I'm in

600
00:25:13,000 --> 00:25:15,000
Once you've done a final question

601
00:25:15,000 --> 00:25:17,000
You should be able to

602
00:25:17,000 --> 00:25:21,000
I'll see PD

603
00:25:21,000 --> 00:25:23,000
Oh my goodness

604
00:25:23,000 --> 00:25:25,000
That is a missile coming at us

605
00:25:25,000 --> 00:25:27,000
I'm getting out

606
00:25:27,000 --> 00:25:31,000
Of course I have three stars, fantastic

607
00:25:33,000 --> 00:25:35,000
Alright, let's set up shop here

608
00:25:35,000 --> 00:25:37,000
I'm gonna add Zeus

609
00:25:37,000 --> 00:25:39,000
Where are you Zeus?

610
00:25:39,000 --> 00:25:41,000
Oh, not the back

611
00:25:41,000 --> 00:25:43,000
Oh my god

612
00:25:43,000 --> 00:25:45,000
I haven't...

613
00:25:45,000 --> 00:25:49,000
I'm in the middle of like inviting somebody to the game

614
00:25:49,000 --> 00:25:51,000
And I just hear a crash and you're next to me

615
00:25:51,000 --> 00:25:57,000
And it bites a game

616
00:25:57,000 --> 00:25:59,000
Alright

617
00:25:59,000 --> 00:26:01,000
Okay

618
00:26:01,000 --> 00:26:03,000
What am I doing?

619
00:26:03,000 --> 00:26:05,000
I'm just like creeping

620
00:26:05,000 --> 00:26:09,000
Now I'm waiting for a helicopter

621
00:26:09,000 --> 00:26:11,000
I'm waiting for a helicopter

622
00:26:11,000 --> 00:26:13,000
God, there's no way I'm gonna get it

623
00:26:13,000 --> 00:26:15,000
Oh my god

624
00:26:15,000 --> 00:26:17,000
Alright, I'm getting in

625
00:26:17,000 --> 00:26:19,000
Look at all these people

626
00:26:19,000 --> 00:26:21,000
Everywhere, I'm gonna do Plan B

627
00:26:21,000 --> 00:26:23,000
Look at the mini map

628
00:26:23,000 --> 00:26:25,000
Look at how many police are here

629
00:26:25,000 --> 00:26:27,000
Look at the mini map

630
00:26:27,000 --> 00:26:29,000
Oh, I just barely...

631
00:26:29,000 --> 00:26:33,000
I just barely almost got in there

632
00:26:33,000 --> 00:26:35,000
Alright, new plan, I'm doing Plan B

633
00:26:35,000 --> 00:26:37,000
I am absolutely...

634
00:26:37,000 --> 00:26:39,000
Well, plan B

635
00:26:39,000 --> 00:26:41,000
Plan B

636
00:26:41,000 --> 00:26:43,000
Is to go get the helicopter

637
00:26:43,000 --> 00:26:45,000
That looks...oh, here comes the SWAT team

638
00:26:45,000 --> 00:26:47,000
Good thing they're not coming after me

639
00:26:47,000 --> 00:26:49,000
How tall

640
00:26:49,000 --> 00:26:51,000
Somebody's already doing Plan B

641
00:26:51,000 --> 00:26:53,000
Somebody's already doing Plan B

642
00:26:53,000 --> 00:26:55,000
What did he say it was?

643
00:26:55,000 --> 00:26:57,000
To go base jump

644
00:26:57,000 --> 00:26:59,000
And go float over here

645
00:26:59,000 --> 00:27:01,000
Who is this?

646
00:27:01,000 --> 00:27:03,000
Is nobody even in here?

647
00:27:03,000 --> 00:27:05,000
I'm taking this

648
00:27:05,000 --> 00:27:07,000
Give me that, give it to me

649
00:27:07,000 --> 00:27:09,000
Get out of there

650
00:27:09,000 --> 00:27:11,000
Oh man, that was bad, I'm sorry Mr. Amulet's driver

651
00:27:11,000 --> 00:27:13,000
You just try to help people

652
00:27:13,000 --> 00:27:15,000
I'm such a bad person, I'm sorry

653
00:27:17,000 --> 00:27:19,000
Wooo

654
00:27:19,000 --> 00:27:21,000
Alright, turn that off

655
00:27:21,000 --> 00:27:23,000
Let's get an annoying

656
00:27:23,000 --> 00:27:25,000
Alright, let's see

657
00:27:25,000 --> 00:27:27,000
I need to go right here

658
00:27:27,000 --> 00:27:29,000
Why am I flipped over?

659
00:27:29,000 --> 00:27:31,000
I just ran to you

660
00:27:31,000 --> 00:27:33,000
You're on fire! Oh my god, you're on fire

661
00:27:33,000 --> 00:27:35,000
You're on fire, you're on fire

662
00:27:35,000 --> 00:27:37,000
No! Get away from that cop

663
00:27:37,000 --> 00:27:39,000
Give me this one

664
00:27:39,000 --> 00:27:41,000
No!

665
00:27:41,000 --> 00:27:43,000
Give me this, give me this, give me this, don't drive away

666
00:27:43,000 --> 00:27:45,000
Did I get him?

667
00:27:45,000 --> 00:27:47,000
No, I didn't

668
00:27:47,000 --> 00:27:49,000
Come here

669
00:27:49,000 --> 00:27:51,000
Come here

670
00:27:51,000 --> 00:27:53,000
Let's see his lagging

671
00:27:53,000 --> 00:27:55,000
I got him away

672
00:27:55,000 --> 00:27:57,000
Alright, let's see if the plan goes

673
00:27:57,000 --> 00:27:59,000
Let's see if the plan goes

674
00:27:59,000 --> 00:28:01,000
Oh, alright, come here

675
00:28:01,000 --> 00:28:05,000
I wasn't gonna run into it, I promise

676
00:28:05,000 --> 00:28:07,000
Right, I'm in the back seat

677
00:28:07,000 --> 00:28:11,000
Alright, driving Miss Daisy, driving Miss Stealth

678
00:28:11,000 --> 00:28:13,000
Alright, hopefully this building is tall enough

679
00:28:13,000 --> 00:28:15,000
So we can like base jump off of it

680
00:28:15,000 --> 00:28:17,000
And fly into the action

681
00:28:17,000 --> 00:28:21,000
That's a right hand

682
00:28:21,000 --> 00:28:23,000
Oh, please

683
00:28:23,000 --> 00:28:25,000
Please exit the vehicle and watch your hands and feet

684
00:28:25,000 --> 00:28:27,000
Thank you for riding in German

685
00:28:27,000 --> 00:28:29,000
The worst car driver in the world

686
00:28:29,000 --> 00:28:31,000
Thank you so much

687
00:28:31,000 --> 00:28:33,000
No, don't shoot me

688
00:28:33,000 --> 00:28:35,000
Oh, you're gonna blow it up, I see

689
00:28:35,000 --> 00:28:37,000
No, I'm shooting all the times

690
00:28:37,000 --> 00:28:39,000
Who would have dealt like this will be on YouTube

691
00:28:39,000 --> 00:28:41,000
It will

692
00:28:41,000 --> 00:28:43,000
The whole thing will be on YouTube

693
00:28:43,000 --> 00:28:45,000
Probably tomorrow

694
00:28:45,000 --> 00:28:47,000
Alright, we're gonna get a new car

695
00:28:47,000 --> 00:28:49,000
We need a new car

696
00:28:51,000 --> 00:28:53,000
Oh, somebody's already doing the parachute

697
00:28:53,000 --> 00:28:55,000
Where are the cars?

698
00:28:55,000 --> 00:28:57,000
I found a motorcycle

699
00:28:57,000 --> 00:28:59,000
Oh, geez

700
00:29:01,000 --> 00:29:02,000
Is this the guy?

701
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:04,000
Why is he, oh, get this guy

702
00:29:04,000 --> 00:29:06,000
Shoot him, shoot this guy

703
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:08,000
Shoot him

704
00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:10,000
Kill him

705
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:12,000
Kill him, kill him

706
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:16,000
Alright, I got a cop

707
00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:18,000
Where am I going?

708
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:20,000
Alright, I'm right there, I'm right here

709
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:24,000
Oh, he's the guy that was shooting us

710
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:26,000
Let's back into him

711
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:30,000
Oh, I will run you over as many times as I have to

712
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:32,000
Oh, there's many times as I have to

713
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:34,000
Oh, geez

714
00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:40,000
Alright, let's get that out of here

715
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:42,000
I'm going to do that base job

716
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:44,000
It's gonna happen

717
00:29:46,000 --> 00:29:48,000
Try the corner

718
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:50,000
Here we go

719
00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:52,000
Oh, this is a really small building

720
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:54,000
Is there a taxi I can call?

721
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:56,000
Actually, that's not that small

722
00:29:56,000 --> 00:29:58,000
I don't think we have taxes on multi-point

723
00:29:58,000 --> 00:30:00,000
Oh, dude

724
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:02,000
Hurry, hurry, hurry

725
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:04,000
Alright, so how high up am I?

726
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:06,000
Actually, it is pretty damn high

727
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:10,000
Alright, where's the action going on?

728
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:12,000
Open here

729
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:14,000
So I got to jump off this side

730
00:30:14,000 --> 00:30:16,000
And let's go

731
00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:18,000
Open, open

732
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:22,000
Alright, let's see if I can like

733
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:24,000
float into the madness

734
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:26,000
That guy's a helicopter

735
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:28,000
Floating on the helicopter, boy

736
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:30,000
That will be pretty easy

737
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:34,000
Ah, look at how relaxing this is

738
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:36,000
Just floating around

739
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:38,000
Relaxing with my friends

740
00:30:38,000 --> 00:30:40,000
Oh, hey, stealth

741
00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:42,000
I made it

742
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:44,000
That was fun

743
00:30:44,000 --> 00:30:46,000
Let's go do that again

744
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:48,000
Except, let's try it

745
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:50,000
I want to get on this

746
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:52,000
I want to get on the bike

747
00:30:52,000 --> 00:30:54,000
I want to get on the bike

748
00:30:54,000 --> 00:30:56,000
I'm trying to

749
00:30:56,000 --> 00:30:58,000
I can't just float

750
00:30:58,000 --> 00:31:00,000
What?

751
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:02,000
He's right next to me

752
00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:04,000
Oh, my god

753
00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:08,000
He was still in the riding position

754
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:10,000
He jumped up and he was like

755
00:31:10,000 --> 00:31:12,000
Oh, nothing's going on here

756
00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:14,000
I'm just like still riding the bike

757
00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:16,000
What the hell is that

758
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:20,000
Oh, I love how many glitches are in this game

759
00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:24,000
Oh, jeez

760
00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:26,000
Oh, my god, I can't control it

761
00:31:26,000 --> 00:31:28,000
Oh, it wants to play baseball

762
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:30,000
We got enough people to play baseball

763
00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:32,000
We got like, yeah, there's enough people in here

764
00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:34,000
Alright, I'm going to be the pitcher

765
00:31:34,000 --> 00:31:36,000
I'll be the batter

766
00:31:36,000 --> 00:31:38,000
Let's play grenade baseball

767
00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:40,000
Do we have any grenades?

768
00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:42,000
I'm the batter

769
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:44,000
Alright, ready?

770
00:31:44,000 --> 00:31:46,000
So I'm going to throw the ball

771
00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:48,000
Alright, ready?

772
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:50,000
So I'm going to throw the ball

773
00:31:50,000 --> 00:31:52,000
Alright, he did it

774
00:31:52,000 --> 00:31:54,000
Oh, look at the wall

775
00:31:54,000 --> 00:31:56,000
It went so far, looking so far

776
00:31:56,000 --> 00:31:58,000
Around first pass, go to second

777
00:31:58,000 --> 00:32:00,000
Oh, no, I got to throw about

778
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:02,000
Oh, I didn't get him

779
00:32:02,000 --> 00:32:04,000
Oh, no, the ball got thrown in

780
00:32:04,000 --> 00:32:06,000
Oh, he's still safe

781
00:32:06,000 --> 00:32:08,000
Here you are, you got a triple

782
00:32:08,000 --> 00:32:10,000
You got a triple

783
00:32:10,000 --> 00:32:12,000
Alright, go to the good man on third

784
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:14,000
Oh, okay, go wait, no, no, no, no

785
00:32:14,000 --> 00:32:16,000
I need to leave the car

786
00:32:16,000 --> 00:32:18,000
Oh, but it's a ghost man

787
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:20,000
Yeah, then you have to get in the car

788
00:32:20,000 --> 00:32:22,000
And drive to home plate

789
00:32:22,000 --> 00:32:24,000
So you get over there

790
00:32:26,000 --> 00:32:28,000
So you get over

791
00:32:28,000 --> 00:32:30,000
Oh, someone in the stream just right

792
00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:32,000
The crowd goes wild

793
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:34,000
Alright, so here we go, ready?

794
00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:36,000
Yeah, I pitched it

795
00:32:36,000 --> 00:32:38,000
Alright, now go run to first place

796
00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:40,000
Oh, missed

797
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:42,000
Oh, god, there's another guy here

798
00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:44,000
We're playing baseball, dude

799
00:32:44,000 --> 00:32:46,000
Oh, it's Zeus

800
00:32:46,000 --> 00:32:48,000
Oh, yeah, we'll play in baseball

801
00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:50,000
Do you want to play baseball?

802
00:32:50,000 --> 00:32:52,000
My running got home, I got a single

803
00:32:52,000 --> 00:32:54,000
Zeus, you're up

804
00:32:54,000 --> 00:32:58,000
Alright, baseball is over

805
00:32:58,000 --> 00:33:00,000
I win because you didn't get home

806
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:04,000
What's my, what do I win?

807
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:06,000
I just shot you in the toe

808
00:33:06,000 --> 00:33:08,000
Alright, run home

809
00:33:08,000 --> 00:33:10,000
Do you have a real home?

810
00:33:10,000 --> 00:33:14,000
What, what, what, I like, he's got a bad news bears joke

811
00:33:14,000 --> 00:33:22,000
Alright, hey

812
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:26,000
Oh, it's getting the tanker

813
00:33:26,000 --> 00:33:28,000
Please tell me those explode

814
00:33:28,000 --> 00:33:30,000
Please tell me those, please tell me

815
00:33:30,000 --> 00:33:32,000
No, no, no, don't shoot it, don't shoot it

816
00:33:32,000 --> 00:33:34,000
Is it connected?

817
00:33:34,000 --> 00:33:36,000
No, it's not connected

818
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:38,000
I don't think we can tonight, so this is an GTA sananjury

819
00:33:38,000 --> 00:33:40,000
They definitely explode, though, for sure

820
00:33:40,000 --> 00:33:44,000
Oh, let's see if I can connect them

821
00:33:44,000 --> 00:33:46,000
No, you can't connect them

822
00:33:46,000 --> 00:33:48,000
This is going to be a massive, you're going to die

823
00:33:48,000 --> 00:33:50,000
You're going to die in like two seconds

824
00:33:50,000 --> 00:33:52,000
The fighters are gone

825
00:33:52,000 --> 00:34:01,000
Oh my god, look at

826
00:34:01,000 --> 00:34:03,000
Look at this burger boy to save the day

827
00:34:03,000 --> 00:34:07,000
He did, wow, what a prof, let me get in

828
00:34:07,000 --> 00:34:13,000
He just flipped

829
00:34:13,000 --> 00:34:17,000
Alright, burger boy, go as high as you can

830
00:34:17,000 --> 00:34:23,000
Dude, he just flipped that car

831
00:34:23,000 --> 00:34:27,000
That's like a five million pound car

832
00:34:27,000 --> 00:34:29,000
He just flipped it over

833
00:34:29,000 --> 00:34:33,000
I still have my parachute, right? I hope so

834
00:34:37,000 --> 00:34:41,000
I love how you just came out of nowhere burger boy, that was like amazing

835
00:34:41,000 --> 00:34:49,000
I can't believe that thing flipped my tanker

836
00:34:49,000 --> 00:34:51,000
That's why I left so hot

837
00:34:51,000 --> 00:34:55,000
Oh, burger boy, you're going to waste all your ramble

838
00:34:55,000 --> 00:34:57,000
Alright, ready? Here we go

839
00:34:57,000 --> 00:35:01,000
I am going to jump out of the, I'm going to parachute

840
00:35:01,000 --> 00:35:03,000
I'm going to parachute and see how long I can parachute for

841
00:35:03,000 --> 00:35:05,000
So keep going up

842
00:35:05,000 --> 00:35:11,000
Shoot, oh shoot all the pre-fall down there

843
00:35:11,000 --> 00:35:13,000
Wow, we are up really high

844
00:35:13,000 --> 00:35:15,000
I think this is as high as we can go

845
00:35:15,000 --> 00:35:17,000
Thanks burger boy, woohoo

846
00:35:17,000 --> 00:35:19,000
Oh yeah

847
00:35:19,000 --> 00:35:23,000
Thanks burger boy, I'm going to watch and see where burger boy goes

848
00:35:23,000 --> 00:35:29,000
So I'll tell you a story while I'm parachute

849
00:35:29,000 --> 00:35:31,000
It's like story time

850
00:35:31,000 --> 00:35:33,000
So one time, let's see how long it takes before I can finish this story

851
00:35:33,000 --> 00:35:37,000
One time I was in Halloween

852
00:35:37,000 --> 00:35:39,000
I was having a good time as an inch turtles

853
00:35:39,000 --> 00:35:41,000
And the story is really going nowhere

854
00:35:41,000 --> 00:35:45,000
I just want to try and talk and see how long it takes for me to land

855
00:35:45,000 --> 00:35:47,000
Let's see

856
00:35:47,000 --> 00:35:49,000
Oh, more talking

857
00:35:49,000 --> 00:35:53,000
I love on this beat

858
00:35:53,000 --> 00:35:57,000
I feel the same way

859
00:35:57,000 --> 00:36:01,000
I feel the same way

860
00:36:01,000 --> 00:36:03,000
I feel the same way

861
00:36:03,000 --> 00:36:05,000
Where we were just talking, in a different language

862
00:36:05,000 --> 00:36:09,000
Let's see

863
00:36:09,000 --> 00:36:11,000
Woo

864
00:36:17,000 --> 00:36:19,000
Who is even talking

865
00:36:19,000 --> 00:36:25,000
I just heard a language I am not familiar with

866
00:36:25,000 --> 00:36:29,000
Wow

867
00:36:29,000 --> 00:36:33,000
Who thinks I've placed your bets?

868
00:36:33,000 --> 00:36:37,000
Am I going to die right now?

869
00:36:37,000 --> 00:36:39,000
Am I going to die right now when I land?

870
00:36:39,000 --> 00:36:41,000
We'll find out

871
00:36:41,000 --> 00:36:45,000
It can't be somebody who is now chasing me

872
00:36:45,000 --> 00:36:49,000
And I have a feeling they are going to take me out

873
00:36:49,000 --> 00:36:51,000
Oh, it's burger boy

874
00:36:51,000 --> 00:36:53,000
He's like patrolling the sky

875
00:36:53,000 --> 00:36:55,000
He's like keeping his sight

876
00:36:55,000 --> 00:36:57,000
He's patrolling the airwaves

877
00:36:57,000 --> 00:36:59,000
There's a helicopter pat right here

878
00:36:59,000 --> 00:37:01,000
Why did I not come here to begin with?

879
00:37:01,000 --> 00:37:03,000
Is anybody like a secret helicopter pat?

880
00:37:03,000 --> 00:37:05,000
Does anybody know about this?

881
00:37:05,000 --> 00:37:09,000
There's no helicopter here

882
00:37:09,000 --> 00:37:11,000
Hey, look at that

883
00:37:11,000 --> 00:37:13,000
Two minutes

884
00:37:13,000 --> 00:37:15,000
That took two minutes, oh my god, what a long time

885
00:37:15,000 --> 00:37:17,000
Epic landing

886
00:37:17,000 --> 00:37:21,000
Let's just jump over here

887
00:37:21,000 --> 00:37:23,000
And okay

888
00:37:23,000 --> 00:37:25,000
I thought I was going to die

889
00:37:25,000 --> 00:37:27,000
Was it scary?

890
00:37:27,000 --> 00:37:29,000
You're at the airport

891
00:37:29,000 --> 00:37:31,000
I know, I'm fine

892
00:37:31,000 --> 00:37:33,000
I'm fine

893
00:37:33,000 --> 00:37:35,000
I'm flying the big one

894
00:37:35,000 --> 00:37:37,000
I feel like the big one has a little more control

895
00:37:37,000 --> 00:37:39,000
Who's that?

896
00:37:39,000 --> 00:37:41,000
Is that burger boy?

897
00:37:41,000 --> 00:37:43,000
It is

898
00:37:45,000 --> 00:37:47,000
Hold on, don't take off yet

899
00:37:47,000 --> 00:37:49,000
I'll never get in the mood

900
00:37:55,000 --> 00:37:59,000
I just hit him with the blades

901
00:38:11,000 --> 00:38:13,000
I'm sorry burger boy

902
00:38:13,000 --> 00:38:15,000
I'm sorry

903
00:38:15,000 --> 00:38:17,000
I'm so sorry

904
00:38:17,000 --> 00:38:19,000
I had to

905
00:38:19,000 --> 00:38:21,000
I don't think he died

906
00:38:21,000 --> 00:38:23,000
He's still alive

907
00:38:23,000 --> 00:38:25,000
I said he killed him

908
00:38:25,000 --> 00:38:27,000
Oh, I killed him

909
00:38:27,000 --> 00:38:29,000
I'm going

910
00:38:29,000 --> 00:38:31,000
I'm going

911
00:38:31,000 --> 00:38:33,000
Wait, Zeus

912
00:38:41,000 --> 00:38:45,000
Dude, can you imagine if you landed from that high up?

913
00:38:45,000 --> 00:38:47,000
If you landed like flat on your stomach

914
00:38:47,000 --> 00:38:51,000
Dude, you were inside, but just explode

915
00:38:51,000 --> 00:38:55,000
Oh, god, that would be so horrible

916
00:38:55,000 --> 00:38:59,000
You would not want to be at that crime scene, cleaning that up

917
00:38:59,000 --> 00:39:01,000
What?

918
00:39:01,000 --> 00:39:03,000
What the hell was that?

919
00:39:03,000 --> 00:39:05,000
That guy just

920
00:39:05,000 --> 00:39:09,000
Okay, I'll thank the car, fine

921
00:39:11,000 --> 00:39:15,000
Oh, that guy's got an automatic gun, goodbye

922
00:39:17,000 --> 00:39:19,000
Turn this way

923
00:39:19,000 --> 00:39:25,000
All right, I'm going to play in cinematic mode for the remainder of the game

924
00:39:29,000 --> 00:39:33,000
Look at this, oh, it's a trailer

925
00:39:33,000 --> 00:39:35,000
I wonder how long I can survive

926
00:39:35,000 --> 00:39:37,000
Oh, my god

927
00:39:41,000 --> 00:39:43,000
Hope everyone in the stream just saw that

928
00:39:43,000 --> 00:39:45,000
He can't, I like to hate you

929
00:39:45,000 --> 00:39:47,000
Dude, on my screen

930
00:39:47,000 --> 00:39:49,000
You just, how am I still?

931
00:39:49,000 --> 00:39:51,000
How am I still?

932
00:39:55,000 --> 00:39:59,000
Oh, I can't play this game for more than an hour, man

933
00:39:59,000 --> 00:40:03,000
And my head starts to hurt from laughing at like the nonsense

934
00:40:03,000 --> 00:40:05,000
Michael Bay present

935
00:40:05,000 --> 00:40:07,000
What?

936
00:40:07,000 --> 00:40:09,000
What is that?

937
00:40:09,000 --> 00:40:11,000
What is this?

938
00:40:11,000 --> 00:40:13,000
What is going on?

939
00:40:13,000 --> 00:40:19,000
Why am I like a teddy bear like hippopotamus?

940
00:40:19,000 --> 00:40:21,000
Why?

941
00:40:21,000 --> 00:40:23,000
Why?

942
00:40:23,000 --> 00:40:29,000
Why are we like a parade float?

943
00:40:29,000 --> 00:40:33,000
Get in, get in, get in, get in, get in

944
00:40:33,000 --> 00:40:35,000
Get in here

945
00:40:35,000 --> 00:40:37,000
Get in here

946
00:40:37,000 --> 00:40:41,000
We gotta get another person in this car

947
00:40:41,000 --> 00:40:43,000
Zeus is right above us

948
00:40:43,000 --> 00:40:45,000
Zeus, get in this car

949
00:40:45,000 --> 00:40:49,000
Take the other seat in here

950
00:40:49,000 --> 00:40:53,000
Somebody please get in there

951
00:40:53,000 --> 00:40:57,000
So we're gonna have like a siding can for a parade float

952
00:40:57,000 --> 00:40:59,000
Dude, who's trying to land right now?

Let's just try

955
00:41:03,000 --> 00:41:05,000
Look at what I'm trying

956
00:41:05,000 --> 00:41:09,000
All right, before I get into uncontrollable after

957
00:41:09,000 --> 00:41:13,000
When I turn, watch the heads go back into the car stall

958
00:41:19,000 --> 00:41:21,000
All right

959
00:41:21,000 --> 00:41:25,000
We don't have any of those

960
00:41:25,000 --> 00:41:27,000
Paulie the hippopotamus

961
00:41:27,000 --> 00:41:29,000
Let's play hungry hungry hungry

962
00:41:29,000 --> 00:41:31,000
Let's play hungry hungry hippos, ready?

So I'm gonna stay right here, you stay at opposite me

00:41:37,000 --> 00:41:39,000
And then just keep hitting control over and over again

967
00:41:39,000 --> 00:41:41,000
Hungry hungry hippos, ready?

968
00:41:47,000 --> 00:41:49,000
They're hungry hungry hippos

969
00:41:51,000 --> 00:41:53,000
Oh fuck

970
00:41:53,000 --> 00:41:55,000
Hey Zeus is right here

971
00:41:55,000 --> 00:41:59,000
Oh Zeus is a normal human

972
00:41:59,000 --> 00:42:01,000
Why is he normal?

973
00:42:01,000 --> 00:42:03,000
You must have died

974
00:42:03,000 --> 00:42:07,000
Oh well, all right, get in this new car, get in this like, camera

Oh, how does that happen?

977
00:42:15,000 --> 00:42:17,000
Are you guys in?

978
00:42:17,000 --> 00:42:19,000
Look at our heads

979
00:42:19,000 --> 00:42:21,000
All right, watch the heads when I turn

980
00:42:21,000 --> 00:42:23,000
This is the funniest damn thing ever

981
00:42:23,000 --> 00:42:27,000
I gotta get some speed

982
00:42:27,000 --> 00:42:29,000
I gotta get some speed, old dog

983
00:42:29,000 --> 00:42:31,000
Did it watch the heads

984
00:42:31,000 --> 00:42:33,000
Here we go, ready?

985
00:42:33,000 --> 00:42:35,000
All right, come on, look get out of this mode, I don't want this mode

986
00:42:35,000 --> 00:42:37,000
I want like the head mode

987
00:42:37,000 --> 00:42:39,000
I don't want to go too fast

988
00:42:39,000 --> 00:42:41,000
Oh, the spirit

989
00:42:41,000 --> 00:42:43,000
Look at her

990
00:42:43,000 --> 00:42:45,000
Oh

991
00:42:45,000 --> 00:42:47,000
How can I keep switching out?

992
00:42:47,000 --> 00:42:49,000
I want to see like the heads tilt

993
00:42:49,000 --> 00:42:53,000
This is the dumbest thing ever

994
00:42:53,000 --> 00:42:55,000
How did this happen

995
00:42:55,000 --> 00:42:57,000
I don't know, but it must be an advent in here

996
00:42:59,000 --> 00:43:01,000
Look at the heads, like

997
00:43:03,000 --> 00:43:05,000
We're looking like a Barney

998
00:43:09,000 --> 00:43:11,000
I feel like, all right, look at what this looks like right now

999
00:43:11,000 --> 00:43:15,000
This looks like America's like most wanted video tapes

1000
00:43:15,000 --> 00:43:17,000
And it's like what kind of criminals are we

1001
00:43:17,000 --> 00:43:19,000
You know what I mean?

1002
00:43:19,000 --> 00:43:21,000
Look at the criminals, driving away

1003
00:43:21,000 --> 00:43:23,000
And they're crazy costumes

1004
00:43:23,000 --> 00:43:25,000
Like they're trying to hide their identities

1005
00:43:25,000 --> 00:43:27,000
What way, what wouldn't you press the automatic?

1006
00:43:27,000 --> 00:43:31,000
It's a V until you get there

1007
00:43:31,000 --> 00:43:33,000
All right, here's the real kicker

1008
00:43:33,000 --> 00:43:35,000
Oh god, I'm out of control

1009
00:43:35,000 --> 00:43:37,000
All right, this is gonna be, I'm gonna laugh uncontrollably at this

1010
00:43:37,000 --> 00:43:39,000
All right, Zeus get in

1011
00:43:39,000 --> 00:43:45,000
America's most wanted, like the hungry, the hungry, hungry hippo

1012
00:43:45,000 --> 00:43:47,000
They robbed a liquor store

1013
00:43:47,000 --> 00:43:49,000
I'm gonna have like a couple of like view of us

1014
00:43:49,000 --> 00:43:51,000
Oh no, what was that?

1015
00:43:51,000 --> 00:43:53,000
Did he just kill us all?

1016
00:43:53,000 --> 00:43:57,000
Yeah, oh no, I don't have my hungry, hungry, hungry hippo head

1017
00:43:57,000 --> 00:43:59,000
Oh no

1018
00:44:01,000 --> 00:44:03,000
That was awesome

1019
00:44:03,000 --> 00:44:05,000
Oh my goodness gracious

1020
00:44:05,000 --> 00:44:09,000
Give us back hungry, hungry hippos

1021
00:44:11,000 --> 00:44:13,000
This is so funny

1022
00:44:13,000 --> 00:44:17,000
All right, so this

1023
00:44:17,000 --> 00:44:19,000
Oh, you should not shoot at the tires

1024
00:44:19,000 --> 00:44:21,000
That's our only vehicle

1025
00:44:21,000 --> 00:44:25,000
Oh, I think that's a good note to end on, to be honest

1026
00:44:25,000 --> 00:44:27,000
That seriously, that was...

1027
00:44:27,000 --> 00:44:29,000
It's not a pretzel for how that happened

1028
00:44:29,000 --> 00:44:31,000
There was probably an admin in here or something

1029
00:44:31,000 --> 00:44:33,000
I have no idea, but that was absolutely hysterical

1030
00:44:33,000 --> 00:44:35,000
Hippo Burgers

1031
00:44:35,000 --> 00:44:37,000
All right, let me get on that bike

1032
00:44:37,000 --> 00:44:39,000
All right, wait, wait, wait

1033
00:44:39,000 --> 00:44:41,000
Here's how we're gonna end it

1034
00:44:41,000 --> 00:44:43,000
There's how we're gonna end it guys, ready?

1035
00:44:43,000 --> 00:44:45,000
Everybody, everybody get into where we're standing right now

1036
00:44:45,000 --> 00:44:47,000
We're gonna have a giant boxing match

1037
00:44:47,000 --> 00:44:49,000
And the last man standing wins

1038
00:44:49,000 --> 00:44:53,000
So don't not yet, no, take the knife, put the knife away

1039
00:44:53,000 --> 00:44:55,000
Put the knife away

1040
00:44:55,000 --> 00:44:57,000
Put the knife away

1041
00:44:57,000 --> 00:44:59,000
So everyone get to where we're standing and no knives

1042
00:44:59,000 --> 00:45:01,000
Only boxing

1043
00:45:01,000 --> 00:45:03,000
So if we all, if we, ready?

1044
00:45:03,000 --> 00:45:05,000
This is how it's gonna end, make sure we get everybody here

1045
00:45:05,000 --> 00:45:07,000
So this is how we're gonna end it

1046
00:45:07,000 --> 00:45:09,000
Wait, not yet, not yet

1047
00:45:09,000 --> 00:45:11,000
Burgers, watch me in the face

1048
00:45:11,000 --> 00:45:13,000
All right, wait, Burgermy stop it, Burgermy

1049
00:45:13,000 --> 00:45:15,000
I don't think he's even like watching this stream

1050
00:45:15,000 --> 00:45:17,000
All right, ready?

1051
00:45:17,000 --> 00:45:21,000
So three, two, one, boxing fight, go!

1052
00:45:21,000 --> 00:45:23,000
No

1053
00:45:23,000 --> 00:45:25,000
Burgermy, you just disappeared

1054
00:45:25,000 --> 00:45:27,000
I'm not over here punching people

1055
00:45:27,000 --> 00:45:29,000
Oh, I'm going down, I'm going down

1056
00:45:29,000 --> 00:45:31,000
No, I wanna run, I wanna get on top of the car

1057
00:45:31,000 --> 00:45:33,000
Like jumping punch

1058
00:45:33,000 --> 00:45:35,000
I'm gonna jump in the car

1059
00:45:35,000 --> 00:45:37,000
I'm gonna jump in the car

1060
00:45:37,000 --> 00:45:39,000
I'm gonna jump in the car

1061
00:45:39,000 --> 00:45:41,000
I'm gonna jump in the car

1062
00:45:41,000 --> 00:45:43,000
I'm gonna jump in the car

1063
00:45:43,000 --> 00:45:45,000
I'm gonna jump in the car, like jumping punch

1064
00:45:51,000 --> 00:45:53,000
People are like running away

1065
00:45:53,000 --> 00:45:55,000
Oh, he's gonna say hello on health

1066
00:45:59,000 --> 00:46:01,000
I love how nobody's even grunting or talking

1067
00:46:01,000 --> 00:46:03,000
So it's just like silence, ready?

1068
00:46:03,000 --> 00:46:05,000
Like

1069
00:46:05,000 --> 00:46:09,000
I'm just like, dude, dude, dude, dude, dude, dude, dude, dude, dude

00:46:09,000 --> 00:46:11,000
Dude, gang up on Burger Boy, don't let him win

1071
00:46:11,000 --> 00:46:13,000
Don't let Burger Boy win

1072
00:46:13,000 --> 00:46:15,000
Gang up

1073
00:46:15,000 --> 00:46:17,000
Burger Boy's dead

1074
00:46:17,000 --> 00:46:19,000
Oh, I'm dead

1075
00:46:19,000 --> 00:46:23,000

And you know the win?

1081
00:46:33,000 --> 00:46:35,000
A knife to the face

1082
00:46:35,000 --> 00:46:39,000
Oh, now they're bringing out guns

1083
00:46:41,000 --> 00:46:43,000
Oh, my god

1084
00:46:43,000 --> 00:46:45,000
Oh, man

1085

That was awesome

1086
00:46:47,000 --> 00:46:49,000
Oh

1087
00:46:49,000 --> 00:46:53,000
That was amazing

1088
00:46:53,000 --> 00:47:01,000
So if you missed it, if you missed some of the, we've been playing for about just about an hour now

1089
00:47:01,000 --> 00:47:05,000
Oh, if you missed, if you just got here or something, this is all gonna be on YouTube tomorrow

1090
00:47:05,000 --> 00:47:07,000
So

1091
00:47:07,000 --> 00:47:11,000
There were some hysterical things that happened in this

1092
00:47:11,000 --> 00:47:15,000
Like if you just joined us, you're gonna want to watch, you're gonna want to watch it tomorrow

1093
00:47:15,000 --> 00:47:17,000
Okay

1094
00:47:17,000 --> 00:47:21,000
Alright, it's time for some QWOP

1095
00:47:21,000 --> 00:47:23,000
That was an else driver

1096
00:47:23,000 --> 00:47:27,000
So what was my final death count?

1097
00:47:27,000 --> 00:47:29,000
25

1098
00:47:29,000 --> 00:47:31,000
Oh, god

1099
00:47:31,000 --> 00:47:33,000
Wait, does it say?

1100
00:47:33,000 --> 00:47:35,000
No, they've been counting in the stream

1101
00:47:35,000 --> 00:47:43,000
Alright, thanks a lot for playing, guys, if you played, I'll probably do this again

1102
00:47:43,000 --> 00:47:49,000
This was actually pretty damn fun, so thanks for coming, if you joined into the game and at the session

1103
00:47:49,000 --> 00:47:51,000
So now we're gonna play some QWOP

1104
00:47:51,000 --> 00:47:53,000
And yeah, thanks so much, guys

1105
00:47:53,000 --> 00:47:55,000
Oh

1106
00:47:55,000 --> 00:47:57,000
Oh

1107
00:47:57,000 --> 00:48:01,000
That was a shot in the face

1108
00:48:01,000 --> 00:48:03,000
Alright, let me pull up

1109
00:48:03,000 --> 00:48:05,000
How do I get out of here, leave game

1110
00:48:05,000 --> 00:48:11,000
Alright, it's gonna be a black screen until I get co-op loaded

1111
00:48:11,000 --> 00:48:15,000
QWOP, co-op, co-op, co-op, co-op

1112
00:48:15,000 --> 00:48:19,000
Hey, yo, yo

1113
00:48:19,000 --> 00:48:23,000
I love Liberty City

1114
00:48:23,000 --> 00:48:27,000
Co-op is a, it's like, it's a flash game

1115
00:48:27,000 --> 00:48:29,000
It's a flash game

1116
00:48:29,000 --> 00:48:35,000
Where you have to use QW and then OP to run and it is incredibly difficult

1117
00:48:35,000 --> 00:48:41,000
So screens, actually screens probably not gonna go black, it's probably gonna be just my background

1118
00:48:41,000 --> 00:48:45,000
Yep, just my desktop background

1119
00:48:45,000 --> 00:48:49,000
Alright, let me

1120
00:48:49,000 --> 00:48:53,000
Pull up some co-op

1121
00:48:53,000 --> 00:48:57,000
Let me make sure the stream thing is there

1122
00:48:57,000 --> 00:49:01,000
Oh man, that was funny

1123
00:49:01,000 --> 00:49:05,000
That was so damn funny

1124
00:49:05,000 --> 00:49:11,000
QWOP, co-op, co-op, co-op

1125
00:49:11,000 --> 00:49:13,000
Co-op

1126
00:49:13,000 --> 00:49:17,000
Ding-ding-ding-ding-ding-ding-ding-ding-ding-ding

1127
00:49:17,000 --> 00:49:23,000
