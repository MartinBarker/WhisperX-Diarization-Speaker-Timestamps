1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,000
Let's see if I can do it with Samson.

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:10,000
All fingers are pointing to no.

3
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:19,000
So let's go guys.

4
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:20,000
So sit.

5
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:21,000
Wait, why?

6
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:23,000
Why do I have a spirit heart?

7
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:27,000
I'm not exactly sure why that happened.

8
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:32,000
It should be right off the bat, but okay, so Samson works.

9
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:36,000
Every time you hit an enemy, you get stronger tears.

10
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:39,000
Like every 5-10 hits or something like that, you get stronger.

11
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:40,000
See how I'm turning red?

12
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:45,000
I got like a pink kind of tinge to my body right now.

13
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:48,000
Means I'm doing a little bit more damage.

14
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:49,000
Every hit.

15
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:55,000
But as you can tell, he has only one heart, so it's just like, nope, you're going to die.

16
00:00:55,000 --> 00:01:00,000
Why is envy in like the first room and the first level?

17
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,000
That's just a lot of Malarkey if you ask me.

18
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:07,000
Oh my god, why is this guy blue?

19
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:11,000
It has like a grape.

20
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:15,000
Hello from Alabama.

21
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:18,000
Hello from Boston.

22
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:20,000
City of Boston.

23
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:22,000
Well I keep living in a good hit.

24
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:29,000
City of hot dogs, right lights and a Boston Reds box.

25
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:36,000
Oh that didn't take forever.

26
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:37,000
Is it every kill?

27
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:40,000
Okay, it's every kill then.

28
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:44,000
So it can be pretty, if you get a lot of HP up, he can be pretty powerful.

29
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:49,000
But of course we're in the spider room, so I'm probably going to die right now.

30
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:56,000
Oh god, this is the worst.

31
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:59,000
If I die in this room, I swear.

32
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:00,000
I should have already been dead to be honest.

33
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:04,000
I don't know where that spirit heart even came from.

34
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:05,000
I should be dead right now.

35
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:08,000
But I'm going to take it and stride.

36
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:09,000
You know what?

37
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:10,000
I got a second chance.

38
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:13,000
It's time to do this thing.

39
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:16,000
Alright, come on.

40
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:18,000
Come on you like cupcake.

41
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:21,000
You meat cupcake.

42
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:26,000
Let's get that item.

43
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:28,000
Have I met the scouting Boston?

44
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:34,000
Yeah, I seem like riding his bike all the time.

45
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:40,000
He's always riding around wicked fast like a psycho.

46
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:44,000
Oh, so he got buffed.

47
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:45,000
That's what it is.

48
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:46,000
Alright.

49
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:48,000
What about Judas?

50
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:51,000
So why would you ever play as Judas now?

51
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:55,000
Isn't Judas have one heart or does he have two?

52
00:02:55,000 --> 00:03:02,000
If that's a buff, I can't think of a reason why you would ever play as anybody else.

53
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:04,000
Well, we're Judas at least.

54
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:08,000
Come on, blow up the secret room.

55
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:10,000
Okay, I don't think I'm going to make it.

56
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:11,000
I don't think I'm going to do this.

57
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:13,000
Yep, it's widow.

58
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:14,000
I don't think I'm going to do this, guys.

59
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:16,000
I might have to stock this over again.

60
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:18,000
Oh, no, no way.

61
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:19,000
No way.

62
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:20,000
Not a chance.

63
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:21,000
Not a chance.

64
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:24,000
We're going to reach right.

65
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:25,000
Okay.

66
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:31,000
Alright, hopefully I don't run into the spider boss again.

67
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:35,000
I don't think I will because we're not in the spider catacombe place right now.

68
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:37,000
Oh, don't worry.

69
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:38,000
I'm not going to rage.

70
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:43,000
I'm not going to rage yet.

71
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:44,000
Getting shots.

72
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:46,000
Good, good, good, good.

73
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:50,000
Hey, it's always good to get your binding and Isaac deaths out of the way in the very

74
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:54,000
beginning, especially when you play on the stupid spider level.

75
00:03:54,000 --> 00:04:00,000
That's way too hot.

76
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:06,000
I think the spider level shouldn't be able to spawn until at least the second and third

77
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:10,000
rub because if you play it as a character like this, it's no way you're going to beat

78
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:12,000
that spider boss with one heart.

79
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:13,000
This is no way.

80
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:19,000
I mean, I guess he could if you were really good.

81
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:26,000
Alright, doing much better.

82
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:30,000
Let's continue down here.

83
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:38,000
Yeah, I was a little late today to the stream and that's because I actually went out last

84
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:45,000
night for the first time in a very long time and I got a little under the weather as they

85
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:51,000
say and woke up a little too late.

86
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:55,000
But should I get the key and get the crate?

87
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:56,000
Why am I saying crate?

88
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:58,000
Too many games to crate lately.

89
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:01,000
No, we're not going to do that yet.

90
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:03,000
I don't think it's worth it.

91
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:08,000
Yeah, unless you're like a character like Kane or even Isaac can probably do it.

92
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:09,000
All the other...

93
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:12,000
Oh, Magdalene can do with Magdalene.

94
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:17,000
Let's keep going this way.

95
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:20,000
Look at that.

96
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:21,000
You bugs.

97
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:24,000
Whoa, didn't even see that guy.

98
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:26,000
I came out of nowhere.

99
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:37,000
I didn't even check my review mirror.

100
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:40,000
How could you ever delete the binding of Isaac?

101
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:43,000
This game is too good.

102
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:48,000
Everything about this game is good.

103
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:50,000
Except there's one bad part about this game.

104
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:52,000
It has to end.

105
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:56,000
Like when you're playing it has to be like over.

106
00:05:56,000 --> 00:06:00,000
Ooh, aces fades.

107
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:04,000
The aces fades.

108
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:07,000
No, not doing that.

109
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:08,000
Not with Samson.

110
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:13,000
Well, let me walk over the spikes.

111
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:15,000
That's a great idea.

112
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:19,000
Oh, I want that chest.

113
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:26,000
But I don't want that chest because it might be something not worth it.

114
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:27,000
Decisions, decisions.

115
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:28,000
Oh, you know what, Yolo?

116
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:29,000
You only live once.

117
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:30,000
Let's do it.

118
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:33,000
I'm opening this chest.

119
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:37,000
All right, give me something good.

120
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:41,000
Don't hit that habit, yeah.

121
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:44,000
That was so worth it.

122
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:47,000
Oh, well, you know what?

123
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:49,000
You got to take risks sometimes.

124
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:52,000
It's not going to pay off.

125
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:55,000
It's apparently...

126
00:06:55,000 --> 00:07:00,000
All right, let's go and look at this guy's butt.

127
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:02,000
All right, Master-O.

128
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:05,000
Oh, two Master-O's.

129
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:08,000
That's not a very good thing.

130
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:14,000
And you got to fight two of the same Master-O.

131
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:16,000
Come on, Burger Boy.

132
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:19,000
Come on, Burger Boy.

133
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:21,000
Oh, come on.

134
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:29,000
Why did it have to be Monstros?

135
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:32,000
They're just so happy.

136
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:34,000
I feel like these guys aren't even really trying to hurt me.

137
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:35,000
They're just trying to play.

138
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:36,000
They're looking at them.

139
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:39,000
They're just like, hey, I just wanted to jump and throw up.

140
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:40,000
Oh, God.

141
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:47,000
Well, one of them just go away.

142
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:50,000
Just go away.

143
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:52,000
Come on.

144
00:07:52,000 --> 00:08:01,000
Oh, my God.

145
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:02,000
You bastard.

146
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:06,000
Why is this still two?

147
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:12,000
Okay, gee, it took to like 10% health to get one of these bastards out of here.

148
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:13,000
Okay.

149
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:17,000
We're good to go.

150
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:18,000
Two hearts.

151
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:21,000
We got it.

152
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:22,000
Wait.

153
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:23,000
Wait.

154
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:24,000
Wait.

155
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:25,000
Do I have any bombs?

156
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:27,000
I do not have any bombs, so I got it.

157
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:30,000
Just go.

158
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:32,000
Who is Burger Boy really?

159
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:34,000
Burger Boy is one of...

160
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:35,000
Oh, Curse of Darkness.

161
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:36,000
This is...

162
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:37,000
Ah.

163
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:41,000
Burger Boy is one of my real life good friends.

164
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:43,000
And he's also crazy.

165
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:44,000
But that's good.

166
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:45,000
That's like a good quality.

167
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:50,000
Because we're all crazy.

168
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:57,000
But Burger Boy is also the egg.

169
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:59,000
And there's a...

170
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:02,000
Might be a special video coming soon.

171
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:06,000
Coming soon, not like tomorrow, not like next week.

172
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:08,000
But there might be the return of the egg.

173
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:15,000
That's the only thing I'm gonna say.

174
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:19,000
The egg.

175
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:24,000
Best worst character ever.

176
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:25,000
Mm-hmm.

177
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:27,000
What's this?

178
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:28,000
The Emperor.

179
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:29,000
Alright.

180
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:32,000
Forget what you do.

181
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:37,000
But that's alright.

182
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:38,000
You know, I actually...

183
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:40,000
I'm actually one of those people that really liked Meet the Pyro.

184
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:43,000
A lot of people liked it, but a lot of people really didn't like it either.

185
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:48,000
I'll tell you one thing though, I think Meet the Pyro was too short.

186
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:52,000
If there's one complaint I have about Meet the Pyro, it was too short.

187
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:56,000
Because I mean, they gave us Meet the Spy, which was like three and a half minutes.

188
00:09:56,000 --> 00:10:00,000
Then they gave us Meet the Medic, which was like four minutes.

189
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:03,000
And then it's like, oh man, they're getting crazier and crazier.

190
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:06,000
Like more cinematic and more cinematic as they go.

191
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:10,000
And then Meet the Pyro was like two minutes and 22 seconds.

192
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:13,000
That's the only complaint I have.

193
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:17,000
Now, I'll tell you what you did to the boss room.

194
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:18,000
Good to know.

195
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:19,000
Good to know.

196
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:20,000
And I...

197
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:26,000
Sorry, I must be crazy.

198
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:27,000
I have another spirit heart.

199
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:31,000
Did I walk over one and just not even pay attention?

200
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:31,000
Or do you...

201
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:40,000
Every time you kill like 20 people at Samson, you get a spirit heart?

202
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:42,000
Maybe I'm just crazy.

203
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:44,000
But I mean, after the inner...

204
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:47,000
I think they could have done the interview stuff a little bit longer.

205
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:52,000
You know, in the spies, like, what kind of inhumane, just horrible, disgusting thoughts, sort of,

206
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:54,000
whatever he says.

207
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:56,000
If they flesh that out a little bit more, maybe get a couple more characters, like get

208
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:58,000
the sniper to say some stuff.

209
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:01,000
Alright, let's do it.

210
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:05,000
Alright, I'm not going in that room.

211
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:09,000
They blew the budget on the special effects.

212
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:16,000
Get away from me.

213
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:17,000
He's gonna...

214
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:21,000
This guy's gonna be hard to kill with this spoon.

215
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:22,000
It's gonna...

216
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:26,000
You know, it's gonna attack the things around him and not him.

217
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:32,000
Sorry, I can wait it out.

218
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:36,000
I'm also glad that the Pyro's gender is a secret to the couple of you guys that are saying

219
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:37,000
that right now.

220
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:38,000
I don't know.

221
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:43,000
When you have a mystery like that, you gotta keep it a mystery.

222
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:45,000
It's just like when you read a book, right?

223
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:49,000
If I read a book, and it's like you don't know what the character looks like, you get to

224
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:52,000
make up your own kind of version of the character.

225
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:54,000
Because everybody has their own Pyro.

226
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:58,000
I mean, I'll bring up a friend of mine.

227
00:11:58,000 --> 00:11:59,000
Boo, you guys know a boo.

228
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:03,000
Boo has like the best perfect description of the Pyro.

229
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:08,000
It's just like a cute, just like cuddly little entity that runs around and just has fun.

230
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:11,000
Like that there is no man or woman.

231
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:13,000
It's just the Pyro.

232
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:19,000
I think that's perfect.

233
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:21,000
The Pyro is not a man or a woman.

234
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:22,000
It is a thing.

235
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:24,000
It's just a mindset.

236
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:26,000
It's an entity.

237
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:27,000
Okay.

238
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:32,000
I'm absolutely not doing either of those.

239
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:36,000
Ew, who reads books.

240
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:40,000
I'm not miss.

241
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:41,000
I gotta go.

242
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:48,000
I gotta go down.

243
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:54,000
I would use the Source Film Maker if I had any idea how to use it.

244
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:57,000
The Source Film Maker is one of those things where you really have to sit down and play

245
00:12:57,000 --> 00:13:00,000
with it and be good with it and learn.

246
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:05,000
And artistically I was never really an art student.

247
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:07,000
I mean, I can, I went to school for film.

248
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:09,000
I could probably use it.

249
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:12,000
I could probably do like shots with it and stuff.

250
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:18,000
But once you get to the animation part of things, there's no way I would ever do it.

251
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:20,000
I didn't know what to do with that program.

252
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:23,000
Because I tried Gary's mod, even just like do anted, little dumb animations and little

253
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:26,000
dumb things in Gary's mod.

254
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:29,000
And they always end up as complete atrocities.

255
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:31,000
Like complete and like just horrible things.

256
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:34,000
Like, oh, I want to get like the heavy to smile and point his finger and he just ends

257
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:36,000
up going like, oh get it.

258
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:38,000
Like his hand comes up.

259
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:41,000
I'm just not good with art.

260
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:44,000
I wish I was though.

261
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:45,000
He agreed.

262
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:49,000
Oh no, please don't show me.

263
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:50,000
Wow.

264
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:51,000
Wow.

265
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:52,000
Wow.

266
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:58,000
I was going to say there's no way I'm that lucky to touch like five of the cut.

267
00:13:58,000 --> 00:13:59,000
Oh my god.

268
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:05,000
Now I'm just being an idiot.

269
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:10,000
It's these stupid things that are in the way.

270
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:14,000
I suppose they have homing shots.

271
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:17,000
Come on now.

272
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:21,000
Oh, I hate Epicak.

273
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:26,000
I absolutely hate Epicak but I'm going to take it.

274
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:32,000
I really don't like Epicak and it's probably going to kill me but you know what?

275
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:34,000
I'm going to take it.

276
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:37,000
See if I can find the secret room.

277
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:40,000
This is full heart up here.

278
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:41,000
Okay, this too.

279
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:44,000
Good to know.

280
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:51,000
Oh no, no, no, it's homing too.

281
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:53,000
Oh my god, I forgot about that.

282
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:55,000
Oh man, this is bad.

283
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:56,000
This is really bad.

284
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:58,000
This is really bad.

285
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:03,000
I'm going to kill myself with this.

286
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:05,000
Guaranteed because it's homing.

287
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:10,000
Oh my god.

288
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:15,000
Oh no.

289
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:19,000
Oh no.

290
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:22,000
I'm blowing this up.

291
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:24,000
Cool.

292
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:31,000
Yeah, this is definitely a run that is in the tank in my opinion.

293
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:35,000
This is no way I'm going to do this because it's homing.

294
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:42,000
I will open you though.

295
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:46,000
Oh, I'm not going to.

296
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:47,000
Oh, it's over.

297
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:49,000
Oh, it's over.

298
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:51,000
Like a bit.

299
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:55,000
I'm getting out of here.

300
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:59,000
I can't believe I survived that.

301
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:03,000
The only thing this is going to be good for is bosses.

302
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:04,000
That's it.

303
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:10,000
Barely, barely that.

304
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:14,000
Oh.

305
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:19,000
What did I have for dinner last night?

306
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:22,000
I think I had a chicken sandwich.

307
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:23,000
Pretty sure.

308
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:24,000
Oh, wow.

309
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:32,000
I can't believe I got hit by that.

310
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:39,000
This is taking so much longer because I have to keep going back and healing myself.

311
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:44,000
No, super secret room there.

312
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:51,000
Super secret room is probably all the way to the right if there is one here.

313
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:53,000
Bunk.

314
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:55,000
Oh god.

315
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:56,000
Super wrath, huh?

316
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:59,000
I don't think I've never faced super wrath.

317
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:00,000
Oh, no.

318
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:04,000
He does not do that.

319
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:06,000
He does troll bombs?

320
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:08,000
Like the big ones that follow you?

321
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:12,000
I guess it doesn't learn a matter because he's dead.

322
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:16,000
Starry's blast damage.

323
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:18,000
Just blast damage.

324
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:20,000
Incorporate.

325
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:22,000
Epic Act shots.

326
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:24,000
Oops.

327
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:31,000
Why am I not watching the soccer finals?

328
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:34,000
I'm not a big soccer guy.

329
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:36,000
I never really was.

330
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:37,000
I grew up on baseball.

331
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:39,000
Baseball is my thing.

332
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:41,000
Where's his peep?

333
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:42,000
Oh.

334
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:44,000
Well, this might be like good.

335
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:46,000
Maybe I'll kill him easily with this epic act.

336
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:47,000
Oh god.

337
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:48,000
Yeah, this is all right.

338
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:49,000
I'm going to be good.

339
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:53,000
I'm going to be good to go.

340
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:55,000
Epic Act.

341
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:56,000
Oh god.

342
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:57,000
Bunk.

343
00:17:57,000 --> 00:18:08,000
I'll take the tears up even though I don't really want it.

344
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:14,000
And let's go.

345
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:20,000
Yeah, I'm definitely dead soon.

346
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:24,000
I am absolutely dead soon.

347
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:25,000
Oh, screw you.

348
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:28,000
You aren't getting any of my hearts.

349
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:31,000
You aren't getting my heart.

350
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:36,000
Oh, it's stupid.

351
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:38,000
Actually, that's not that bad.

352
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:42,000
There's one who's going to stay away from it.

353
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:47,000
Favorite baseball team is the Boston Red Sox.

354
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:52,000
I live in Boston, so.

355
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:55,000
Well, I don't live in Boston.

356
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:57,000
I live right next to it.

357
00:18:57,000 --> 00:18:59,000
Put it that way.

358
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:02,000
Oh, and get smashed.

359
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:05,000
Oh, no.

360
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:08,000
Oh, no.

361
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:09,000
No, no.

362
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:11,000
I can't shoot this.

363
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:13,000
Oh, come on.

364
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:15,000
Oh, come on.

365
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:19,000
This is the worst.

366
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:21,000
This is the worst thing.

367
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:22,000
Oh!

368
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:27,000
What's this?

369
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:29,000
Poison bomb school.

370
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:31,000
Well, I think this is the end of Samson.

371
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:33,000
Let's find out.

372
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:36,000
Unless I get a heart right here.

373
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:37,000
The sun.

374
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:40,000
OK, I'm going to stay alive.

375
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:41,000
What's in this next room?

376
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:43,000
Goodbye.

377
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:44,000
Sorry.

378
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:46,000
I was not dealing with that, not a chance.

379
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:55,000
I'm probably not going to do a GTA IV.

380
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:57,000
Let's play her a walkthrough.

381
00:19:57,000 --> 00:19:59,000
GTA V, though.

382
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:03,000
I will probably do a some type of walkthrough.

383
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:07,000
Maybe a Let's player or something, because I love GTA games so much.

384
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:13,000
I can't shoot that.

385
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:14,000
What's going here?

386
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:16,000
Of course it's greed.

387
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:20,000
Why else would it be anybody else but greed?

388
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:24,000
At least it's a steam sale.

389
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:29,000
Mike Lowell is my favorite Red Sox player of all time.

390
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:30,000
Mike Lowell.

391
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:38,000
Epic hack, you are the worst.

392
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:45,000
Oh, I've won, Dad.

393
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:51,000
It's good for those guys.

394
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:52,000
I will say that for sure.

395
00:20:57,000 --> 00:20:58,000
Oh.

396
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:03,000
OK.

397
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:07,000
No, no, no, no, get away.

398
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:07,000
Good.

399
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:12,000
I'm stuck.

400
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:14,000
Get.

401
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:15,000
I can't hit these bugs.

402
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:26,000
Strike one.

403
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:26,000
Strike two.

404
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:27,000
Strike three.

405
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:28,000
Strike four.

406
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:28,000
OK, there we go.

407
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:34,000
All right, boss.

408
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:36,000
I am shocked that I've gotten this far.

409
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:38,000
I am legitimately shocked.

410
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:42,000
You know what we're going to do this already?

411
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:44,000
Hey, what's going on?

412
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:46,000
What's going on, buddy?

413
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:47,000
How are you doing?

414
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:49,000
You want like some of my hearts?

415
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:51,000
Eat this.

416
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:52,000
I missed.

417
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:53,000
Eat this.

418
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:55,000
Run.

419
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:56,000
Who's talking to me?

420
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:00,000
Getting tweets all over the place.

421
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:07,000
All right, let's fight this guy.

422
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:09,000
Oh, fantastic.

423
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:10,000
Well, it was nice knowing you guys.

424
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:13,000
I'm sure I'll be like in the afterlife as Samson.

425
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:15,000
Maybe not.

426
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:15,000
Maybe not.

427
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:17,000
Wow.

428
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:18,000
All right.

429
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:23,000
I'll take that.

430
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:24,000
I'll take a swift victory.

431
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:32,000
Oh, I want mommy.

432
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:33,000
Carthus of the labyrinth.

433
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:34,000
That's exactly what I wanted.

434
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:36,000
That's I'm glad.

435
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:38,000
Oh, no.

436
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:39,000
No, boy.

437
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:40,000
Oh, my God.

438
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:42,000
Oh, my God.

439
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:42,000
Oh, my God.

440
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:46,000
I can't even handle this right now.

441
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:47,000
Yeah.

442
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:51,000
Well, now the jig is up.

443
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:56,000
Unless I pull off some real ridiculous moves,

444
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:59,000
I am not doing this.

445
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:00,000
Well, bombs are key.

446
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:01,000
I actually would rather have that.

447
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:04,000
Thank you.

448
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:06,000
This could be the end right here.

449
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:08,000
I'm going to probably say time to be quiet.

450
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:11,000
Go to try hard, well, to not scream when I die.

451
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:12,000
Because that's probably what I'm going to do.

452
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:33,000
Oh, come on.

453
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:34,000
Oh, my God.

454
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:39,000
All right.

455
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:41,000
OK.

456
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:44,000
As long as you take it slow and steady, just like the turtle,

457
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:46,000
you don't got to be the hair.

458
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:49,000
OK, but now.

459
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:54,000
No.

460
00:23:58,000 --> 00:23:59,000
Oh.

461
00:23:59,000 --> 00:24:00,000
Oh.

462
00:24:09,000 --> 00:24:11,000
All right.

463
00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:14,000
It hurts every time playing this game.

464
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:16,000
I might want to just go.

465
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:18,000
I don't know.

466
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:18,000
I don't know.

467
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:22,000
I really have one heart.

468
00:24:27,000 --> 00:24:28,000
Now I'll die.

469
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:32,000
I need more stuff.

470
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:34,000
That's not what I needed.

471
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:36,000
I'm afraid to even attempt to get in here.

472
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:37,000
Oh, my God.

473
00:24:45,000 --> 00:24:47,000
You know what was going to happen?

474
00:24:47,000 --> 00:24:49,000
I got it over with.

475
00:24:49,000 --> 00:24:51,000
I got it over with her purpose.

476
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:02,000
How come that killed me, by the way?

477
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:06,000
I thought it only did a.

478
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:10,000
I thought it only did one half heart.

479
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:13,000
Why did I die from that?

480
00:25:13,000 --> 00:25:14,000
Oh, whatever.

481
00:25:19,000 --> 00:25:22,000
Let's just go straight up Isaac.

482
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:26,000
Isaac never did me wrong.

483
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:30,000
Samson, you're too hard with your no hearts.

484
00:25:33,000 --> 00:25:40,000
I'm going to take this game by the horns with Isaac.

485
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:40,000
Attack fly.

486
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:42,000
That's good start.

487
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:45,000
I'm going to beat this right up.

488
00:25:45,000 --> 00:25:49,000
You see that just maybe so sad that I'm going to beat this

489
00:25:49,000 --> 00:25:50,000
now.

490
00:25:58,000 --> 00:25:59,000
Got the key.

491
00:25:59,000 --> 00:26:00,000
All right.

492
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:02,000
OK.

493
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:02,000
Come on, flies.

494
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:03,000
What do you got to get?

495
00:26:03,000 --> 00:26:04,000
Isaac, grab it.

496
00:26:11,000 --> 00:26:13,000
I'm speaking about those spikes again.

497
00:26:13,000 --> 00:26:17,000
I swear that I mean, I had one heart.

498
00:26:17,000 --> 00:26:19,000
Why would it do more than one heart worth of damage?

499
00:26:19,000 --> 00:26:20,000
Maybe they changed it.

500
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:22,000
Or maybe I'm just not smart enough to understand.

501
00:26:25,000 --> 00:26:26,000
Oh, yeah.

502
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:27,000
Keep throwing.

503
00:26:27,000 --> 00:26:27,000
Bugs at me.

504
00:26:27,000 --> 00:26:29,000
And then you run them over yourself.

505
00:26:33,000 --> 00:26:35,000
Isaac.

506
00:26:35,000 --> 00:26:38,000
Isaac.

507
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:40,000
Actually, I'd rather stay up here,

508
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:42,000
keeping from moving around so much.

509
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:44,000
Whoa.

510
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:45,000
Wow.

511
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:49,000
There you go.

512
00:26:49,000 --> 00:26:51,000
Kill your own dudes.

513
00:26:51,000 --> 00:26:53,000
That's what I like to say.

514
00:26:53,000 --> 00:26:57,000
Now that's what I like to say, Samson.

515
00:26:57,000 --> 00:26:58,000
Not that though.

516
00:26:58,000 --> 00:27:01,000
Get away.

517
00:27:01,000 --> 00:27:06,000
Whoa.

518
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:07,000
Dodge and bounce here.

519
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:13,000
Come on.

520
00:27:13,000 --> 00:27:14,000
You can hit me.

521
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:16,000
You can do better than that.

522
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:17,000
You can do better than that.

523
00:27:21,000 --> 00:27:21,000
Keep me.

524
00:27:25,000 --> 00:27:25,000
Jump.

525
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:29,000
I'm smoking this game.

526
00:27:29,000 --> 00:27:33,000
I'm going to smoke this whole game right now.

527
00:27:33,000 --> 00:27:37,000
As the title character, as Isaac.

528
00:27:37,000 --> 00:27:37,000
Screw that thing.

529
00:27:37,000 --> 00:27:38,000
I don't want it.

530
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:46,000
Bam.

531
00:27:49,000 --> 00:27:53,000
I wish they would come out with binding of Isaac 2

532
00:27:53,000 --> 00:27:56,000
and have it be like not single player.

533
00:27:56,000 --> 00:27:59,000
Have it be you can have more than one or two people in the game,

534
00:27:59,000 --> 00:28:02,000
or probably two more than two would be ridiculous.

535
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:07,000
All right, let's go.

536
00:28:07,000 --> 00:28:09,000
Cupcake.

537
00:28:09,000 --> 00:28:12,000
You velvet cupcake batter.

538
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:18,000
Speed and range up.

539
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:22,000
And I look like a freaking psycho.

540
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:22,000
Yeah.

541
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:24,000
Yeah.

542
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:25,000
Nickel.

543
00:28:25,000 --> 00:28:26,000
All right.

544
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:27,000
Got a nickel.

545
00:28:27,000 --> 00:28:28,000
Good to go.

546
00:28:33,000 --> 00:28:34,000
Let's go.

547
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:36,000
You uncooked chicken.

548
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:37,000
You can't kill me.

549
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:46,000
I think a bull was telling me that he 100% of this game,

550
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:49,000
which like that's incredible.

551
00:28:49,000 --> 00:28:50,000
What a boss.

552
00:28:50,000 --> 00:28:58,000
It's a very nice, not an easy feat to complete like everything in this game.

553
00:28:58,000 --> 00:28:58,000
It really isn't.

554
00:29:03,000 --> 00:29:05,000
See, you like use it on the secret room, which is probably right here.

555
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:15,000
Well, apparently it wasn't right there.

556
00:29:15,000 --> 00:29:18,000
Probably was down this hall somewhere.

557
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:19,000
But you know, I can take it.

558
00:29:19,000 --> 00:29:20,000
Whatever.

559
00:29:25,000 --> 00:29:29,000
My favorite holiday is definitely Halloween.

560
00:29:29,000 --> 00:29:32,000
I love Halloween more than anything.

561
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:36,000
The only time of the year where you are allowed to be a freak show.

562
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:41,000
And like nobody is to cares or gets mad.

563
00:29:41,000 --> 00:29:45,000
Think of any other night the entire year where you are allowed

564
00:29:45,000 --> 00:29:52,000
to hang out your car window as the Joker and scream and laugh at random like old people

565
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:53,000
on the street.

566
00:29:53,000 --> 00:29:56,000
When can you do that and people just go, oh, he's just being fun.

567
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:06,000
There's not a, not another time in the world where you could do that.

568
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:14,000
Oh, you're going to curve your bullets too, huh?

569
00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:18,000
Curve the bullets.

570
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:19,000
Angerly to jelly.

571
00:30:21,000 --> 00:30:24,000
That's every day for me, mad killer.

572
00:30:29,000 --> 00:30:31,000
Oh, the dark night premiere.

573
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:39,000
I guess that is the situation where you couldn't do that.

574
00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:42,000
Oh, welcome to the dark night premiere.

575
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:46,000
Okay, like that's, you can be the Joker and like screaming people.

576
00:30:51,000 --> 00:30:52,000
That's awesome.

577
00:30:58,000 --> 00:31:01,000
Yeah, I kind of feel like an ice cream cone right now.

578
00:31:05,000 --> 00:31:08,000
I feel like a big ice cream cone.

579
00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:14,000
Oh, boy.

580
00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:16,000
These guys aren't that bad.

581
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:18,000
I can handle these guys.

582
00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:20,000
I can handle these two dudes.

583
00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:27,000
Oh, if you're wondering if someone was asking about Team Fortress and how come I'm not streaming it or anything.

584
00:31:27,000 --> 00:31:31,000
I'm still waiting for a fix.

585
00:31:31,000 --> 00:31:34,000
And I think there's a beta driver right now for the 670.

586
00:31:34,000 --> 00:31:36,000
Oh, the 600 series in general.

587
00:31:36,000 --> 00:31:38,000
I'm going to download that and try it.

588
00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:45,000
It's just I didn't want to spend like an hour or two troubleshooting when that was already like an hour late to the stream anyways.

589
00:31:45,000 --> 00:31:48,000
So next week we will see what happens with that.

590
00:31:50,000 --> 00:31:53,000
But for right now, Larry, Jr.

591
00:31:53,000 --> 00:31:55,000
You're dead.

592
00:31:55,000 --> 00:31:58,000
And you're not coming back as much as you want to.

593
00:31:58,000 --> 00:32:00,000
I'm sorry.

594
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:03,000
As much as you want to be in your like fruit punch pool.

595
00:32:09,000 --> 00:32:13,000
See, this is looking more and more like a clean run every single time.

596
00:32:17,000 --> 00:32:19,000
Let's go.

597
00:32:21,000 --> 00:32:24,000
Four hearts full.

598
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:28,000
I got no stamps on it to worry about.

599
00:32:31,000 --> 00:32:33,000
You need to die.

600
00:32:33,000 --> 00:32:36,000
Man, you are a persistent son of a...

601
00:32:37,000 --> 00:32:41,000
I can't hit that guy in the face and he just kept going like...

602
00:32:43,000 --> 00:32:46,000
I get out of my face, man.

603
00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:51,000
Get out of my face.

604
00:32:51,000 --> 00:32:53,000
Do I play MMOs?

605
00:32:53,000 --> 00:32:56,000
Absolute freaking loot.

606
00:32:56,000 --> 00:33:00,000
I played World of Warcraft for over six years.

607
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:04,000
I had multiple max level characters.

608
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:06,000
My main was Warlock.

609
00:33:06,000 --> 00:33:09,000
Well, actually, let me refresh that.

610
00:33:14,000 --> 00:33:16,000
Warrior.

611
00:33:16,000 --> 00:33:17,000
Then it was a priest.

612
00:33:17,000 --> 00:33:18,000
And then it was a Warlock.

613
00:33:18,000 --> 00:33:22,000
And my main was the Warlock for the most amount of time.

614
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:26,000
But I had a priest warrior Warlock druid.

615
00:33:26,000 --> 00:33:30,000
God, I had like everything in that game.

616
00:33:30,000 --> 00:33:33,000
But then they did a bunch of weird changes.

617
00:33:34,000 --> 00:33:37,000
And I don't know why.

618
00:33:37,000 --> 00:33:39,000
They did a lot of changes.

619
00:33:39,000 --> 00:33:41,000
Oh, it's lagging right now.

620
00:33:41,000 --> 00:33:45,000
Streams lagging? What's going on here?

621
00:33:45,000 --> 00:33:48,000
Are we good?

622
00:33:50,000 --> 00:33:53,000
I hope so.

623
00:33:53,000 --> 00:33:56,000
It just popped up like everybody was like...

624
00:33:56,000 --> 00:34:01,000
Like my stream is on fire right now.

625
00:34:02,000 --> 00:34:07,000
So apparently my stream is like inflames.

626
00:34:07,000 --> 00:34:10,000
Try refreshing it.

627
00:34:10,000 --> 00:34:12,000
Try refreshing it up.

628
00:34:12,000 --> 00:34:13,000
Let's see.

629
00:34:13,000 --> 00:34:14,000
Let's see just to make sure I...

630
00:34:14,000 --> 00:34:18,000
Because a lot of you guys were just saying that it was lagging.

631
00:34:18,000 --> 00:34:21,000
Let's take a look here.

632
00:34:21,000 --> 00:34:26,000
Look at my stream health to make sure it's okay.

633
00:34:27,000 --> 00:34:30,000
My event.

634
00:34:30,000 --> 00:34:33,000
Life control room.

635
00:34:39,000 --> 00:34:44,000
Because it'll tell you it'll be like, oh, your stream is lagging like crazy.

636
00:34:44,000 --> 00:34:50,000
Oh, it says it's okay.

637
00:34:50,000 --> 00:34:52,000
So it seems better now.

638
00:34:52,000 --> 00:34:55,000
Alright, that's good.

639
00:34:56,000 --> 00:34:58,000
That's a good thing.

640
00:34:58,000 --> 00:35:04,000
Alright, well, I apologize about that.

641
00:35:04,000 --> 00:35:07,000
Sorry.

642
00:35:07,000 --> 00:35:12,000
Somebody just like rolled over and like tripped over my stream court at YouTube somewhere.

643
00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:19,000
And they like to plug it back in real quick.

644
00:35:19,000 --> 00:35:22,000
Somebody was eating a sandwich and they just like tripped like,

645
00:35:22,000 --> 00:35:29,000
I'm not even ripped up my stream court.

646
00:35:29,000 --> 00:35:34,000
Oh, oh.

647
00:35:34,000 --> 00:35:40,000
Yeah, if you're still getting the lag trying to refresh, sometimes that fixes it.

648
00:35:40,000 --> 00:35:47,000
It shouldn't be happening to begin with though.

649
00:35:47,000 --> 00:35:52,000
My favorite superhero is...

650
00:35:52,000 --> 00:35:54,000
Ah, that is a tough question.

651
00:35:54,000 --> 00:35:57,000
Because there are a lot.

652
00:35:57,000 --> 00:36:04,000
There are a lot that I could say.

653
00:36:04,000 --> 00:36:11,000
Oh my god, this room is full of bugs.

654
00:36:11,000 --> 00:36:14,000
Man, I don't want to say like, oh, Batman.

655
00:36:14,000 --> 00:36:19,000
Because it really isn't Batman.

656
00:36:19,000 --> 00:36:23,000
Or Superman.

657
00:36:23,000 --> 00:36:26,000
What is his name?

658
00:36:26,000 --> 00:36:31,000
I should be able to answer this question in three seconds.

659
00:36:31,000 --> 00:36:35,000
I don't know why I can't answer this.

660
00:36:35,000 --> 00:36:37,000
Super hero, super hero.

661
00:36:37,000 --> 00:36:39,000
Deadpool, Deadpool, there you go.

662
00:36:39,000 --> 00:36:41,000
Probably Deadpool, Deadpool or Venom.

663
00:36:41,000 --> 00:36:44,000
I've been waiting a long time to say that.

664
00:36:44,000 --> 00:36:47,000
Oh, I need more coins.

665
00:36:47,000 --> 00:36:50,000
ASAP.

666
00:36:50,000 --> 00:36:54,000
I'm going to buy this bomb and try to blow up the secret room.

667
00:36:54,000 --> 00:36:56,000
See if it's right here.

668
00:36:56,000 --> 00:36:58,000
But Venom is just such a cool character.

669
00:36:58,000 --> 00:37:00,000
I love the way he is.

670
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:02,000
He's just... is Venom.

671
00:37:02,000 --> 00:37:04,000
No, that was the wrong place.

672
00:37:04,000 --> 00:37:05,000
It was up top.

673
00:37:05,000 --> 00:37:07,000
God, dude.

674
00:37:07,000 --> 00:37:09,000
Alright, whatever.

675
00:37:09,000 --> 00:37:13,000
Let's go.

676
00:37:13,000 --> 00:37:14,000
Gerdy.

677
00:37:14,000 --> 00:37:15,000
I actually like facing Gerdy.

678
00:37:15,000 --> 00:37:18,000
I can handle him.

679
00:37:18,000 --> 00:37:21,000
I can handle Gerdy.

680
00:37:21,000 --> 00:37:23,000
Gerdy, come on.

681
00:37:23,000 --> 00:37:24,000
DUDGE!

682
00:37:24,000 --> 00:37:26,000
Whoa, whoa, whoa, I did not dodge that right at all.

683
00:37:26,000 --> 00:37:29,000
There we go.

684
00:37:29,000 --> 00:37:33,000
Oh, you two like bubbles of puke.

685
00:37:33,000 --> 00:37:37,000
Gotta get rid of those bubbles of puke.

686
00:37:40,000 --> 00:37:46,000
I know, Deadpool, because the Deadpool comics, if you ever read them, he is insane.

687
00:37:46,000 --> 00:37:48,000
He breaks the fourth wall all the time.

688
00:37:48,000 --> 00:37:52,000
He'll just be like, hey, reader, if you want to like skip this part, go ahead and like go to page 14.

689
00:37:52,000 --> 00:37:54,000
This part's like pretty boring.

690
00:37:54,000 --> 00:37:57,000
I just talked to some broad for like five minutes.

691
00:37:57,000 --> 00:37:59,000
I love how much he breaks the fourth wall.

692
00:37:59,000 --> 00:38:01,000
And the Deadpool comics.

693
00:38:01,000 --> 00:38:04,000
It's so funny.

694
00:38:04,000 --> 00:38:06,000
Alright, Gerdy.

695
00:38:06,000 --> 00:38:09,000
That just about enough of you.

696
00:38:09,000 --> 00:38:11,000
And you like big, smelly body.

697
00:38:11,000 --> 00:38:12,000
Oh, come on.

698
00:38:12,000 --> 00:38:17,000
You're gonna do me like that, Gerdy.

699
00:38:17,000 --> 00:38:25,000
I keep thinking that eye is not mine, and that happens every time.

700
00:38:25,000 --> 00:38:26,000
You would again.

701
00:38:26,000 --> 00:38:27,000
I'm not doing it again.

702
00:38:27,000 --> 00:38:28,000
I dare you.

703
00:38:28,000 --> 00:38:29,000
I dare you.

704
00:38:29,000 --> 00:38:31,000
Oh, you messed.

705
00:38:31,000 --> 00:38:35,000
You stupid.

706
00:38:35,000 --> 00:38:38,000
Go.

707
00:38:38,000 --> 00:38:40,000
The caves.

708
00:38:40,000 --> 00:38:43,000
Welcome to the caves.

709
00:38:43,000 --> 00:38:48,000
Down here, you'll never see the light of day again.

710
00:38:48,000 --> 00:38:56,000
And you almost die from fucking into things.

711
00:38:56,000 --> 00:39:04,000
What you know, Isaac.

712
00:39:04,000 --> 00:39:10,000
I actually, when Vindictus first came out, I was, it's free to play, right?

713
00:39:10,000 --> 00:39:15,000
I actually was going to download that, and I just forgot to do it.

714
00:39:15,000 --> 00:39:19,000
So thank you for reminding me, because I'm going to go download Vindictus

715
00:39:19,000 --> 00:39:22,000
like right after the stream is done.

716
00:39:22,000 --> 00:39:26,000
That's the one where it's like an MMO, but it's like a hack and slash kind of, like third person.

717
00:39:26,000 --> 00:39:30,000
That's the right game, I think it is, right?

718
00:39:30,000 --> 00:39:31,000
I'll take that money.

719
00:39:31,000 --> 00:39:32,000
Go ahead, blow up.

720
00:39:32,000 --> 00:39:39,000
I'll take that money.

721
00:39:39,000 --> 00:39:41,000
What's going here?

722
00:39:41,000 --> 00:39:43,000
Now, what do you have for me?

723
00:39:43,000 --> 00:39:48,000
If you don't have, if I don't win this in the first time, you are dying just to let you know.

724
00:39:48,000 --> 00:39:51,000
All right, I know you heard me.

725
00:39:51,000 --> 00:39:52,000
Do you want to stay alive?

726
00:39:52,000 --> 00:39:53,000
We'll find out.

727
00:39:53,000 --> 00:39:56,000
Oh, looks like somebody wants to get blown up.

728
00:39:56,000 --> 00:39:58,000
No, please, no, please, no.

729
00:39:58,000 --> 00:40:03,000
Yeah, couldn't even finish his sentence.

730
00:40:03,000 --> 00:40:07,000
And that's enough of that.

731
00:40:07,000 --> 00:40:12,000
Ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding.

732
00:40:12,000 --> 00:40:17,000
Yeah, definitely downloading Vindictus at the end of this stream.

733
00:40:17,000 --> 00:40:19,000
And I'm going to play it.

734
00:40:19,000 --> 00:40:24,000
A bunch.

735
00:40:24,000 --> 00:40:27,000
Aw, you turned into like a little piece of jello.

736
00:40:27,000 --> 00:40:30,000
I feel bad for you.

737
00:40:30,000 --> 00:40:33,000
Doing it.

738
00:40:33,000 --> 00:40:38,000
No, it wasn't worth it for like the seventh time in a row.

739
00:40:38,000 --> 00:40:46,000
It's never worth it.

740
00:40:46,000 --> 00:40:51,000
Me and MLC stealth played DC Universe for a little while.

741
00:40:51,000 --> 00:40:54,000
We play for like a few hours at least.

742
00:40:54,000 --> 00:40:56,000
I'm cracking my back.

743
00:40:56,000 --> 00:41:03,000
Hours at least.

744
00:41:03,000 --> 00:41:05,000
Of course it's great.

745
00:41:05,000 --> 00:41:08,000
Of course it's great.

746
00:41:08,000 --> 00:41:13,000
Why would it be anybody else besides greed?

747
00:41:13,000 --> 00:41:15,000
Get him eyeball.

748
00:41:15,000 --> 00:41:17,000
Shum.

749
00:41:17,000 --> 00:41:20,000
That.

750
00:41:20,000 --> 00:41:25,000
I'm shooting a red tear every other tear.

751
00:41:25,000 --> 00:41:28,000
Is that because my eye came out?

752
00:41:28,000 --> 00:41:32,000
Yeah, it has to be, right?

753
00:41:32,000 --> 00:41:34,000
Ah, green.

754
00:41:34,000 --> 00:41:38,000
You bastard.

755
00:41:38,000 --> 00:41:40,000
Why don't you go bottle like Edward Alrich?

756
00:41:40,000 --> 00:41:42,000
Like leave me alone.

757
00:41:42,000 --> 00:41:43,000
Never mind.

758
00:41:43,000 --> 00:41:44,000
You dropped a lot of money.

759
00:41:44,000 --> 00:41:49,000
I like you now.

760
00:41:50,000 --> 00:41:52,000
What am I doing standing there?

761
00:41:52,000 --> 00:41:54,000
I need to be in the corner.

762
00:41:54,000 --> 00:42:00,000
I need to be in the review.

763
00:42:00,000 --> 00:42:02,000
There we go.

764
00:42:02,000 --> 00:42:05,000
Don't even need to do that.

765
00:42:05,000 --> 00:42:07,000
Uh-oh, it's super toothless joke.

766
00:42:07,000 --> 00:42:12,000
Whatever his name is.

767
00:42:12,000 --> 00:42:14,000
These guys freak me out.

768
00:42:14,000 --> 00:42:18,000
These guys are scary.

769
00:42:18,000 --> 00:42:24,000
I've had all the Warhammer games for a pretty long time.

770
00:42:24,000 --> 00:42:32,000
If you are a fan of RTS, I would highly recommend you get the original dawn of war.

771
00:42:32,000 --> 00:42:34,000
I wasn't a fan of Dona War 2.

772
00:42:34,000 --> 00:42:36,000
I'm not gonna lie.

773
00:42:36,000 --> 00:42:44,000
I thought Dona War 2 was a good game, but I don't think it was nearly as good as Dona War 1.

774
00:42:44,000 --> 00:42:47,000
It's quite follow me, dude.

775
00:42:47,000 --> 00:42:49,000
Come on, come right here.

776
00:42:49,000 --> 00:42:50,000
Come on.

777
00:42:50,000 --> 00:42:51,000
Come on.

778
00:42:51,000 --> 00:42:54,000
I've got like candy and soda and chips.

779
00:42:54,000 --> 00:42:55,000
You know what?

780
00:42:55,000 --> 00:42:58,000
You're not gonna come down, so I'm just gonna kill you.

781
00:42:58,000 --> 00:43:02,000
We're gonna have a party down there, but you like didn't feel like come.

782
00:43:02,000 --> 00:43:09,000
That makes me sad.

783
00:43:10,000 --> 00:43:12,000
How much for?

784
00:43:12,000 --> 00:43:15,000
There we go.

785
00:43:15,000 --> 00:43:17,000
Item room is all the way over there.

786
00:43:17,000 --> 00:43:19,000
After this, I'm gonna have to go do that.

787
00:43:19,000 --> 00:43:21,000
Get to the item room.

788
00:43:21,000 --> 00:43:25,000
After all these toothless freaks.

789
00:43:25,000 --> 00:43:29,000
There we go.

790
00:43:29,000 --> 00:43:32,000
Oh!

791
00:43:32,000 --> 00:43:35,000
Speaking of Leopard 2, someone just said Leopard 2.

792
00:43:35,000 --> 00:43:42,000
Can they come out with a new map, Cold Stream, or Cold Land or something?

793
00:43:42,000 --> 00:43:47,000
Whatever it is, I'm definitely gonna be playing a lot of that too.

794
00:43:47,000 --> 00:43:48,000
Fork.

795
00:43:48,000 --> 00:43:50,000
Isaac's Fork.

796
00:43:50,000 --> 00:43:57,000
Okay.

797
00:43:57,000 --> 00:44:04,000
Oh, if you're gonna come to the potty, you're gonna bring like Salsa, you're gonna bring Dip, Chips, Soda, Pfft.

798
00:44:05,000 --> 00:44:15,000
Berger Patties, Frozen Hawk Dogs, a love for life, and a good attitude.

799
00:44:15,000 --> 00:44:25,000
That's the only way you're allowed in my potty.

800
00:44:25,000 --> 00:44:29,000
You sack of mobiles to get out of here.

801
00:44:29,000 --> 00:44:31,000
Open.

802
00:44:31,000 --> 00:44:32,000
Open.

803
00:44:33,000 --> 00:44:34,000
Now open again.

804
00:44:34,000 --> 00:44:35,000
I'm the dentist.

805
00:44:35,000 --> 00:44:39,000
And your teeth need a real cleaning.

806
00:44:39,000 --> 00:44:42,000
Pfft.

807
00:44:42,000 --> 00:44:45,000
Where's this item room?

808
00:44:45,000 --> 00:44:47,000
God.

809
00:44:47,000 --> 00:44:53,000
Such a big level is this DUMB.

810
00:44:53,000 --> 00:44:56,000
Oh my goodness, I need to damage up something.

811
00:44:56,000 --> 00:44:59,000
Because it's taking forever to kill any of these things.

812
00:44:59,000 --> 00:45:00,000
Open.

813
00:45:00,000 --> 00:45:07,000
Yeah, once it comes out, I'll stream left for that too.

814
00:45:07,000 --> 00:45:09,000
Once the new map comes out.

815
00:45:09,000 --> 00:45:10,000
Open.

816
00:45:10,000 --> 00:45:13,000
Come on.

817
00:45:13,000 --> 00:45:15,000
I didn't even kill him.

818
00:45:15,000 --> 00:45:17,000
My little buddy did.

819
00:45:17,000 --> 00:45:21,000
Ooh, little Chad.

820
00:45:21,000 --> 00:45:24,000
He's so happy.

821
00:45:24,000 --> 00:45:26,000
Hi, I'm bro Chad.

822
00:45:26,000 --> 00:45:28,000
I'm gonna drop hot for you.

823
00:45:29,000 --> 00:45:30,000
Thanks, little Chad.

824
00:45:30,000 --> 00:45:32,000
Don't know, problem.

825
00:45:32,000 --> 00:45:33,000
It's a little Chad.

826
00:45:33,000 --> 00:45:35,000
You're gonna tell me your life story.

827
00:45:35,000 --> 00:45:36,000
Good day, sir.

828
00:45:36,000 --> 00:45:40,000
I grew up in dishever, and then I pulled out hot.

829
00:45:40,000 --> 00:45:42,000
That's a touching story, Chad.

830
00:45:42,000 --> 00:45:43,000
Thank you.

831
00:45:43,000 --> 00:45:45,000
Now, give me your hearts before I kill myself,

832
00:45:45,000 --> 00:45:47,000
because I'm pretending to be two people.

833
00:45:47,000 --> 00:45:49,000
Okay.

834
00:45:49,000 --> 00:45:51,000
Well, that's a good way to lose three hearts.

835
00:45:51,000 --> 00:45:55,000
Do it like a little Chad movie.

836
00:45:59,000 --> 00:46:02,000
Pills here.

837
00:46:02,000 --> 00:46:04,000
No, no, that's the worst.

838
00:46:04,000 --> 00:46:07,000
That's the last thing I wanted.

839
00:46:10,000 --> 00:46:11,000
Yeah, I got it.

840
00:46:11,000 --> 00:46:14,000
There is a circus following me right now.

841
00:46:14,000 --> 00:46:15,000
Look at this.

842
00:46:15,000 --> 00:46:17,000
Like,

843
00:46:17,000 --> 00:46:23,000
all I need now is brother Bobby,

844
00:46:23,000 --> 00:46:26,000
and like more tack flies,

845
00:46:26,000 --> 00:46:28,000
I'll be all set.

846
00:46:32,000 --> 00:46:35,000
Hopefully I don't die.

847
00:46:35,000 --> 00:46:37,000
Oh, Chad.

848
00:46:37,000 --> 00:46:40,000
Oh, no.

849
00:46:40,000 --> 00:46:42,000
Why is he so weak?

850
00:46:42,000 --> 00:46:44,000
Was that my...

851
00:46:44,000 --> 00:46:46,000
What just even hurt him?

852
00:46:46,000 --> 00:46:49,000
I didn't do that.

853
00:46:49,000 --> 00:46:52,000
Hopefully he doesn't kill me.

854
00:46:52,000 --> 00:46:54,000
All right, little Chad and Big Chad.

855
00:46:54,000 --> 00:46:57,000
This is like very surreal.

856
00:46:57,000 --> 00:46:59,000
He's fighting his like daddy right now.

857
00:46:59,000 --> 00:47:01,000
This is like weird.

858
00:47:01,000 --> 00:47:05,000
Who side of you on, son?

859
00:47:05,000 --> 00:47:11,000
I stand on the side of light.

860
00:47:11,000 --> 00:47:14,000
What's in here?

861
00:47:14,000 --> 00:47:18,000
I'm actually kind of tempted to take this,

862
00:47:18,000 --> 00:47:21,000
because I could use the spirit hearts.

863
00:47:21,000 --> 00:47:24,000
I think I'm going to take that.

864
00:47:24,000 --> 00:47:27,000
I really think I'm going to take this right now.

865
00:47:27,000 --> 00:47:29,000
Oh, I'm going to take it.

866
00:47:29,000 --> 00:47:30,000
I'm going to take it.

867
00:47:30,000 --> 00:47:32,000
I took it.

868
00:47:32,000 --> 00:47:34,000
Thank you.

869
00:47:34,000 --> 00:47:40,000
It was a decision I had to make, and I made it.

870
00:47:40,000 --> 00:47:41,000
I needed it.

871
00:47:41,000 --> 00:47:42,000
Oh, God.

872
00:47:42,000 --> 00:47:44,000
I'm like, why is it crashing?

873
00:47:44,000 --> 00:47:45,000
What?

874
00:47:45,000 --> 00:47:46,000
What?

875
00:47:46,000 --> 00:47:48,000
Oh.

876
00:47:48,000 --> 00:47:51,000
For a second there, I thought the game was just crashed and done.

877
00:47:51,000 --> 00:47:53,000
I was just about to freak out.

878
00:47:53,000 --> 00:47:55,000
Did my stream die?

879
00:47:55,000 --> 00:47:57,000
You're still streaming, right?

880
00:47:57,000 --> 00:47:59,000
Okay, you guys saw that.

881
00:47:59,000 --> 00:48:02,000
It was just like...

882
00:48:06,000 --> 00:48:08,000
You know what?

883
00:48:08,000 --> 00:48:13,000
We might even do it again at some point if I need it.

884
00:48:14,000 --> 00:48:19,000
Oh, pro dodges right there.

885
00:48:19,000 --> 00:48:22,000
Pro dodging.

886
00:48:22,000 --> 00:48:28,000
I wish there wasn't all these obstacles in the way, so I could hit them.

887
00:48:28,000 --> 00:48:32,000
Oh, that thing was blocking it.

888
00:48:32,000 --> 00:48:37,000
That was why.

889
00:48:37,000 --> 00:48:39,000
Give me that.

890
00:48:39,000 --> 00:48:44,000
And I'm going to blow this up for sure.

891
00:48:44,000 --> 00:48:45,000
Good position.

892
00:48:45,000 --> 00:48:48,000
Now, too bad I have stupid curse of the labyrinth.

893
00:48:48,000 --> 00:48:51,000
Whatever this dumb thing does.

894
00:48:51,000 --> 00:48:55,000
Makes it so I can't see anything.

895
00:48:55,000 --> 00:48:58,000
Oh, I want to kill at least Mom.

896
00:48:58,000 --> 00:49:00,000
I want to kill Mom.

897
00:49:00,000 --> 00:49:04,000
That big fat...

898
00:49:04,000 --> 00:49:05,000
Oh.

899
00:49:05,000 --> 00:49:07,000
There we go.

900
00:49:07,000 --> 00:49:10,000
Let's go down.

901
00:49:10,000 --> 00:49:12,000
I just did this room, man.

902
00:49:12,000 --> 00:49:16,000
I just did this room.

903
00:49:16,000 --> 00:49:19,000
Okay, I'm going the other way.

904
00:49:19,000 --> 00:49:22,000
I'm going around.

905
00:49:22,000 --> 00:49:25,000
Ah.

906
00:49:25,000 --> 00:49:32,000
There's too much stuff blocking you for me to shoot you.

907
00:49:32,000 --> 00:49:36,000
See, if I didn't take that guppies hand, I didn't use it.

908
00:49:36,000 --> 00:49:39,000
I probably would be dead right now.

909
00:49:39,000 --> 00:49:45,000
Because I've been hit at least five or six times.

910
00:49:45,000 --> 00:49:48,000
Oh, this is bad.

911
00:49:48,000 --> 00:49:52,000
Oh, this is really bad, especially this room.

912
00:49:52,000 --> 00:49:54,000
Don't spawn anymore.

913
00:49:54,000 --> 00:49:56,000
No, no, get...

914
00:49:56,000 --> 00:49:57,000
God.

915
00:49:57,000 --> 00:50:00,000
I hate spiders.

916
00:50:00,000 --> 00:50:05,000
Not only in real life, but in fake life, too.

917
00:50:05,000 --> 00:50:10,000
That's a good thing to take.

918
00:50:10,000 --> 00:50:19,000
Gappy.

919
00:50:19,000 --> 00:50:21,000
Die.

920
00:50:21,000 --> 00:50:23,000
Oh, you hairy...

921
00:50:23,000 --> 00:50:24,000
No, this is going to be so...

922
00:50:24,000 --> 00:50:27,000
I was going to stay in the corner.

923
00:50:27,000 --> 00:50:33,000
No sense going out there and meeting my demise like that.

924
00:50:33,000 --> 00:50:35,000
Get out of here.

925
00:50:35,000 --> 00:50:42,000
Oh, no, corner's bad move.

926
00:50:42,000 --> 00:50:46,000
There has to be this many things in this room.

927
00:50:46,000 --> 00:50:53,000
Get out of here, you bum-bomb.

928
00:50:53,000 --> 00:50:57,000
There's so many of these little guys that shoot.

929
00:50:57,000 --> 00:51:00,000
I hate those ones.

930
00:51:00,000 --> 00:51:02,000
I actually just tried to Samson Run.

931
00:51:02,000 --> 00:51:04,000
Didn't really work out too well.

932
00:51:04,000 --> 00:51:08,000
I got to like...

933
00:51:08,000 --> 00:51:12,000
What, the third or fourth Roman I died?

934
00:51:12,000 --> 00:51:18,000
Oh, come on.

935
00:51:18,000 --> 00:51:20,000
I don't want any of your like cream cheese.

936
00:51:20,000 --> 00:51:27,000
Get out of here.

937
00:51:27,000 --> 00:51:32,000
This is the binding of Isaac, Wrath of the Lamb, DLC.

938
00:51:32,000 --> 00:51:35,000
And this is me getting stuck and not being able to...

939
00:51:35,000 --> 00:51:37,000
Oh, my God.

940
00:51:37,000 --> 00:51:39,000
I had to do that.

941
00:51:39,000 --> 00:51:40,000
You guys all saw it.

942
00:51:40,000 --> 00:51:41,000
I had to do that.

943
00:51:41,000 --> 00:51:43,000
I might even have to do it again.

944
00:51:43,000 --> 00:51:45,000
I'm going to have to do it again.

945
00:51:45,000 --> 00:51:51,000
I'm probably going to have to do it again.

946
00:51:51,000 --> 00:51:52,000
Oh, my God.

947
00:51:52,000 --> 00:51:54,000
I'm going to have to do it again.

948
00:51:54,000 --> 00:51:57,000
Oh, my God, no.

949
00:51:57,000 --> 00:52:02,000
There's no way for me to go.

950
00:52:02,000 --> 00:52:10,000
Oh, there was no way for me to go.

951
00:52:10,000 --> 00:52:15,000
Oh, my God.

952
00:52:15,000 --> 00:52:18,000
There was literally nothing I could do right there,

953
00:52:18,000 --> 00:52:22,000
besides just get hit a million times.

954
00:52:23,000 --> 00:52:28,000
Oh, now it is definitely over.

955
00:52:28,000 --> 00:52:30,000
Oh, these...

956
00:52:30,000 --> 00:52:33,000
Come on.

957
00:52:33,000 --> 00:52:35,000
Okay, well, that's going to be the end of this run.

958
00:52:35,000 --> 00:52:37,000
I hope you enjoyed this.

959
00:52:37,000 --> 00:52:39,000
Have fun and whatever you're going to do.

960
00:52:39,000 --> 00:52:44,000
And then however you put path you take in your life.

961
00:52:52,000 --> 00:52:54,000
I'm silent.

962
00:52:54,000 --> 00:52:57,000
God.

963
00:52:57,000 --> 00:53:03,000
Oh, that was the worst possible thing that could happen.

964
00:53:03,000 --> 00:53:07,000
No order on, no order hide.

965
00:53:07,000 --> 00:53:10,000
No order go.

966
00:53:10,000 --> 00:53:12,000
They were like...

967
00:53:12,000 --> 00:53:16,000
engulfing me.

968
00:53:16,000 --> 00:53:23,000
Oh, gosh, darn it.

969
00:53:23,000 --> 00:53:34,000
Well, that's...

970
00:53:34,000 --> 00:53:39,000
So now you know what's going to happen.

971
00:53:39,000 --> 00:53:42,000
Is grandpa is going to play his question mark, question mark, question mark.

972
00:53:42,000 --> 00:53:45,000
And that's going to be the end of the stream.

973
00:53:45,000 --> 00:53:46,000
So I'm going to go get grandpa.

974
00:53:46,000 --> 00:53:48,000
Grandpa can come in and he'll sit down.

975
00:53:48,000 --> 00:53:52,000
He'll talk about how he loves this game.

976
00:53:52,000 --> 00:53:54,000
And we'll see what happens.

977
00:53:54,000 --> 00:53:56,000
Hey, grandpa!

978
00:53:56,000 --> 00:53:57,000
Hey, you got to get down here.

979
00:53:57,000 --> 00:54:01,000
You got to play binding of Isaac right now.

980
00:54:01,000 --> 00:54:03,000
No, come get it.

981
00:54:03,000 --> 00:54:04,000
Yeah, come down.

982
00:54:04,000 --> 00:54:05,000
You're scaring the dog.

983
00:54:05,000 --> 00:54:07,000
Just come down.

984
00:54:07,000 --> 00:54:09,000
Okay, let me just get it over here.

985
00:54:09,000 --> 00:54:11,000
What the hell is this game?

986
00:54:11,000 --> 00:54:12,000
What game is this?

987
00:54:12,000 --> 00:54:14,000
Binding of Isaac.

988
00:54:14,000 --> 00:54:15,000
What is that?

989
00:54:15,000 --> 00:54:16,000
Just play it.

990
00:54:16,000 --> 00:54:17,000
Just sit down and play.

991
00:54:17,000 --> 00:54:18,000
Okay, I'll sit down.

992
00:54:18,000 --> 00:54:20,000
Ready, there we go.

993
00:54:20,000 --> 00:54:21,000
Okay, hello!

994
00:54:21,000 --> 00:54:25,000
Let's play the binding of Isaac.

995
00:54:25,000 --> 00:54:26,000
What is it?

996
00:54:26,000 --> 00:54:28,000
Did I just eat shit?

997
00:54:28,000 --> 00:54:30,000
What the hell was that?

998
00:54:30,000 --> 00:54:35,000
No, it's all under control of this game.

999
00:54:35,000 --> 00:54:38,000
Up, down, left, right.

1000
00:54:38,000 --> 00:54:40,000
Okay, so here we go.

1001
00:54:40,000 --> 00:54:42,000
Up, down, left, right.

1002
00:54:42,000 --> 00:54:44,000
Okay, good.

1003
00:54:44,000 --> 00:54:46,000
Let's go this way.

1004
00:54:46,000 --> 00:54:48,000
What is it?

1005
00:54:48,000 --> 00:54:49,000
Ha ha ha!

1006
00:54:49,000 --> 00:54:50,000
That's a spider.

1007
00:54:50,000 --> 00:54:52,000
This game is stupid.

1008
00:54:52,000 --> 00:54:54,000
What a dumb game.

1009
00:54:54,000 --> 00:54:57,000
So you want to just kill spiders and that's it.

1010
00:54:57,000 --> 00:54:59,000
This is stupid.

1011
00:54:59,000 --> 00:55:01,000
Why would you ever play this game?

1012
00:55:01,000 --> 00:55:03,000
Okay, let's keep going.

1013
00:55:03,000 --> 00:55:05,000
What's that?

1014
00:55:05,000 --> 00:55:06,000
What the hell?

1015
00:55:06,000 --> 00:55:09,000
Oh, that hurts you.

1016
00:55:09,000 --> 00:55:11,000
Ha ha!

1017
00:55:11,000 --> 00:55:13,000
Oh, am I going to die?

1018
00:55:13,000 --> 00:55:14,000
Let's just go.

1019
00:55:14,000 --> 00:55:17,000
Okay, I'm going to beat this entire game right now.

1020
00:55:17,000 --> 00:55:19,000
Let's go, let's go down.

1021
00:55:19,000 --> 00:55:21,000
Okay, we're going to go down here.

1022
00:55:21,000 --> 00:55:24,000
Look, look, I'm driving like a farm right here.

1023
00:55:24,000 --> 00:55:26,000
A pet spider is okay.

1024
00:55:26,000 --> 00:55:27,000
Hey, spiders.

1025
00:55:27,000 --> 00:55:32,000
So today I'm going to feed you some little bugs that you're going to eat them.

1026
00:55:32,000 --> 00:55:35,000
Okay, shoot that.

1027
00:55:35,000 --> 00:55:37,000
So how do I...

1028
00:55:37,000 --> 00:55:38,000
It looks like a simulator.

1029
00:55:38,000 --> 00:55:40,000
How do I get out of here?

1030
00:55:40,000 --> 00:55:41,000
Well, whatever, escape.

1031
00:55:41,000 --> 00:55:42,000
One of the bugs escaped.

1032
00:55:42,000 --> 00:55:45,000
One of the bugs, fucking escaped.

1033
00:55:45,000 --> 00:55:48,000
That means you died, by the way.

1034
00:55:48,000 --> 00:55:50,000
If you escaped a hole, that means you died.

1035
00:55:50,000 --> 00:55:52,000
You bastard.

1036
00:55:52,000 --> 00:55:56,000
See, these guys are locked in here forever.

1037
00:55:56,000 --> 00:55:58,000
Can you get out of here?

1038
00:55:58,000 --> 00:56:01,000
How about trying to get down?

1039
00:56:01,000 --> 00:56:02,000
You're not getting anywhere.

1040
00:56:02,000 --> 00:56:04,000
I'm going to shoot that giant out of you.

1041
00:56:04,000 --> 00:56:06,000
You can't even do it.

1042
00:56:06,000 --> 00:56:07,000
That's it.

1043
00:56:07,000 --> 00:56:08,000
I got the key.

1044
00:56:08,000 --> 00:56:14,000
I'm going to go in the golden room, the golden palace, and pick up the lazy beam.

1045
00:56:14,000 --> 00:56:15,000
What?

1046
00:56:15,000 --> 00:56:17,000
What is this deal?

1047
00:56:17,000 --> 00:56:21,000
Is this a shoot right to a people?

1048
00:56:21,000 --> 00:56:24,000
So what's this practice deal?

1049
00:56:24,000 --> 00:56:27,000
Oh, yeah, yeah.

1050
00:56:27,000 --> 00:56:28,000
Ew.

1051
00:56:28,000 --> 00:56:31,000
This game is gross.

1052
00:56:31,000 --> 00:56:33,000
No, I take money.

1053
00:56:33,000 --> 00:56:35,000
I love the money.

1054
00:56:36,000 --> 00:56:37,000
I absolutely love money.

1055
00:56:37,000 --> 00:56:39,000
It's the best thing in the world.

1056
00:56:39,000 --> 00:56:42,000
Whoa, that was an explosion.

1057
00:56:42,000 --> 00:56:45,000
We're going down to this room.

1058
00:56:45,000 --> 00:56:47,000
Okay.

1059
00:56:47,000 --> 00:56:49,000
Did I miss anything?

1060
00:56:49,000 --> 00:56:50,000
Do I have to go back up here?

1061
00:56:50,000 --> 00:56:51,000
Or something?

1062
00:56:51,000 --> 00:56:53,000
What the hell is this?

1063
00:56:53,000 --> 00:56:54,000
What is this?

1064
00:56:54,000 --> 00:56:55,000
Do I go in this?

1065
00:56:55,000 --> 00:56:57,000
Oh my god, this guy's...

1066
00:56:57,000 --> 00:56:59,000
What is this guy?

1067
00:56:59,000 --> 00:57:00,000
Can I help?

1068
00:57:00,000 --> 00:57:01,000
I'm going to get him down.

1069
00:57:01,000 --> 00:57:02,000
I'm going to get him down off that rope.

1070
00:57:02,000 --> 00:57:04,000
He's going to die.

1071
00:57:04,000 --> 00:57:05,000
Oh, whatever.

1072
00:57:05,000 --> 00:57:06,000
Scroll you.

1073
00:57:06,000 --> 00:57:11,000
Let's scroll down here.

1074
00:57:11,000 --> 00:57:15,000
And this is the room I need to go in right now.

1075
00:57:15,000 --> 00:57:19,000
Oh, I have to fight this little worm.

1076
00:57:19,000 --> 00:57:22,000
So much, I just...

1077
00:57:22,000 --> 00:57:25,000
Okay, so how many lives do I get?

1078
00:57:25,000 --> 00:57:28,000
I get like ten lives, right?

1079
00:57:28,000 --> 00:57:31,000
Like two at least, two at three lives, right?

1080
00:57:32,000 --> 00:57:34,000
What is...

1081
00:57:35,000 --> 00:57:39,000
Where's the other stuff that's all over again?

1082
00:57:39,000 --> 00:57:42,000
You don't get lives, and you don't get lives in this game.

1083
00:57:42,000 --> 00:57:46,000
Is that what you're trying to tell me right now?

1084
00:57:46,000 --> 00:57:48,000
How can I don't have...

1085
00:57:48,000 --> 00:57:52,000
This is the stupidest game I've ever played!

1086
00:57:52,000 --> 00:57:53,000
How... why would...

1087
00:57:53,000 --> 00:57:54,000
This is the time...

1088
00:57:54,000 --> 00:57:55,000
You know what?

1089
00:57:55,000 --> 00:57:56,000
I'm not going to do anything.

1090
00:57:56,000 --> 00:57:58,000
I'm going right back to that same boss.

1091
00:57:58,000 --> 00:58:01,000
Got worms out of a bitch that's going down right now.

1092
00:58:01,000 --> 00:58:02,000
Hey, worm!

1093
00:58:02,000 --> 00:58:04,000
Is it...

1094
00:58:04,000 --> 00:58:07,000
Is it a different guy?

1095
00:58:07,000 --> 00:58:08,000
Is it different...

1096
00:58:08,000 --> 00:58:09,000
Why is it...

1097
00:58:09,000 --> 00:58:10,000
Where's the worm?

1098
00:58:10,000 --> 00:58:14,000
The worm looked a lot easier than this guy.

1099
00:58:14,000 --> 00:58:16,000
What is it?

1100
00:58:16,000 --> 00:58:18,000
Is this whole game just like randomly generated?

1101
00:58:18,000 --> 00:58:20,000
Is it stupid?

1102
00:58:20,000 --> 00:58:22,000
I'm going to like punch him in the face.

1103
00:58:22,000 --> 00:58:23,000
I'll punch you!

1104
00:58:23,000 --> 00:58:25,000
I'm going to punch you right in your face!

1105
00:58:25,000 --> 00:58:26,000
You see, that's how you're doing.

1106
00:58:26,000 --> 00:58:27,000
That's a pro tip right there.

1107
00:58:27,000 --> 00:58:29,000
See all those bugs that were around him?

1108
00:58:29,000 --> 00:58:30,000
They're not there anymore, aren't they?

1109
00:58:30,000 --> 00:58:31,000
See, I'll do it again!

1110
00:58:31,000 --> 00:58:32,000
Get rid of them!

1111
00:58:32,000 --> 00:58:33,000
Stupid goddamn bugs!

1112
00:58:33,000 --> 00:58:35,000
And that's how you win.

1113
00:58:35,000 --> 00:58:37,000
That's how you beat the shit in your pool on them too.

1114
00:58:37,000 --> 00:58:40,000
And that's how you get the most massive points.

1115
00:58:43,000 --> 00:58:44,000
Cartetrate.

1116
00:58:44,000 --> 00:58:46,000
Cartetrate!

1117
00:58:46,000 --> 00:58:48,000
Neat the Cartetrate!

1118
00:58:49,000 --> 00:58:50,000
Oh...

1119
00:58:50,000 --> 00:58:53,000
I don't have enough life to do in a bug move again.

1120
00:58:53,000 --> 00:58:56,000
I don't have enough life to do in a bug move.

1121
00:58:56,000 --> 00:58:58,000
And you know what? That's what he's not much dead.

1122
00:58:58,000 --> 00:59:00,000
I'm going to beat the game.

1123
00:59:00,000 --> 00:59:02,000
I just beat the game!

1124
00:59:02,000 --> 00:59:04,000
I just beat the game!

1125
00:59:04,000 --> 00:59:06,000
I just beat the game!

1126
00:59:06,000 --> 00:59:08,000
This game's supposed to be on.

1127
00:59:08,000 --> 00:59:09,000
Just...

1128
00:59:09,000 --> 00:59:11,000
Just...

1129
00:59:11,000 --> 00:59:13,000
We're doing it again.

1130
00:59:13,000 --> 00:59:15,000
We're going to do it again. Go!

1131
00:59:17,000 --> 00:59:19,000
Get out of my way!

1132
00:59:19,000 --> 00:59:21,000
Get out of my way!

1133
00:59:21,000 --> 00:59:23,000
Just get him a stick!

1134
00:59:23,000 --> 00:59:25,000
You know?

1135
00:59:26,000 --> 00:59:28,000
See you later!

1136
00:59:28,000 --> 00:59:32,000
If you play that game, you're at the start of a bitch in my opinion.

1137
00:59:32,000 --> 00:59:34,000
And we're not friends anymore.

1138
00:59:34,000 --> 00:59:36,000
So I'll get that in here.

1139
00:59:36,000 --> 00:59:38,000
Stop tucking you, you old guy.

1140
00:59:38,000 --> 00:59:39,000
Die, slide!

1141
00:59:42,000 --> 00:59:44,000
Hello?

1142
00:59:46,000 --> 00:59:48,000
You see, um...

1143
00:59:48,000 --> 00:59:50,000
Did he die?

1144
00:59:50,000 --> 00:59:52,000
What am I?

1145
00:59:53,000 --> 00:59:55,000
Oh, I'm going to put these headphones back in.

1146
00:59:57,000 --> 00:59:59,000
I mean, he still has a heart left.

1147
00:59:59,000 --> 01:00:02,000
It's not like he didn't die completely.

1148
01:00:03,000 --> 01:00:07,000
Why is he playing this guy, by the way?

1149
01:00:10,000 --> 01:00:12,000
All right.

1150
01:00:12,000 --> 01:00:14,000
Let's salvage the grandpa run.

1151
01:00:14,000 --> 01:00:16,000
It's going to be impossible!

1152
01:00:19,000 --> 01:00:21,000
Oh, poor grandpa.

1153
01:00:23,000 --> 01:00:25,000
Don't worry, he'll get over it.

1154
01:00:27,000 --> 01:00:30,000
Grandpa rages all the time.

1155
01:00:30,000 --> 01:00:32,000
He'll get over it.

1156
01:00:35,000 --> 01:00:37,000
Ten bombs.

1157
01:00:37,000 --> 01:00:40,000
And he died three times.

1158
01:00:42,000 --> 01:00:45,000
Make it four, because I'm probably not going to make it out of this room.

1159
01:00:45,000 --> 01:00:47,000
Nope.

1160
01:00:48,000 --> 01:00:50,000
Oh, there's no way.

1161
01:00:50,000 --> 01:00:51,000
There's no way.

1162
01:00:51,000 --> 01:00:53,000
Like, there's not a chance.

1163
01:00:57,000 --> 01:00:59,000
Hahaha.

1164
01:01:01,000 --> 01:01:05,000
Ding, ding, ding, ding, and that's the... right there.

1165
01:01:06,000 --> 01:01:09,000
Well, that's going to wrap it up, guys.

1166
01:01:12,000 --> 01:01:14,000
Thanks, everybody, so much for coming.

1167
01:01:14,000 --> 01:01:17,000
This will all be on YouTube in the next...

1168
01:01:17,000 --> 01:01:20,000
...like half an hour or so, so if you missed it from the beginning...

1169
01:01:20,000 --> 01:01:22,000
...didn't really do any good runs.

1170
01:01:22,000 --> 01:01:25,000
Unfortunately, it wasn't a good night for Isaac.

1171
01:01:26,000 --> 01:01:27,000
So...

1172
01:01:27,000 --> 01:01:29,000
But that's okay, head phone, regardless.

1173
01:01:29,000 --> 01:01:31,000
So thanks, everybody, again, for coming so much.

1174
01:01:31,000 --> 01:01:33,000
You guys all rock and roll.

1175
01:01:33,000 --> 01:01:36,000
And I will see you guys all soon.

1176
01:01:36,000 --> 01:01:38,000
So take care, everybody.

1177
01:01:38,000 --> 01:01:41,000
And let's... end this dream.

1178
01:01:44,000 --> 01:01:47,000
Oh, and grandpa just says goodbye, too, and then he loves you all.

1179
01:01:47,000 --> 01:01:49,000
Right, grandpa?

1180
01:01:49,000 --> 01:01:51,000
Oh, and he's coming in here, hold on.

1181
01:01:51,000 --> 01:01:52,000
Grandpa, get in here.

1182
01:01:52,000 --> 01:01:54,000
You need to apologize to these people.

1183
01:01:57,000 --> 01:01:59,000
I apologize, daddy.

1184
01:02:00,000 --> 01:02:03,000
Okay, I'm sorry.

1185
01:02:03,000 --> 01:02:05,000
I'm really sorry, you know.

1186
01:02:05,000 --> 01:02:07,000
Rage takes over us all.

1187
01:02:07,000 --> 01:02:10,000
And the game was just a little too hard.

1188
01:02:10,000 --> 01:02:12,000
But I love everybody.

1189
01:02:12,000 --> 01:02:15,000
I hope you guys have a fantastic Sunday...

1190
01:02:15,000 --> 01:02:16,000
...and...

1191
01:02:16,000 --> 01:02:19,000
...gloved grandpa.

1192
01:02:19,000 --> 01:02:20,000
And goodbye.

1193
01:02:20,000 --> 01:02:22,000
That's it, goodbye.

1194
01:02:23,000 --> 01:02:25,000
Now we're gonna eat in my 10 minutes.

1195
01:02:25,000 --> 01:02:26,000
You gotta have a page, Adam.

1196
01:02:26,000 --> 01:02:28,000
Adam, let's go.

1197
01:02:28,000 --> 01:02:29,000
I bring you dog, too.

1198
01:02:29,000 --> 01:02:31,000
I'm gonna feed her.

1199
01:02:32,000 --> 01:02:34,000
All right, see you later.

1200
01:02:36,000 --> 01:02:38,000
So that's gonna be the end, guys.

1201
01:02:38,000 --> 01:02:39,000
Thanks a lot for watching.

1202
01:02:39,000 --> 01:02:40,000
I really do appreciate it.

1203
01:02:40,000 --> 01:02:42,000
And of course, again, take care.

1204
01:02:42,000 --> 01:02:43,000
Everybody.

1205
01:02:52,000 --> 01:02:53,000
Thank you.
