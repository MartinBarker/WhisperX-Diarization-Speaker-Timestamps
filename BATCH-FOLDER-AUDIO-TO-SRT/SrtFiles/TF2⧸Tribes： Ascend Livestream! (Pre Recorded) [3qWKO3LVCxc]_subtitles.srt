1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
Duh, duh, duh, duh, duh, duh.

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:05,000
Duh, duh, duh, duh, duh, duh.

3
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:07,000
Oh, I can hear myself.

4
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:09,000
Gotta change that.

5
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:10,000
I can hear myself.

6
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:14,000
It's going on, guys.

7
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:22,000
How's your Saturday going?

8
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:26,000
Or potentially Sunday if you're from a different country.

9
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:32,000
I'll save that for a second here.

10
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:36,000
Okay, okay.

11
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:44,000
This is a little smaller on the right already.

12
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:47,000
So I'm trying something a little different.

13
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:50,000
I am trying a...

14
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:55,000
I bought X-Flit, so I have X-Flit here and I'm trying a few things.

15
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:59,000
Doing the capture source, I'm not doing the screen region.

16
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:04,000
So it's probably going to be a little different or at least on your end it'll look the same.

17
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:09,000
On my end it's going to be a little bit different.

18
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:19,000
Alright.

19
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:21,000
Let me shout this out.

20
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:30,000
Twitter, I already have a pre-done, don't worry, it's all pre-done.

21
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:35,000
What is that?

22
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:40,000
And I can close that window.

23
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:43,000
I got to do the YouTube one.

24
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:45,000
Over the...

25
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:48,000
Heck, that is.

26
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:57,000
Trying something that I need.

27
00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:02,000
Post.

28
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:10,000
Okay, close that window.

29
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:20,000
And then I got this to do...

30
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:23,000
Alright.

31
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:33,000
We're in business.

32
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:37,000
We are in business.

33
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:39,000
Alright.

34
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:45,000
Let's get in here now.

35
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:49,000
So for those of you wondering, I'm going to...

36
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:52,000
This is going to be uploaded to YouTube after this.

37
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:58,000
Probably what I'm going to start doing until YouTube gets its act together.

38
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:02,000
Because the last time I streamed on YouTube, last couple times I streamed on YouTube,

39
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:03,000
it was...

40
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:04,000
Wasn't pretty.

41
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:06,000
There's a lot of problems, so...

42
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:09,000
Maybe I'll try doing YouTube next week or something like that.

43
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:13,000
I'm not sure, but this will be up on YouTube.

44
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:17,000
This whole thing.

45
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:23,000
Alright.

46
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:27,000
Refresh again, because I didn't check that.

47
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:29,000
Where from Massachusetts am I from?

48
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:32,000
I am from Boston.

49
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:35,000
I guess I'm not really from Boston.

50
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:43,000
I'm kind of from a suburb of Boston, but I'm close enough where I can say I'm from Boston, I guess.

51
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:46,000
Let's get a zero out of...

52
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:48,000
Try 24.

53
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:53,000
Any zero out of 32?

54
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:56,000
There's.

55
00:03:56,000 --> 00:04:00,000
Alright, how about this one?

56
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:06,000
Here's the IP.

57
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:08,000
I know what Reading is.

58
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:11,000
I have family members in Reading.

59
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:14,000
That's pretty cool.

60
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:16,000
Alright, the...

61
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:21,000
IP is going in the chat right now.

62
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:28,000
Make sure I get in there first, and there you go.

63
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:36,000
What's going on, guys?

64
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:38,000
Bad water basin.

65
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:51,000
Let's fill this server up, huh?

66
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:54,000
Come on, let's go.

67
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:57,000
I don't got a whole day.

68
00:04:57,000 --> 00:05:00,000
Oh my kid, and I got plenty of time.

69
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:03,000
I get all the time in the world.

70
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:08,000
That's not really that true, but...

71
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:12,000
Zero out of zero.

72
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:17,000
Where is everybody?

73
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:20,000
I'm the only person that gives a right server?

74
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:23,000
I think I did, didn't I?

75
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:26,000
I hope I did.

76
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:30,000
I hope I came to the right server.

77
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:33,000
Make sure I did.

78
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:35,000
This is the one, right?

79
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:38,000
Yeah, okay.

80
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:40,000
Copy.

81
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:44,000
Yeah, I'm going to put it in there again, just in case.

82
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:54,000
Just in case.

83
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:57,000
Alright, look at that.

84
00:05:57,000 --> 00:06:00,000
Looks like that was the right server.

85
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:03,000
Who's the hope so?

86
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:08,000
I'll let you one fire.

87
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:14,000
Okay, cool.

88
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:18,000
I like your hat.

89
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:22,000
First time in my stream, because you have six hours ahead.

90
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:24,000
It is late for you.

91
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:29,000
You are late, dweller.

92
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:30,000
Oh, that guy's lagging.

93
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:31,000
I don't want to kill him.

94
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:34,000
I feel bad.

95
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:41,000
That guy who's like slow-botion.

96
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:46,000
Got my lemonade over here on the left.

97
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:48,000
It has been really nice out.

98
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:51,000
I don't know what it's been like for you guys, wherever you live.

99
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:54,000
But my goodness, it has been so beautiful out here lately.

100
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:59,000
It's been 75 degrees, 80 degrees, every single day.

101
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:01,000
And I've been going outside a lot.

102
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:03,000
I've been taking my new dog from walks.

103
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:04,000
You know that, Dale.

104
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:06,000
Oh, actually, kill him.

105
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:09,000
Oh, that's a, that's why.

106
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:11,000
Oh, nice shot, dude.

107
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:15,000
Nice shoot and text.

108
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:22,000
Funny spots.

109
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:28,000
All right, let me go out here.

110
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:29,000
Yo, boy.

111
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:35,000
Oh, good dodging.

112
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:36,000
Jump into it.

113
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:39,000
Damn.

114
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:40,000
How long is streaming going?

115
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:41,000
I just started.

116
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:43,000
I literally just started like five minutes ago.

117
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:51,000
Oh, boy, that's that.

118
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:57,000
Oh, come on.

119
00:07:57,000 --> 00:08:00,000
Fire over, fire over.

120
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:05,000
Oh, I didn't kill him.

121
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:09,000
Oh, I thought he was going to go to the, ah.

122
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:10,000
I'm going to die.

123
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:13,000
He knows how much health I have.

124
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:14,000
Oh, run away.

125
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:21,000
Dead.

126
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:22,000
Aqua fire 102.

127
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:25,000
What's up, dude?

128
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:26,000
No demo man.

129
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:27,000
I'll change this stuff.

130
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:30,000
Oh, by the way, if anybody has noticed, not sure if you've noticed.

131
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:32,000
Oh, God, that's great again.

132
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:35,000
But my, I changed my FOV.

133
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:36,000
I made it bigger.

134
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:37,000
I'll show you what I did.

135
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:42,000
I didn't make it too huge, but here's my FOV now.

136
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:49,000
I changed it to like, like 30% more, and I made my weapon view model like 30% more.

137
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:54,000
So if you've noticed that, I know a lot of people are saying, please change that.

138
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:56,000
So I did.

139
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:58,000
It actually is a little bit better.

140
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:06,000
Easier to see things.

141
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:11,000
Got a healer now, alright.

142
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:15,000
Okay, he's got a fucking piano.

143
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:17,000
Oh, I didn't kill him.

144
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:18,000
He walks right over and too.

145
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:21,000
What did he come from?

146
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:23,000
What did he even come from?

147
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:24,000
Was he the medic?

148
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:27,000
No, the medic was healing me.

149
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:29,000
Like, the medic behind me was healing me.

150
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:31,000
He just came out of legit nowhere.

151
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:33,000
Dear NG, I staffed your centuries.

152
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:34,000
See you again soon.

153
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:36,000
I'm going to kill all the spy.

154
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:37,000
Spray over.

155
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:39,000
That's a nice spray.

156
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:41,000
That's how he gets in here.

157
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:43,000
He's the least alive.

158
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:46,000
Don't let him get me.

159
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:48,000
Don't let him get me.

160
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:51,000
Oh, he's got nowhere to go now.

161
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:53,000
How did he get that?

162
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:54,000
He's going to get me.

163
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:56,000
He's doing a side stab.

164
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:58,000
I'm not going to move.

165
00:09:58,000 --> 00:09:59,000
Yeah.

166
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:01,000
There we go.

167
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:04,000
Dear NG, I staffed your century.

168
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:05,000
Oh, and I'll move that.

169
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:06,000
That's me.

170
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:07,000
Yeah.

171
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:08,000
Now I got to...

172
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:11,000
We're going to get rolled right now.

173
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:12,000
Oh, my God.

174
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:13,000
I haven't done anything.

175
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:15,000
I do why I don't have one kill.

176
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:24,000
Oh, you're making me waste my stuff, Scout.

177
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:30,000
Oh, come on.

178
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:33,000
I don't know how to hit him.

179
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:39,000
Let's get him out of here.

180
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:41,000
He's not dead.

181
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:42,000
He is not dead.

182
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:45,000
He is definitely still alive.

183
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:51,000
All right, let's go for a super spam shot here, dude.

184
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:53,000
Come on, walk over that.

185
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:54,000
Oh, my God.

186
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:57,000
Oh, God.

187
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:59,000
Chaos.

188
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:02,000
Why, why, what I have crits for?

189
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:04,000
I got, I got, I got.

190
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:05,000
What I'm waste.

191
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:07,000
Let me get the medic at least.

192
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:08,000
Thank goodness.

193
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:13,000
If I didn't kill that medic, I would have been so upset with myself.

194
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:16,000
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, pamphlet.

195
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:20,000
Do I like Twitch or do I like YouTube better?

196
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:26,000
Um, I mean, YouTube has a lot of problems right now.

197
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:30,000
There's a lot of glitches with YouTube. There's a lot of bugs and stuff.

198
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:32,000
And it's in beta. I can understand that.

199
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:34,000
But it's um...

200
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:37,000
I would definitely say the process is much easier on Twitch.

201
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:40,000
That's what I will just say at least.

202
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:43,000
The YouTube stream is better quality though, because I'm partnered on YouTube

203
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:48,000
and I'm partnered through Mishinima. So the YouTube stream will look better.

204
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:49,000
But I don't know.

205
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:53,000
Hopefully they fix up some of their bugs. I'm confident they will.

206
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:59,000
Oh, I'm just gulping.

207
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:00,000
There he is.

208
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:01,000
Whoa!

209
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:08,000
It's really walk through there.

210
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:11,000
Medic!

211
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:14,000
Yeah, I'll go combat in Junex.

212
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:15,000
Absolute.

213
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:21,000
Look at all these people. Like goodness.

214
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:22,000
Oh, don't use that. Don't use that. Don't use that.

215
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:23,000
Don't use that. Don't use that.

216
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:26,000
Oh, man.

217
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:33,000
Oh, come on, kill somebody.

218
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:36,000
Oh, my God. Come on now.

219
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:38,000
Oh, I got the medic. Good.

220
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:41,000
Oh, keep coming.

221
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:44,000
Oh, no! Come on, give me the help.

222
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:47,000
What? Uber! What?

223
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:50,000
Escape. Escape. Oh, damn.

224
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:52,000
Damn.

225
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:56,000
Thought I was gonna escape, but I didn't.

226
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:02,000
Boom.

227
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:06,000
Yeah, after this round, I'm gonna go combat, Angie.

228
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:08,000
Oh, there's a crit dude right there.

229
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:13,000
Oh, no, give me away.

230
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:19,000
Where's the spy? He's up top there. He's going up this way. Get up.

231
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:20,000
No!

232
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:22,000
Why am I stuck in the staircase?

233
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:24,000
Is that another spy?

234
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:26,000
Yeah, there he is.

235
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:30,000
I love how it's just like everyone's running frantically around chasing this spy.

236
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:32,000
Oh, walk over that, please.

237
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:35,000
Somebody go to the left side. Come on.

238
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:37,000
There you go.

239
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:39,000
I dropped a dog there.

240
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:42,000
Can we go up there?

241
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:46,000
I'll leave that there. That can be the defense.

242
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:50,000
Spam.

243
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:55,000
Oh, God. Can we run the car? No, I'm not yet.

244
00:13:57,000 --> 00:13:59,000
Get away from me.

245
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:01,000
Yeah, come on. Get on the car now.

246
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:04,000
Come step on that car. You know you want to.

247
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:08,000
Ah, come on. Get him.

248
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:11,000
Somebody get on that car. I want to blow it up.

249
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:18,000
I need to get healed.

250
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:21,000
Wait, is there a spy up there? It's spawn, isn't there?

251
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:24,000
I might have to go deal with that. Hold on.

252
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:27,000
I'll just launch myself into nowhere.

253
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:31,000
What? What is going on? Why? Why are they bouncing?

254
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:33,000
Oh, well, because...

255
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:36,000
Where's this spy?

256
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:39,000
He's freaking me out.

257
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:44,000
Is that a sniper?

258
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:46,000
No.

259
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:48,000
Yikes.

260
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:51,000
The IP, I linked it a while ago.

261
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:54,000
I'm going to be changing servers after this anyways.

262
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:57,000
And get more people into the game.

263
00:14:57,000 --> 00:15:01,000
There's a lot of people in this room.

264
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:04,000
Oh, this is definitely a lot of people still in here.

265
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:06,000
All crits.

266
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:08,000
Oh, I didn't get anybody.

267
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:13,000
Oh, I'm going to be behind soldier.

268
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:17,000
Hold on. I got to deal with this.

269
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:20,000
Oh!

270
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:23,000
That's a spy.

271
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:26,000
That's definitely a spy. No way.

272
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:29,000
Maybe not. No, it's not a spy.

273
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:32,000
Wow.

274
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:36,000
Oh, my God.

275
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:39,000
I was not ready for this, but I'm going to do it anyways.

276
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:41,000
Let's do it.

277
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:44,000
Oh, come on. Have they be something over here?

278
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:46,000
I can pull people up.

279
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:50,000
Oh, you bastard.

280
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:57,000
Germa is a wizard.

281
00:15:57,000 --> 00:16:00,000
Official.

282
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:03,000
Oh, I'm going to be a wizard.

283
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:06,000
I'm going to be a wizard.

284
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:09,000
Let's go.

285
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:13,000
Oh, man. Look at all those people.

286
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:15,000
How am I doing?

287
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:18,000
I'm not that bad.

288
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:21,000
No, no 720 here.

289
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:26,000
I am not part of it on Twitch.

290
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:29,000
It's over.

291
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:35,000
I'm not that bad, just or today.

292
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:41,000
Oh, I killed myself. Damn.

293
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:46,000
I want to start livestreaming soon.

294
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:49,000
Any advice on how to get started?

295
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:54,000
Most important thing is your internet needs to be able to handle it.

296
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:57,000
You can use it as a guide.

297
00:16:57,000 --> 00:17:00,000
You can use it as a guide.

298
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:03,000
You can use it as a guide.

299
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:06,000
You can use it as a guide.

300
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:09,000
You can use it as a guide.

301
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:12,000
You can use it as a guide.

302
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:15,000
You can use it as a guide.

303
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:18,000
You can use it as a guide.

304
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:21,000
You can use it as a guide.

305
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:24,000
I have 10 up connection.

306
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:27,000
Oh, my god.

307
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:30,000
Oh, my god.

308
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:33,000
Somebody run over that.

309
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:36,000
There we go.

310
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:39,000
Yes, yes, yes, yes.

311
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:42,000
That's what I wanted to run.

312
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:45,000
You guys have been estranged before where it's been unwatchable from lag.

313
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:48,000
I'm not that bad.

314
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:51,000
I'm not that bad.

315
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:54,000
I'm not that bad.

316
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:57,000
I'm not that bad.

317
00:17:57,000 --> 00:18:00,000
I'm not that bad.

318
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:03,000
I'm not that bad.

319
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:06,000
I'm not that bad.

320
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:09,000
I'm not that bad.

321
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:12,000
I'm not that bad.

322
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:15,000
I love any animal.

323
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:21,000
The only animal that I could probably say I don't like is...

324
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:24,000
I don't know.

325
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:26,000
Maybe like...

326
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:28,000
This is a hard question.

327
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:31,000
The only animal that I don't think I would like to...

328
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:32,000
Oh, my god.

329
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:34,000
Another Uber this is.

330
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:38,000
I like the Uber machine tonight.

331
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:42,000
Oh, it's crazy.

332
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:48,000
Anyways, probably an animal big enough that will like literally kill me if I go near it.

333
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:53,000
So, probably something like that.

334
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:56,000
Oh, yeah, four up is fine.

335
00:18:56,000 --> 00:19:02,000
You'll be fine with four up.

336
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:06,000
Here we go.

337
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:09,000
Oh, boy.

338
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:12,000
I feel like the other team is getting neglected.

339
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:13,000
Spread the Uber's around.

340
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:16,000
I don't need them all.

341
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:19,000
We're going up top here.

342
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:23,000
Or I can just apparently not detonate the mine.

343
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:25,000
What's going on here?

344
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:27,000
So many people.

345
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:33,000
So many people to spam.

346
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:36,000
This is chaos.

347
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:38,000
Oh, this is absolute chaos.

348
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:43,000
Oh, my god.

349
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:45,000
This is ridiculous.

350
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:52,000
There are two player servers in sanity.

351
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:53,000
Yeah, this...

352
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:54,000
Oh, my god.

353
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:58,000
Yeah, this is a full group in here, man.

354
00:19:58,000 --> 00:20:02,000
Yeah, right after this round ends, I'm going to hop in a new server.

355
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:09,000
Oh, slide.

356
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:10,000
Oh, that's a double.

357
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:16,000
That's a double.

358
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:20,000
What's going on here?

359
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:21,000
Hey, hey you.

360
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:23,000
Oh, you're real.

361
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:26,000
I was going high five.

362
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:32,000
Oh, you want high five?

363
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:35,000
Oh, sure, I'll high five you.

364
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:38,000
And then just explode myself.

365
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:43,000
Wow, that was pretty unintelligent, dumpy.

366
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:47,000
But yeah, that's what I do.

367
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:50,000
All right, new server.

368
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:54,000
Server.

369
00:20:54,000 --> 00:21:00,000
Wait.

370
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:03,000
Oh, you want to see my brain.

371
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:05,000
A lot of you guys already know this.

372
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:07,000
Sometimes my brain.

373
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:13,000
I just don't think it happens quite often actually.

374
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:15,000
All right, let's see.

375
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:22,000
Let's see here.

376
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:25,000
Hmm, I would say let's play a randomizer server.

377
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:30,000
But for my streams, I like to get a lot of people into the games.

378
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:33,000
As many people as I possibly can that are watching.

379
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:39,000
So I don't want to just, you know, because most of the randomizer and arena mod tech servers, they're always full.

380
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:41,000
They always have, you know, 23 out of 24.

381
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:44,000
So I would be the only one that would be able to get in.

382
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:50,000
So I like to have people from the stream get priority and come and play and stuff like that.

383
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:53,000
Let's find another server.

384
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:58,000
All right, oh my god, there's so many loading.

385
00:21:58,000 --> 00:22:00,000
Looking for 32.

386
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:01,000
Hi, tower.

387
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:03,000
Got a bunch of bots.

388
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:08,000
Well, I ever do a workout video.

389
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:11,000
I've thrown it around.

390
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:13,000
I was going to do it a long time ago.

391
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:17,000
But it's just, I don't know if people would even watch it.

392
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:22,000
I know that they would be a very small group of people that would probably watch it.

393
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:25,000
But I don't know if like how it would be received.

394
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:28,000
I think a lot of people would be like, what the hell are you doing?

395
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:31,000
Like, why are you like a Whiston Wates?

396
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:33,000
24 or 20?

397
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:36,000
You're 32.

398
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:37,000
Okay.

399
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:38,000
Well, here we go.

400
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:41,000
Good old fashion dustball.

401
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:46,000
Here is the IP.

402
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:50,000
Oh, everyone's always asking about Enlighten.

403
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:52,000
The new Enlighten.

404
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:54,000
I'm working on it right now.

405
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:58,000
So there will be a new Enlighten in the next couple days.

406
00:22:58,000 --> 00:23:04,000
Working on it right now.

407
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:08,000
Yeah, I'll probably do another one of those videos where I give advice.

408
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:14,000
And I'll probably do like maybe a one or two minute vlog type thing where I show you some stuff.

409
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:17,000
But I'm not sure I would do like a 20 minute workout video.

410
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:21,000
Like, okay, then up, then down, then up, then left.

411
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:23,000
I think that would just be odd.

412
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:25,000
I mean, I think there would be very weird.

413
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:26,000
Let's go blue.

414
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:27,000
I was red last time.

415
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:33,000
Let's go blue.

416
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:34,000
Oh, boom.

417
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:35,000
Boom.

418
00:23:35,000 --> 00:23:37,000
Now, what do I want to use?

419
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:38,000
Oh, the new PDA.

420
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:42,000
What's going to be your like, oh,

421
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:45,000
the new PDA.

422
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:52,000
And up, and down, and left, and egg.

423
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:55,000
And egg.

424
00:23:55,000 --> 00:23:57,000
Alright, let me say this.

425
00:23:57,000 --> 00:24:04,000
Would you guys watch an egg workout video?

426
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:08,000
Like, if it was the egg.

427
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:10,000
What do I want to even play with?

428
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:12,000
I'll stay with this.

429
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:13,000
I'll stick with this.

430
00:24:13,000 --> 00:24:14,000
Why not?

431
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:15,000
Boom.

432
00:24:15,000 --> 00:24:16,000
Boom.

433
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:17,000
Boom.

434
00:24:17,000 --> 00:24:19,000
Boom.

435
00:24:19,000 --> 00:24:23,000
This server is like, is this server like weird?

436
00:24:23,000 --> 00:24:25,000
It's like, I'm like lagging.

437
00:24:25,000 --> 00:24:32,000
Oh, I'm trying, I tried to have an iPhone.

438
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:34,000
Oh, wait, you can just hold your hand like that?

439
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:35,000
Oh, yeah.

440
00:24:35,000 --> 00:24:38,000
I thought, maybe.

441
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:41,000
I don't know if it's like the server enough.

442
00:24:41,000 --> 00:24:43,000
Is everybody like all jumpy?

443
00:24:43,000 --> 00:24:44,000
Because they are on my screen.

444
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:45,000
Like, look at it.

445
00:24:45,000 --> 00:24:47,000
Is anybody else see that?

446
00:24:47,000 --> 00:24:53,000
I don't want to go for one or two rounds like this.

447
00:24:53,000 --> 00:24:54,000
Oh, high five.

448
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:55,000
Here we go.

449
00:24:55,000 --> 00:24:59,000
Shloping.

450
00:24:59,000 --> 00:25:02,000
Yeah, I mean.

451
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:07,000
Oh, God, everyone's like jumping all over the place for me.

452
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:10,000
Oh.

453
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:12,000
Centred down.

454
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:14,000
Hey, hey, hey.

455
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:19,000
What do you think you're doing?

456
00:25:19,000 --> 00:25:21,000
Oh, but I forgot I was going to answer that question.

457
00:25:21,000 --> 00:25:25,000
The reason why I don't do auto reload is because it's somebody in here?

458
00:25:25,000 --> 00:25:28,000
Like the ghost of the pyro just in that room with me.

459
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:29,000
Oh, no.

460
00:25:29,000 --> 00:25:30,000
Oh, God.

461
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:33,000
What am I doing?

462
00:25:33,000 --> 00:25:36,000
All right, well, here we are.

463
00:25:37,000 --> 00:25:39,000
I'll block you way out.

464
00:25:39,000 --> 00:25:40,000
You can't get out.

465
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:41,000
You're a dead ringer.

466
00:25:41,000 --> 00:25:43,000
I got you blocked in.

467
00:25:43,000 --> 00:25:44,000
Hey.

468
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:45,000
Hey.

469
00:25:45,000 --> 00:25:46,000
Hey.

470
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:48,000
Hey.

471
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:52,000
That there's a tip right there.

472
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:54,000
If you shoot a dead ringer and you know he's a dead ringer,

473
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:56,000
just stand in the middle of the hallway.

474
00:25:56,000 --> 00:25:58,000
And he can't get by you.

475
00:25:58,000 --> 00:26:01,000
At least, at least sometimes.

476
00:26:01,000 --> 00:26:04,000
Oh, just spads are going up up here.

477
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:07,000
Why I decided to put him here is a bad idea.

478
00:26:07,000 --> 00:26:10,000
Oh, yes.

479
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:12,000
Where is my mini-century?

480
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:13,000
Why is it still alive?

481
00:26:13,000 --> 00:26:18,000
Oh, my God.

482
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:19,000
I'm getting distracted.

483
00:26:19,000 --> 00:26:20,000
I get distracted.

484
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:21,000
I have ADD, man.

485
00:26:21,000 --> 00:26:24,000
Wow, we already won.

486
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:27,000
My goodness.

487
00:26:27,000 --> 00:26:30,000
My goodness.

488
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:33,000
FG Spidey, Betia, I can say your name.

489
00:26:33,000 --> 00:26:38,000
Betia, I bet you a dollar, I can say your name.

490
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:43,000
32-man Dust Bowl is chaos.

491
00:26:43,000 --> 00:26:47,000
I'm going to go Huntsman Sniper.

492
00:26:47,000 --> 00:26:51,000
If you want to throw me a duel, I'll absolutely do it.

493
00:26:51,000 --> 00:26:56,000
Ah.

494
00:26:56,000 --> 00:26:59,000
Oh, now I go, let me say I'm going to

495
00:26:59,000 --> 00:27:04,000
go.

496
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:08,000
Sion, it's a good idea.

497
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:11,000
Oh, by the way, if you're watching this on YouTube,

498
00:27:11,000 --> 00:27:13,000
I'm going to upload this to YouTube afterwards.

499
00:27:13,000 --> 00:27:16,000
Yes, I'm responding to people in the chat.

500
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:20,000
So don't just think I have weird disorder where I just say random words.

501
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:23,000
I guess I said that last time too.

502
00:27:23,000 --> 00:27:25,000
Oh, come on.

503
00:27:25,000 --> 00:27:28,000
This guy is going to get head shot right now.

504
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:30,000
Here we go, ready.

505
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:33,000
I don't think you know, I don't think you understand.

506
00:27:33,000 --> 00:27:35,000
I don't think you understand.

507
00:27:35,000 --> 00:27:36,000
Here it comes.

508
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:39,000
Oh, my God, he killed me.

509
00:27:39,000 --> 00:27:42,000
Oh, no, a different guy did.

510
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:45,000
Eggs.

511
00:27:45,000 --> 00:27:51,000
Look at this like egg.

512
00:27:51,000 --> 00:27:53,000
Man, this server is lagging for me.

513
00:27:53,000 --> 00:27:54,000
I'll tell you right now.

514
00:27:54,000 --> 00:27:59,000
Look at this double spy collateral.

515
00:27:59,000 --> 00:28:06,000
Oh, no, run away.

516
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:12,000
Oh, tack.

517
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:14,000
Oh, I can't even aim at people.

518
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:17,000
My screen is like, it's like a jellyfish.

519
00:28:17,000 --> 00:28:19,000
Oh, he got me.

520
00:28:19,000 --> 00:28:23,000
He got me.

521
00:28:23,000 --> 00:28:30,000
Oh, whoa, whoa.

522
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:32,000
Oh, look at the server.

523
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:36,000
I don't think the server was designed that, but it's pretty people in it.

524
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:38,000
Oh, wait, you want to get covered in jirati?

525
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:39,000
Is that what you're saying?

526
00:28:39,000 --> 00:28:40,000
You want me to come smash here?

527
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:41,000
Is that what you just said?

528
00:28:41,000 --> 00:28:43,000
You want me to come like smash your face in?

529
00:28:43,000 --> 00:28:47,000
I got him.

530
00:28:47,000 --> 00:28:50,000
Fan of Kid Icarus, I never played it.

531
00:28:50,000 --> 00:28:51,000
Not even the original.

532
00:28:51,000 --> 00:28:58,000
Oh, that would have been sick.

533
00:28:58,000 --> 00:29:05,000
I heard somebody.

534
00:29:05,000 --> 00:29:10,000
I love to kill somebody.

535
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:13,000
Finally.

536
00:29:13,000 --> 00:29:15,000
I got my first kill, but whoa.

537
00:29:15,000 --> 00:29:17,000
That's because you see where I shot.

538
00:29:17,000 --> 00:29:22,000
If you're watching this on YouTube, please rewind that and look at where I shot.

539
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:24,000
I shot like five feet over that guy's head.

540
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:31,000
I still killed him.

541
00:29:31,000 --> 00:29:34,000
Oh, God.

542
00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:40,000
Let's just do it.

543
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:47,000
Oh, there's no way I was going to get out of there.

544
00:29:47,000 --> 00:29:51,000
A good affordable graphics card.

545
00:29:51,000 --> 00:29:54,000
That's a good one.

546
00:29:54,000 --> 00:30:00,000
I'd say probably like the GTX 550 or the 560.

547
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:02,000
I think those are both under 200 bucks.

548
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:04,000
I think under 100.

549
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:07,000
I think the 550 is, I don't know, the 550 Ti, I think it's called.

550
00:30:07,000 --> 00:30:10,000
I don't even remember.

551
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:16,000
Oh, I missed him.

552
00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:21,000
I think Ag should be a weapon.

553
00:30:21,000 --> 00:30:23,000
I don't know how well they work.

554
00:30:23,000 --> 00:30:24,000
Oh, it's simsass.

555
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:26,000
You got the 550?

556
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:29,000
How much is the 550?

557
00:30:29,000 --> 00:30:34,000
And follow up, is it a good graphics card?

558
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:37,000
There we go.

559
00:30:37,000 --> 00:30:41,000
Oh, my God.

560
00:30:41,000 --> 00:30:43,000
Hey, let's go on.

561
00:30:43,000 --> 00:30:48,000
Just hiding over here, away from you.

562
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:56,000
No, no, please don't kill me, please.

563
00:30:56,000 --> 00:31:02,000
Did you buy the 550 or did it come with your computer?

564
00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:07,000
No, I'm thinking.

565
00:31:07,000 --> 00:31:11,000
I didn't get him.

566
00:31:11,000 --> 00:31:13,000
Oh crap.

567
00:31:13,000 --> 00:31:14,000
Okay, yeah.

568
00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:17,000
So the 550 is only like 130 bucks.

569
00:31:17,000 --> 00:31:21,000
I'd say that's a good graphics card to be able to save a little bit of money.

570
00:31:21,000 --> 00:31:26,000
Because the 580 is what, like $500?

571
00:31:26,000 --> 00:31:28,000
Something like that?

572
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:31,000
I know it's up there.

573
00:31:31,000 --> 00:31:34,000
And they're already working on the 600, aren't they?

574
00:31:34,000 --> 00:31:37,000
The 600 series?

575
00:31:37,000 --> 00:31:39,000
Oh.

576
00:31:39,000 --> 00:31:41,000
Is that?

577
00:31:41,000 --> 00:31:42,000
Okay, you're real.

578
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:43,000
You're the real deal.

579
00:31:43,000 --> 00:31:48,000
I got you.

580
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:49,000
Oh, cover them all.

581
00:31:49,000 --> 00:31:50,000
Okay, okay.

582
00:31:50,000 --> 00:31:52,000
Did I even get...

583
00:31:52,000 --> 00:31:53,000
No.

584
00:31:53,000 --> 00:31:54,000
Get this one guy.

585
00:31:54,000 --> 00:31:58,000
Come on.

586
00:31:58,000 --> 00:32:00,000
The 680 is out now.

587
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:02,000
Oh, dear Lord, what is that?

588
00:32:02,000 --> 00:32:06,000
Like $900?

589
00:32:06,000 --> 00:32:11,000
You can only imagine.

590
00:32:11,000 --> 00:32:17,000
Woo!

591
00:32:17,000 --> 00:32:22,000
I don't think we're going to win this.

592
00:32:22,000 --> 00:32:29,000
Oh god, these people over there too.

593
00:32:29,000 --> 00:32:33,000
All right, I'm going this way.

594
00:32:33,000 --> 00:32:35,000
Is anybody up here?

595
00:32:35,000 --> 00:32:37,000
We almost just got it.

596
00:32:37,000 --> 00:32:39,000
Oh, he's still alive.

597
00:32:39,000 --> 00:32:41,000
He's still alive.

598
00:32:41,000 --> 00:32:46,000
Oh my god.

599
00:32:46,000 --> 00:32:50,000
He gets like crushed that guy.

600
00:32:50,000 --> 00:32:52,000
Geez.

601
00:32:52,000 --> 00:32:54,000
Oh, forget that.

602
00:32:54,000 --> 00:32:57,000
I'm going this way.

603
00:32:57,000 --> 00:33:03,000
Oh my god.

604
00:33:03,000 --> 00:33:08,000
That's my favorite movie?

605
00:33:08,000 --> 00:33:10,000
I don't know.

606
00:33:10,000 --> 00:33:18,000
Probably Ghostbusters or Memento or The Dark Knight or one of the Muppet movies or there's

607
00:33:18,000 --> 00:33:20,000
a lot of movies I've watched that I like.

608
00:33:20,000 --> 00:33:22,000
I'm not a big movie watcher though.

609
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:25,000
I'm not even a big TV watcher either.

610
00:33:25,000 --> 00:33:34,000
Oh my god, I just missed his head.

611
00:33:34,000 --> 00:33:36,000
Oh, this guy could be toast.

612
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:40,000
Oh my god.

613
00:33:40,000 --> 00:33:43,000
You know it from me.

614
00:33:43,000 --> 00:33:47,000
Oh, this guy doesn't even know him here.

615
00:33:47,000 --> 00:33:54,000
Damn it.

616
00:33:54,000 --> 00:33:56,000
Fight Club is also a good one, Ari.

617
00:33:56,000 --> 00:33:59,000
Fight Club is a good one.

618
00:33:59,000 --> 00:34:02,000
I'm over the first time I watched Fight Club.

619
00:34:02,000 --> 00:34:03,000
I was so confused.

620
00:34:03,000 --> 00:34:07,000
I think I was like 16, like 17.

621
00:34:07,000 --> 00:34:08,000
When did that movie come up?

622
00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:11,000
Somebody do a quick research and find out when did Fight Club releasing?

623
00:34:11,000 --> 00:34:14,000
When did it come up with the others?

624
00:34:14,000 --> 00:34:16,000
Is somebody right in the foot, ready?

625
00:34:16,000 --> 00:34:19,000
Right in the toe.

626
00:34:19,000 --> 00:34:23,000
Oh my god, hide.

627
00:34:24,000 --> 00:34:27,000
I want to see if like, ramp up and beatbox?

628
00:34:27,000 --> 00:34:29,000
I don't think you can.

629
00:34:29,000 --> 00:34:32,000
I would assume ramp up could not beatbox.

630
00:34:32,000 --> 00:34:35,000
1999, okay.

631
00:34:35,000 --> 00:34:37,000
Oh.

632
00:34:37,000 --> 00:34:39,000
So that means I was.

633
00:34:39,000 --> 00:34:41,000
So 10 years ago was 2009.

634
00:34:41,000 --> 00:34:43,000
So 10, 11, 12.

635
00:34:43,000 --> 00:34:46,000
So that was 13 years ago.

636
00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:49,000
I was.

637
00:34:49,000 --> 00:34:54,000
So I'm 26, 16, 15, 14, 13.

638
00:34:54,000 --> 00:34:56,000
I definitely didn't watch it when I was 13.

639
00:34:56,000 --> 00:34:58,000
I don't think my parents would have let me do that.

640
00:34:58,000 --> 00:35:11,000
I mean, once I watched it, when I, I think the first time I watched it when I was like 15 or 16, something like that.

641
00:35:11,000 --> 00:35:14,000
And I was confused.

642
00:35:14,000 --> 00:35:18,000
I was absolutely confused.

643
00:35:18,000 --> 00:35:21,000
Office space is a good movie too.

644
00:35:21,000 --> 00:35:24,000
The thing is, I've seen a lot of movies, but I don't watch a lot of movies.

645
00:35:24,000 --> 00:35:31,000
If that makes any sense to anybody, then oh my god, I accidentally got that guy.

646
00:35:31,000 --> 00:35:32,000
Greetings from Chile.

647
00:35:32,000 --> 00:35:36,000
Well, greetings from East Coast USA, dude.

648
00:35:36,000 --> 00:35:38,000
It's either very early or very late for you.

649
00:35:38,000 --> 00:35:39,000
I'm not sure.

650
00:35:39,000 --> 00:35:41,000
Actually, no, I think we're in the same time zone.

651
00:35:41,000 --> 00:35:44,000
We're close, the same time zone.

652
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:45,000
Oh my god.

653
00:35:45,000 --> 00:35:50,000
All right, time to play Scout.

654
00:35:50,000 --> 00:35:53,000
My real name is Jeremy.

655
00:35:53,000 --> 00:35:54,000
It's Jeremy.

656
00:35:54,000 --> 00:35:59,000
J-E-R-E-M-Y.

657
00:35:59,000 --> 00:36:00,000
Look at all these people he's blowing out.

658
00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:02,000
Look at this good Pyro right here.

659
00:36:02,000 --> 00:36:06,000
Just running around blowing all the teammates out.

660
00:36:06,000 --> 00:36:09,000
You get a gold star.

661
00:36:09,000 --> 00:36:11,000
No, it's not Jeremiah.

662
00:36:11,000 --> 00:36:14,000
It's just Jeremy.

663
00:36:14,000 --> 00:36:21,000
Oh, there's a lot of people right there.

664
00:36:21,000 --> 00:36:29,000
Hmm, what chip, what chip, what chip?

665
00:36:29,000 --> 00:36:32,000
Okay, alright, Scout's not gonna work.

666
00:36:32,000 --> 00:36:35,000
I'll go medic.

667
00:36:35,000 --> 00:36:36,000
Do I like Irish people?

668
00:36:36,000 --> 00:36:37,000
I do.

669
00:36:37,000 --> 00:36:38,000
I am Irish.

670
00:36:38,000 --> 00:36:43,000
I am Irish, so.

671
00:36:44,000 --> 00:36:47,000
Look at this server.

672
00:36:47,000 --> 00:36:51,000
After a change servers after I die next,

673
00:36:51,000 --> 00:36:53,000
just because the server is very laggy.

674
00:36:53,000 --> 00:36:54,000
Look at this guy.

675
00:36:54,000 --> 00:36:56,000
Looks like he's probably like a claymation.

676
00:36:56,000 --> 00:37:01,000
Look at this claymation server we're on.

677
00:37:04,000 --> 00:37:08,000
Oh, no, no, no, no.

678
00:37:09,000 --> 00:37:12,000
Oh, this is why I like the quick fix.

679
00:37:12,000 --> 00:37:14,000
You can just do this and it like makes sense.

680
00:37:14,000 --> 00:37:19,000
Oh my god, that was the guy I have to steal.

681
00:37:19,000 --> 00:37:26,000
New server.

682
00:37:26,000 --> 00:37:29,000
Yeah, new server, what's this?

683
00:37:29,000 --> 00:37:33,000
Oh, yeah, he defeated me.

684
00:37:33,000 --> 00:37:36,000
Probably hop in one more server.

685
00:37:36,000 --> 00:37:39,000
And try some tribes to send.

686
00:37:39,000 --> 00:37:43,000
Because that game is really cool.

687
00:37:43,000 --> 00:37:51,000
Let's go zero out of 24 this time just to keep the lag factor down a little.

688
00:37:51,000 --> 00:37:53,000
Can you give the health sawmill?

689
00:37:53,000 --> 00:37:54,000
Can you give the health nucleus?

690
00:37:54,000 --> 00:37:58,000
That could be good.

691
00:37:59,000 --> 00:38:04,000
Can you give the health sawmill?

692
00:38:04,000 --> 00:38:06,000
Hi tower.

693
00:38:06,000 --> 00:38:10,000
I'm torn guys, I don't know where to go.

694
00:38:10,000 --> 00:38:12,000
You are garbage germ.

695
00:38:12,000 --> 00:38:13,000
Why?

696
00:38:13,000 --> 00:38:18,000
What did I do?

697
00:38:18,000 --> 00:38:22,000
Oh, bad water.

698
00:38:22,000 --> 00:38:26,000
Mountain lab.

699
00:38:26,000 --> 00:38:29,000
A day in the life of germa.

700
00:38:29,000 --> 00:38:37,000
Where I just eat like Cheetos and take a bath.

701
00:38:37,000 --> 00:38:39,000
We're going to go here.

702
00:38:39,000 --> 00:38:42,000
We're going to go to via dot.

703
00:38:42,000 --> 00:38:44,000
Caught via dot.

704
00:38:44,000 --> 00:38:53,000
There's the IP.

705
00:38:53,000 --> 00:38:55,000
I put the IP right in chat.

706
00:38:55,000 --> 00:39:00,000
Should say a little camera next to my name.

707
00:39:00,000 --> 00:39:08,000
Let's go.

708
00:39:08,000 --> 00:39:11,000
Let's go.

709
00:39:11,000 --> 00:39:15,000
This is a very weird load up.

710
00:39:15,000 --> 00:39:20,000
I'm not sure what I was trying to do here.

711
00:39:20,000 --> 00:39:31,000
I got the strange dead ring.

712
00:39:31,000 --> 00:39:35,000
The server's full.

713
00:39:35,000 --> 00:39:43,000
What am I talking about?

714
00:39:43,000 --> 00:39:50,000
I'm not sure what I was trying to do here.

715
00:39:50,000 --> 00:39:57,000
If you can't get in or trying to get in, I apologize.

716
00:39:57,000 --> 00:40:01,000
I think I do have a strange.

717
00:40:01,000 --> 00:40:06,000
Thanks for putting that up.

718
00:40:06,000 --> 00:40:11,000
It's going to belong to somebody else pretty soon.

719
00:40:11,000 --> 00:40:14,000
I'm an engineer walking out of you from the other side.

720
00:40:14,000 --> 00:40:17,000
Oh, you got me.

721
00:40:17,000 --> 00:40:20,000
Damn.

722
00:40:20,000 --> 00:40:24,000
How dare you kill me like that.

723
00:40:24,000 --> 00:40:35,000
If I could go pro at any sport, baseball.

724
00:40:35,000 --> 00:40:38,000
I've always wanted to be a baseball player.

725
00:40:38,000 --> 00:40:41,000
I'm not exactly sure why, but I just have.

726
00:40:41,000 --> 00:40:44,000
I used to play baseball when I was younger.

727
00:40:44,000 --> 00:40:52,000
Into high school, and I stopped in high school.

728
00:40:52,000 --> 00:40:55,000
Oh, my dead...

729
00:40:55,000 --> 00:40:58,000
Wait, now they're going to all know that I'm dead wrong.

730
00:40:58,000 --> 00:41:03,000
Dead wrong is that even like a word.

731
00:41:03,000 --> 00:41:05,000
Oh, let's protect this point.

732
00:41:05,000 --> 00:41:09,000
I'm a pyro. I do that the best.

733
00:41:09,000 --> 00:41:18,000
Now it's just a scared chaos stab right there.

734
00:41:18,000 --> 00:41:19,000
What do you wear?

735
00:41:19,000 --> 00:41:24,000
The team is still trickling in.

736
00:41:24,000 --> 00:41:28,000
Look, I'm just coming out of spawn in myself.

737
00:41:29,000 --> 00:41:34,000
Hey, let's get out of spawn together.

738
00:41:34,000 --> 00:41:36,000
Oh, German, I'm cheating.

739
00:41:36,000 --> 00:41:42,000
I'm watching you stream.

740
00:41:42,000 --> 00:41:45,000
Is my name even German right now?

741
00:41:45,000 --> 00:41:48,000
Oh, scrumpa dump.

742
00:41:48,000 --> 00:41:50,000
Harvey Hanbert.

743
00:41:50,000 --> 00:41:52,000
George Bumberson.

744
00:41:52,000 --> 00:41:56,000
I go by a lot of different titles.

745
00:41:56,000 --> 00:41:58,000
I won't get out of my way.

746
00:41:58,000 --> 00:42:00,000
Oh, you son of a b.

747
00:42:00,000 --> 00:42:03,000
Well, that's like five million deaths in a row.

748
00:42:03,000 --> 00:42:08,000
It's by the time the change's up enough.

749
00:42:08,000 --> 00:42:15,000
Low FPS.

750
00:42:15,000 --> 00:42:17,000
Oh, what am I even using?

751
00:42:17,000 --> 00:42:19,000
Okay, I'll rock with this.

752
00:42:19,000 --> 00:42:21,000
I'll roll with this.

753
00:42:21,000 --> 00:42:24,000
I'm cool with that.

754
00:42:24,000 --> 00:42:31,000
I thought that was a spy.

755
00:42:31,000 --> 00:42:36,000
Oh.

756
00:42:36,000 --> 00:42:38,000
What just happened?

757
00:42:38,000 --> 00:42:40,000
Oh, my brain.

758
00:42:40,000 --> 00:42:42,000
There was a soldier right there.

759
00:42:42,000 --> 00:42:44,000
I just killed that medic.

760
00:42:44,000 --> 00:42:48,000
I'm sorry, dude.

761
00:42:48,000 --> 00:42:53,000
I don't think I've ever had an embarrassing name.

762
00:42:54,000 --> 00:42:57,000
Oh, my preferred breakfast food.

763
00:42:57,000 --> 00:42:59,000
Oh, you kidding me?

764
00:42:59,000 --> 00:43:01,000
Eggs.

765
00:43:01,000 --> 00:43:03,000
I had to say.

766
00:43:03,000 --> 00:43:05,000
What have we got here?

767
00:43:05,000 --> 00:43:06,000
All right.

768
00:43:06,000 --> 00:43:07,000
No more fooling around.

769
00:43:07,000 --> 00:43:10,000
Let's get some kills.

770
00:43:10,000 --> 00:43:12,000
Let's kill some bastards.

771
00:43:12,000 --> 00:43:14,000
Get on this point.

772
00:43:14,000 --> 00:43:17,000
Boys and girls.

773
00:43:17,000 --> 00:43:22,000
Where is he?

774
00:43:22,000 --> 00:43:25,000
You are a spy.

775
00:43:25,000 --> 00:43:26,000
Yep, he's here.

776
00:43:26,000 --> 00:43:31,000
It's invisible now.

777
00:43:31,000 --> 00:43:35,000
No, that was a total not good idea.

778
00:43:35,000 --> 00:43:38,000
Oh, what was...

779
00:43:38,000 --> 00:43:42,000
Did I jump in the air?

780
00:43:42,000 --> 00:43:48,000
Did what just happened to me?

781
00:43:49,000 --> 00:43:53,000
I don't even understand how that happened.

782
00:43:53,000 --> 00:43:55,000
Maybe I did jump.

783
00:43:55,000 --> 00:44:00,000
That was veered.

784
00:44:00,000 --> 00:44:02,000
Kill Jerma.

785
00:44:02,000 --> 00:44:08,000
Nice name.

786
00:44:08,000 --> 00:44:11,000
At least I got one kill.

787
00:44:11,000 --> 00:44:15,000
Tat around.

788
00:44:15,000 --> 00:44:21,000
Point.

789
00:44:21,000 --> 00:44:24,000
How do you open console?

790
00:44:24,000 --> 00:44:27,000
It's the Till Day key.

791
00:44:27,000 --> 00:44:33,000
Thing under escape.

792
00:44:33,000 --> 00:44:37,000
Oh, I got some expert rocket jumping, guys.

793
00:44:37,000 --> 00:44:39,000
Here we go.

794
00:44:39,000 --> 00:44:40,000
Expert.

795
00:44:40,000 --> 00:44:42,000
Rocket jumper.

796
00:44:42,000 --> 00:44:43,000
Check me out.

797
00:44:43,000 --> 00:44:50,000
I don't even know what the name of the site is.

798
00:44:50,000 --> 00:44:54,000
So wait, why would I give up TF2?

799
00:44:54,000 --> 00:45:01,000
I thought I made this explicitly clear that I never was.

800
00:45:01,000 --> 00:45:11,000
TF2 is a huge part of my existence.

801
00:45:11,000 --> 00:45:14,000
Oh, no.

802
00:45:14,000 --> 00:45:17,000
Where is auto?

803
00:45:17,000 --> 00:45:20,000
That's a good question.

804
00:45:20,000 --> 00:45:23,000
That's just my brain.

805
00:45:23,000 --> 00:45:26,000
What is that?

806
00:45:26,000 --> 00:45:29,000
Oh, that was awful.

807
00:45:29,000 --> 00:45:34,000
Here we go.

808
00:45:34,000 --> 00:45:40,000
Can I get like a string or two or three in a row here?

809
00:45:40,000 --> 00:45:47,000
Oh, come on.

810
00:45:47,000 --> 00:45:52,000
And you.

811
00:45:52,000 --> 00:45:56,000
All right.

812
00:45:56,000 --> 00:46:03,000
At least I'm killing people now.

813
00:46:03,000 --> 00:46:10,000
Oh, my Liberty Launcher is now a new rank.

814
00:46:10,000 --> 00:46:17,000
Yeah, I understand that phenomenal.

815
00:46:17,000 --> 00:46:21,000
But to be honest, the items that I have in my backpack right now,

816
00:46:21,000 --> 00:46:24,000
I mean, I know I can understand like, oh, he's giving away his whole backpack.

817
00:46:24,000 --> 00:46:26,000
He's going to quit.

818
00:46:26,000 --> 00:46:28,000
I understand that.

819
00:46:28,000 --> 00:46:31,000
But I mean, I have a lot of friends in Team Fortress.

820
00:46:31,000 --> 00:46:34,000
And a lot of people that, oh, God, hold on.

821
00:46:34,000 --> 00:46:38,000
Oh, God, I'm totally ruined that much.

822
00:46:38,000 --> 00:46:41,000
Oh, my God.

823
00:46:41,000 --> 00:46:43,000
But I've got a lot of friends in Team Fortress.

824
00:46:43,000 --> 00:46:46,000
And I have a lot of people that support me with this channel.

825
00:46:46,000 --> 00:46:49,000
So any item that I ever want to use, I can just get it back.

826
00:46:49,000 --> 00:46:51,000
It might not be strange.

827
00:46:51,000 --> 00:46:52,000
It might not be genuine.

828
00:46:52,000 --> 00:46:54,000
But that's, I don't care.

829
00:46:54,000 --> 00:46:57,000
I figured because, like I said in the video,

830
00:46:57,000 --> 00:47:00,000
I started with Team Fortress 2.

831
00:47:00,000 --> 00:47:04,000
And I got all the support from you guys, from Team Fortress.

832
00:47:04,000 --> 00:47:07,000
A lot of you guys are Team Fortress guys.

833
00:47:07,000 --> 00:47:10,000
And that was a decent shot.

834
00:47:10,000 --> 00:47:12,000
And that's why I felt like doing it, you know,

835
00:47:12,000 --> 00:47:14,000
something I felt like doing.

836
00:47:14,000 --> 00:47:15,000
And mine's made up.

837
00:47:15,000 --> 00:47:17,000
There's no going back now.

838
00:47:17,000 --> 00:47:19,000
So it's going to happen.

839
00:47:19,000 --> 00:47:23,000
And let's see if I can, no, there's a mini sector.

840
00:47:28,000 --> 00:47:31,000
All right, after this round,

841
00:47:31,000 --> 00:47:35,000
go to one more server and then I'm going to hop and drive to send.

842
00:47:41,000 --> 00:47:44,000
Boing, boing.

843
00:47:47,000 --> 00:47:50,000
No, that was laggy.

844
00:47:50,000 --> 00:47:53,000
Oh, I didn't want to do that.

845
00:47:53,000 --> 00:47:56,000
Oh, my God.

846
00:47:57,000 --> 00:48:01,000
What, what is it going on? That guy.

847
00:48:01,000 --> 00:48:05,000
The guy was just skydiving right there.

848
00:48:05,000 --> 00:48:07,000
Oh, I'm dead.

849
00:48:07,000 --> 00:48:10,000
I am so dead.

850
00:48:15,000 --> 00:48:17,000
Did it, did it, did it, did it.

851
00:48:17,000 --> 00:48:20,000
Oh, you lagged out? Yeah.

852
00:48:22,000 --> 00:48:25,000
Oh.

853
00:48:26,000 --> 00:48:28,000
Mission ends in 60 seconds.

854
00:48:28,000 --> 00:48:31,000
Mission ends in 60 seconds.

855
00:48:35,000 --> 00:48:38,000
Oh, how did I not hit him?

856
00:48:38,000 --> 00:48:41,000
Many centuries. Go out of here.

857
00:48:41,000 --> 00:48:44,000
Oh, there's a sniper. Good to know.

858
00:48:50,000 --> 00:48:53,000
Oh.

859
00:48:53,000 --> 00:48:56,000
This is where we're getting trouble.

860
00:48:56,000 --> 00:49:00,000
So, but it's snipers.

861
00:49:00,000 --> 00:49:03,000
He's still alive. Watch this spawn.

862
00:49:03,000 --> 00:49:06,000
Optimus Prime is on the loose.

863
00:49:09,000 --> 00:49:12,000
No, you're real.

864
00:49:12,000 --> 00:49:16,000
Where could he be?

865
00:49:16,000 --> 00:49:20,000
Gotta get on that point.

866
00:49:21,000 --> 00:49:23,000
Get on it.

867
00:49:23,000 --> 00:49:26,000
Everyone just stop on here right now.

868
00:49:26,000 --> 00:49:29,000
There we go.

869
00:49:29,000 --> 00:49:34,000
Ah, missed.

870
00:49:34,000 --> 00:49:39,000
One minute, 40 seconds. We got this.

871
00:49:40,000 --> 00:49:44,000
Hmm, you got a backup.

872
00:49:44,000 --> 00:49:46,000
Damn, every time I shoot a crit rocket,

873
00:49:46,000 --> 00:49:50,000
it just goes right by him.

874
00:49:50,000 --> 00:49:54,000
Track.

875
00:49:54,000 --> 00:49:59,000
Oh, oh.

876
00:49:59,000 --> 00:50:04,000
Oh, no, no, no.

877
00:50:05,000 --> 00:50:09,000
Oh, no, no, no.

878
00:50:09,000 --> 00:50:16,000
No, I just ruined this again.

879
00:50:16,000 --> 00:50:22,000
Oh, I'm sorry, medic. I'm an idiot.

880
00:50:22,000 --> 00:50:32,000
Oh.

881
00:50:32,000 --> 00:50:35,000
Yeah, tribes is a free to play game right now.

882
00:50:35,000 --> 00:50:37,000
I would suggest everyone to go get it.

883
00:50:37,000 --> 00:50:41,000
If you play team fortress, you'll probably like tribes.

884
00:50:41,000 --> 00:50:45,000
It's just another one of those kind of fast paced,

885
00:50:45,000 --> 00:50:48,000
you know, projectile based crazy fun games.

886
00:50:48,000 --> 00:50:51,000
FPS is the first version shooter.

887
00:50:51,000 --> 00:50:54,000
Nice, so let's set on New Sir.

888
00:50:54,000 --> 00:50:58,000
New Sir, have a...

889
00:50:58,000 --> 00:51:00,000
All right, one more server here.

890
00:51:00,000 --> 00:51:05,000
Then I'm going to hop into tribes for probably like a half an hour or so.

891
00:51:05,000 --> 00:51:17,000
So you're having 32.

892
00:51:17,000 --> 00:51:19,000
Okay, let's go to.

893
00:51:19,000 --> 00:51:23,000
We got this one is open and it's dustful.

894
00:51:23,000 --> 00:51:27,000
We just do we already did dustful.

895
00:51:27,000 --> 00:51:32,000
Well, busy town. That was busy town.

896
00:51:32,000 --> 00:51:36,000
This one's well. We can do well.

897
00:51:36,000 --> 00:51:40,000
I'm actually known and I know that server might not feel the...

898
00:51:40,000 --> 00:51:42,000
All right, we'll go to this one.

899
00:51:42,000 --> 00:51:44,000
CTF well.

900
00:51:44,000 --> 00:51:45,000
And there you are.

901
00:51:45,000 --> 00:51:56,000
Everyone join it.

902
00:51:56,000 --> 00:52:01,000
Empty randomizer.

903
00:52:01,000 --> 00:52:06,000
I mean, randomizer.

904
00:52:06,000 --> 00:52:09,000
Is it really empty?

905
00:52:09,000 --> 00:52:19,000
So those servers are like legit empty right now?

906
00:52:19,000 --> 00:52:21,000
No, okay.

907
00:52:21,000 --> 00:52:26,000
Next week we'll do randomizer.

908
00:52:26,000 --> 00:52:33,000
We'll do some randomizer next week.

909
00:52:33,000 --> 00:52:38,000
I'm going to use the shortstop and the...

910
00:52:38,000 --> 00:52:40,000
I'm going to put on the whole set.

911
00:52:40,000 --> 00:52:45,000
Why not, right? Why not?

912
00:52:51,000 --> 00:52:56,000
Oh, the rounds have not even started.

913
00:52:56,000 --> 00:52:59,000
I'm going to get a kill.

914
00:52:59,000 --> 00:53:04,000
No, I'm not. Too bad.

915
00:53:04,000 --> 00:53:06,000
Woohoo!

916
00:53:06,000 --> 00:53:08,000
I'm going to sneeze. I got a sneeze.

917
00:53:08,000 --> 00:53:10,000
There's nothing I can do about it.

918
00:53:10,000 --> 00:53:13,000
Oh, I'm going to sneeze.

919
00:53:13,000 --> 00:53:15,000
No. No, I'm false alarm.

920
00:53:15,000 --> 00:53:16,000
No.

921
00:53:16,000 --> 00:53:18,000
Oh, man.

922
00:53:18,000 --> 00:53:23,000
Sorry. There's no button I can press to mute me.

923
00:53:23,000 --> 00:53:27,000
Are we getting spawn traps? What's going on?

924
00:53:27,000 --> 00:53:32,000
Thank you.

925
00:53:32,000 --> 00:53:36,000
Monarch!

926
00:53:36,000 --> 00:53:44,000
Get me in here.

927
00:53:44,000 --> 00:53:49,000
Oh, I'm scared. I got to get crits.

928
00:53:49,000 --> 00:53:56,000
Oh, damn.

929
00:53:56,000 --> 00:53:59,000
It's the Vizzi spider.

930
00:53:59,000 --> 00:54:01,000
One of the water spouts.

931
00:54:01,000 --> 00:54:03,000
Down came the rain.

932
00:54:03,000 --> 00:54:08,000
And wiped out that goddamn spider.

933
00:54:08,000 --> 00:54:12,000
I just bumped into a spider, but I don't care.

934
00:54:12,000 --> 00:54:17,000
Oh, it didn't wake me.

935
00:54:17,000 --> 00:54:24,000
Oh, man. I did help.

936
00:54:24,000 --> 00:54:32,000
Oh, you are not. You are a real bowl.

937
00:54:32,000 --> 00:54:35,000
He's still alive.

938
00:54:35,000 --> 00:54:38,000
No, he's not. Wait, what?

939
00:54:38,000 --> 00:54:43,000
I was actually killed.

940
00:54:43,000 --> 00:54:49,000
There's the hell. That's what I wanted.

941
00:54:49,000 --> 00:54:56,000
Oh, God no.

942
00:54:56,000 --> 00:54:58,000
This is bounced off the door.

943
00:54:58,000 --> 00:55:04,000
I can't get me to face.

944
00:55:04,000 --> 00:55:10,000
Oh, come on away.

945
00:55:10,000 --> 00:55:16,000
Give me my milk. Give me my milk.

946
00:55:16,000 --> 00:55:22,000
All right, several levels. Thanks for coming, man.

947
00:55:22,000 --> 00:55:26,000
Well, I ever do more dual commentary. So hell yeah.

948
00:55:26,000 --> 00:55:29,000
I just did one the other night.

949
00:55:29,000 --> 00:55:40,000
On CS go with MLC still.

950
00:55:40,000 --> 00:55:43,000
Oh, just just jump over everybody trying to get around.

951
00:55:43,000 --> 00:55:48,000
Oh, I was going to buy this rain.

952
00:55:48,000 --> 00:55:51,000
Give me out of here. Give me a lamp.

953
00:55:51,000 --> 00:55:57,000
Come on. Give me the stupid intelligence.

954
00:55:57,000 --> 00:56:10,000
D-A-M-M damn damn.

955
00:56:10,000 --> 00:56:13,000
Oh, what just go?

956
00:56:13,000 --> 00:56:25,000
I got backstabbed. Gang it.

957
00:56:25,000 --> 00:56:28,000
Special delivery.

958
00:56:28,000 --> 00:56:35,000
All right.

959
00:56:35,000 --> 00:56:39,000
Was this in low right?

960
00:56:39,000 --> 00:56:42,000
All we got a troll.

961
00:56:42,000 --> 00:56:49,000
We got a troll.

962
00:56:49,000 --> 00:56:52,000
All right.

963
00:56:52,000 --> 00:56:56,000
One more round of this.

964
00:56:56,000 --> 00:57:00,000
I'm going to go viral this time.

965
00:57:00,000 --> 00:57:03,000
I always do not.

966
00:57:03,000 --> 00:57:09,000
I don't put on it. Let's go.

967
00:57:09,000 --> 00:57:13,000
All right. Last round.

968
00:57:13,000 --> 00:57:24,000
Damn.

969
00:57:24,000 --> 00:57:30,000
No. All right. I got to clear offline.

970
00:57:30,000 --> 00:57:39,000
We can't have any spam coming at me, especially what it has bad, bad things.

971
00:57:39,000 --> 00:57:47,000
Oh, no, no, no, no.

972
00:57:47,000 --> 00:57:51,000
Somebody behind us still?

973
00:57:51,000 --> 00:58:00,000
No, I tried to solve a goddamn trade.

974
00:58:00,000 --> 00:58:05,000
I don't think I even have the half of the degreaser said to be honest.

975
00:58:05,000 --> 00:58:09,000
No, I don't have the half.

976
00:58:09,000 --> 00:58:20,000
You know, I saw I thought I could get by and then I turned and skid the crap out of myself.

977
00:58:20,000 --> 00:58:22,000
Oh my god. They have crits.

978
00:58:22,000 --> 00:58:26,000
Shoot at me. Come on.

979
00:58:26,000 --> 00:58:31,000
All right. Don't get to put the trade again.

980
00:58:31,000 --> 00:58:40,000
I almost got hit by the trade again.

981
00:58:40,000 --> 00:58:47,000
No, I'm going to make it. Oh, damn it.

982
00:58:47,000 --> 00:58:55,000
Where's Burger Boy?

983
00:58:56,000 --> 00:59:02,000
Where is Burger Boy?

984
00:59:02,000 --> 00:59:08,000
How am I not letting him on fire?

985
00:59:08,000 --> 00:59:12,000
Oh, is that mean we're going to play tribes ascent with Burger Boy?

986
00:59:12,000 --> 00:59:21,000
Special guest appearance from Burger Boy?

987
00:59:21,000 --> 00:59:25,000
God damn it, Burger Boy. Reveal yourself.

988
00:59:25,000 --> 00:59:28,000
He has.

989
00:59:28,000 --> 00:59:32,000
Burger Boy, Burger Boy's been in videos.

990
00:59:32,000 --> 00:59:37,000
Oh, I'm out of ammo.

991
00:59:37,000 --> 00:59:40,000
Oh, god.

992
00:59:40,000 --> 00:59:46,000
Oh, my power jack. Would I get one kill with it?

993
00:59:46,000 --> 00:59:49,000
All right, train. Me versus you.

994
00:59:49,000 --> 00:59:55,000
I say, buddy, let's do this.

995
00:59:55,000 --> 00:59:58,000
I lost.

996
00:59:58,000 --> 01:00:11,000
Oh, we got crits. Yes.

997
01:00:11,000 --> 01:00:15,000
I just want to crit fire somebody.

998
01:00:15,000 --> 01:00:23,000
Feels good to crit fire.

999
01:00:23,000 --> 01:00:26,000
It feels good to crit fire.

1000
01:00:26,000 --> 01:00:29,000
All right, we're going sniper.

1001
01:00:29,000 --> 01:00:36,000
No, we're not. I'm going heavy.

1002
01:00:36,000 --> 01:00:39,000
Run, run, run, run, run, run, run.

1003
01:00:39,000 --> 01:00:44,000
Get away. Oh, come on. Right when I get a spawn.

1004
01:00:44,000 --> 01:00:55,000
B-U-L-L-S-H-I-T with six exclamation points after that.

1005
01:00:55,000 --> 01:00:59,000
Wait, why do I have to attach it equipped?

1006
01:00:59,000 --> 01:01:06,000
Okay, whatever.

1007
01:01:06,000 --> 01:01:10,000
I'm so scared. I killed this five from like 5,000 feet away.

1008
01:01:10,000 --> 01:01:14,000
All right, where is this guy? Oh, my god.

1009
01:01:14,000 --> 01:01:18,000
He's on the roof. I thought it was to the right.

1010
01:01:18,000 --> 01:01:22,000
I take this stupid thing off. Give me the regular gun.

1011
01:01:30,000 --> 01:01:35,000
B-B-B-B-B-B-B-B.

1012
01:01:35,000 --> 01:01:38,000
I got to really watch my back now.

1013
01:01:38,000 --> 01:01:45,000
Playing heavy. Probably the worst idea I could have ever done.

1014
01:01:45,000 --> 01:01:48,000
I'm going to be on fire.

1015
01:01:48,000 --> 01:01:51,000
Oh, thank you so much.

1016
01:01:51,000 --> 01:01:57,000
Oh, no, here comes another dude.

1017
01:01:57,000 --> 01:01:59,000
How are you still alive?

1018
01:01:59,000 --> 01:02:04,000
What? I can't find the trade again.

1019
01:02:04,000 --> 01:02:11,000
Of course I can hit by the trade again.

1020
01:02:11,000 --> 01:02:14,000
That would absolutely happen.

1021
01:02:14,000 --> 01:02:18,000
Oh, full of god.

1022
01:02:18,000 --> 01:02:22,000
Hey, we're going to get Chris, I think.

1023
01:02:22,000 --> 01:02:25,000
I hope we get Chris right now.

1024
01:02:25,000 --> 01:02:31,000
Oh, my god. Of course, we get Chris that I've done. I'm dead.

1025
01:02:35,000 --> 01:02:41,000
Oh, take this off. Take this. Take that.

1026
01:02:41,000 --> 01:02:51,000
How are you still alive?

1027
01:02:51,000 --> 01:02:55,000
I knew it. I knew it was a guy behind us.

1028
01:02:55,000 --> 01:03:00,000
Oh, my god. 32 person servers are just like ridiculous.

1029
01:03:00,000 --> 01:03:03,000
They are like insane.

1030
01:03:03,000 --> 01:03:05,000
Insanity.

1031
01:03:05,000 --> 01:03:10,000
They give up the drone. It's just like, oh, shit.

1032
01:03:10,000 --> 01:03:15,000
Where is this guy?

1033
01:03:15,000 --> 01:03:17,000
So scared of the spy just facts.

1034
01:03:17,000 --> 01:03:24,000
I mean, it's definitely going to happen right now.

1035
01:03:24,000 --> 01:03:28,000
Oh, get it by the trade again.

1036
01:03:28,000 --> 01:03:31,000
Oh, my god.

1037
01:03:31,000 --> 01:03:33,000
Oh, we won. How do we win?

1038
01:03:33,000 --> 01:03:38,000
How am I in the number two right now?

1039
01:03:38,000 --> 01:03:45,000
All right. Well, good night if you leave it, man.

1040
01:03:45,000 --> 01:03:47,000
Thanks for coming.

1041
01:03:47,000 --> 01:03:50,000
So now I'm going to head on to tribes.

1042
01:03:50,000 --> 01:03:58,000
A sent time dudes and dudeettes.

1043
01:03:58,000 --> 01:04:01,000
Thanks for playing everybody.

1044
01:04:01,000 --> 01:04:04,000
All right.

1045
01:04:04,000 --> 01:04:12,000
So I think I might invite a few people into the call that have tribes.

1046
01:04:12,000 --> 01:04:17,000
See how that goes.

1047
01:04:17,000 --> 01:04:19,000
I got to change this to Sam.

1048
01:04:19,000 --> 01:04:21,000
Might tell him to do that in a minute.

1049
01:04:21,000 --> 01:04:22,000
Let me open up tribes.

1050
01:04:22,000 --> 01:04:25,000
The screen Michael Black for a second, guys.

1051
01:04:25,000 --> 01:04:29,000
So I apologize.

1052
01:04:29,000 --> 01:04:34,000
The screen is going to go black.

1053
01:04:34,000 --> 01:04:42,000
So bear with me for one second while I load up tribes as sent.

1054
01:04:42,000 --> 01:04:45,000
Oh, I have ADHD. Crazy bad.

1055
01:04:45,000 --> 01:04:50,000
I have really bad ADHD.

1056
01:04:50,000 --> 01:04:52,000
I'm sure my is dead.

1057
01:04:52,000 --> 01:04:54,000
I'm still here.

1058
01:04:54,000 --> 01:05:02,000
To talk this, it's all I see.

1059
01:05:02,000 --> 01:05:05,000
I already did a set up video, Hannibal.

1060
01:05:05,000 --> 01:05:08,000
Go to my 4000 subscriber video.

1061
01:05:08,000 --> 01:05:11,000
It should be there.

1062
01:05:11,000 --> 01:05:13,000
Don't go into the light.

1063
01:05:13,000 --> 01:05:15,000
Now my children.

1064
01:05:15,000 --> 01:05:17,000
Let me tell you something.

1065
01:05:17,000 --> 01:05:21,000
I am God coming to you from the black screen.

1066
01:05:21,000 --> 01:05:25,000
Let me tell you all you need to do to have a good fun, interesting life.

1067
01:05:25,000 --> 01:05:33,000
Is to crash because that's what I think I just did.

1068
01:05:33,000 --> 01:05:35,000
Oh, no, no, I'm here.

1069
01:05:35,000 --> 01:05:36,000
Okay, okay.

1070
01:05:36,000 --> 01:05:38,000
I really thought it is hard crash right there.

1071
01:05:38,000 --> 01:05:42,000
That would have been bad.

1072
01:05:42,000 --> 01:05:43,000
All right.

1073
01:05:43,000 --> 01:05:45,000
Let me get into the game.

1074
01:05:45,000 --> 01:05:52,000
The screen should come back in about 10 seconds, guys.

1075
01:05:52,000 --> 01:05:55,000
Settings.

1076
01:05:55,000 --> 01:05:56,000
Audio.

1077
01:05:56,000 --> 01:05:58,000
Yeah, that's fine.

1078
01:05:58,000 --> 01:05:59,000
Video.

1079
01:05:59,000 --> 01:06:00,000
Window.

1080
01:06:00,000 --> 01:06:02,000
Come on, let's go window.

1081
01:06:02,000 --> 01:06:03,000
Windowed.

1082
01:06:03,000 --> 01:06:04,000
All right.

1083
01:06:04,000 --> 01:06:08,000
Now I'm coming back.

1084
01:06:08,000 --> 01:06:14,000
Change the resolution.

1085
01:06:14,000 --> 01:06:16,000
All right.

1086
01:06:16,000 --> 01:06:20,000
Let me just add this game as a source into the exploit.

1087
01:06:20,000 --> 01:06:24,000
Should be good to go.

1088
01:06:24,000 --> 01:06:25,000
Game.

1089
01:06:25,000 --> 01:06:28,000
Hello.

1090
01:06:28,000 --> 01:06:30,000
Is that going to fit?

1091
01:06:30,000 --> 01:06:31,000
Is that work?

1092
01:06:31,000 --> 01:06:33,000
Let's see.

1093
01:06:33,000 --> 01:06:36,000
I think that fits.

1094
01:06:36,000 --> 01:06:41,000
Pretty sure at least.

1095
01:06:41,000 --> 01:06:43,000
Get that out of the way.

1096
01:06:43,000 --> 01:06:45,000
What's with the double screen?

1097
01:06:45,000 --> 01:06:50,000
That's weird.

1098
01:06:50,000 --> 01:06:54,000
Hmm.

1099
01:06:54,000 --> 01:06:56,000
Hold on a second, guys.

1100
01:06:56,000 --> 01:06:57,000
I'm going to change this.

1101
01:06:57,000 --> 01:06:58,000
This is a little glitchy.

1102
01:06:58,000 --> 01:07:05,000
I'm just going to add the screen region.

1103
01:07:05,000 --> 01:07:07,000
That should be better.

1104
01:07:07,000 --> 01:07:10,000
Okay, yeah, there we go.

1105
01:07:10,000 --> 01:07:11,000
All right.

1106
01:07:11,000 --> 01:07:18,000
So that should be better.

1107
01:07:18,000 --> 01:07:19,000
All right.

1108
01:07:19,000 --> 01:07:29,000
So I think we're going to get some people in here to talk while we play.

1109
01:07:29,000 --> 01:07:35,000
Those of you that have never played this game, please, my goodness, please go, please go download it.

1110
01:07:35,000 --> 01:07:37,000
It is an unbelievable game.

1111
01:07:37,000 --> 01:07:39,000
And it's free.

1112
01:07:39,000 --> 01:07:44,000
What are the reasons you need to move this?

1113
01:07:44,000 --> 01:07:50,000
It's not the way.

1114
01:07:50,000 --> 01:07:54,000
To the left, to the right, to the right.

1115
01:07:54,000 --> 01:08:05,000
I need to be moved a little bit.

1116
01:08:05,000 --> 01:08:08,000
All right.

1117
01:08:08,000 --> 01:08:15,000
It looks like it's centered, at least on my screen.

1118
01:08:15,000 --> 01:08:16,000
All right.

1119
01:08:16,000 --> 01:08:20,000
So we're going to get anybody in this call?

1120
01:08:20,000 --> 01:08:22,000
Maybe.

1121
01:08:22,000 --> 01:08:26,000
What happened to the audio?

1122
01:08:26,000 --> 01:08:28,000
Audio still here?

1123
01:08:28,000 --> 01:08:31,000
Yeah, it's here.

1124
01:08:31,000 --> 01:08:33,000
All right.

1125
01:08:33,000 --> 01:08:36,000
Somebody call me on Skype so we can start a call.

1126
01:08:36,000 --> 01:08:39,000
I'm going to call a booth or stealth or a burger boy.

1127
01:08:39,000 --> 01:08:45,000
Okay, but one of you guys wants to do this thing and then just join up.

1128
01:08:45,000 --> 01:08:47,000
They might have already been calling.

1129
01:08:47,000 --> 01:08:50,000
Yeah, they are.

1130
01:08:50,000 --> 01:08:53,000
What's up, burger boy?

1131
01:08:53,000 --> 01:08:54,000
Oh, burger boy.

1132
01:08:54,000 --> 01:08:55,000
Now burger boys call me.

1133
01:08:55,000 --> 01:08:56,000
Get out of here.

1134
01:08:56,000 --> 01:08:59,000
I'm inviting them this one.

1135
01:08:59,000 --> 01:09:00,000
Is that his door?

1136
01:09:00,000 --> 01:09:02,000
I was first.

1137
01:09:02,000 --> 01:09:03,000
But about, what about it?

1138
01:09:03,000 --> 01:09:04,000
Where's the talcs?

1139
01:09:04,000 --> 01:09:05,000
Maybe the talcs will play.

1140
01:09:05,000 --> 01:09:06,000
It was offline.

1141
01:09:06,000 --> 01:09:08,000
He might be doing a band thing or an after.

1142
01:09:08,000 --> 01:09:12,000
Oh, what's up, burger boy?

1143
01:09:12,000 --> 01:09:15,000
Make sure you guys are turning off.

1144
01:09:15,000 --> 01:09:17,000
I'll try to stream off.

1145
01:09:17,000 --> 01:09:18,000
Okay.

1146
01:09:18,000 --> 01:09:19,000
All right.

1147
01:09:19,000 --> 01:09:24,000
If somebody else wants to join, can you guys monitor or stealth can you monitor just in case I'm like in the game?

1148
01:09:24,000 --> 01:09:25,000
Yeah, do it.

1149
01:09:25,000 --> 01:09:26,000
What's happening?

1150
01:09:26,000 --> 01:09:32,000
I'm just saying, like, when I alt tab in a window, it's just like, explode.

1151
01:09:32,000 --> 01:09:38,000
So like, I can't like really alt tab anymore.

1152
01:09:38,000 --> 01:09:39,000
But I want to pull the ball.

1153
01:09:39,000 --> 01:09:42,000
I mean, you could play the game just every, like, 10 seconds.

1154
01:09:42,000 --> 01:09:46,000
Just check this.

1155
01:09:46,000 --> 01:09:53,000
So if you want, it's going to be difficult to join the game off me right now because the way this game works is you have to have like a,

1156
01:09:53,000 --> 01:09:55,000
I don't know how many friends you can have to be honest.

1157
01:09:55,000 --> 01:09:57,000
I really don't know.

1158
01:09:57,000 --> 01:10:01,000
But I'm going to go pathfinder.

1159
01:10:01,000 --> 01:10:02,000
I'm going to turn this up.

1160
01:10:02,000 --> 01:10:04,000
The stream is under control.

1161
01:10:04,000 --> 01:10:06,000
I'm going to stand in the end.

1162
01:10:06,000 --> 01:10:08,000
The stream is under control and I'm going to turn this up.

1163
01:10:08,000 --> 01:10:11,000
Turn this up.

1164
01:10:11,000 --> 01:10:13,000
Because you can't hear it.

1165
01:10:13,000 --> 01:10:14,000
All right.

1166
01:10:14,000 --> 01:10:16,000
I think we can go with sound on the stream.

1167
01:10:16,000 --> 01:10:17,000
Should be.

1168
01:10:17,000 --> 01:10:19,000
Hey, burger boy, do you have drugs or something?

1169
01:10:19,000 --> 01:10:21,000
Oh, he's got it.

1170
01:10:21,000 --> 01:10:23,000
He's absolutely got it.

1171
01:10:23,000 --> 01:10:28,000
So this game, if you don't know what this is, if you're like, what the hell are you doing right now?

1172
01:10:28,000 --> 01:10:39,000
This game is pretty much think of team fortress meets quake meets skiing meets ski free meets windows 95 meets windows 98.

1173
01:10:39,000 --> 01:10:42,000
I'm not sure if that made any sense, but this game is just look at this.

1174
01:10:42,000 --> 01:10:44,000
Just chaos.

1175
01:10:44,000 --> 01:10:50,000
Pretty much think of this game as your you play as a soldier like a Liberty launch of soldier and that's pretty much what everyone is using.

1176
01:10:50,000 --> 01:10:52,000
And you ski around like a hundred miles per hour.

1177
01:10:52,000 --> 01:10:54,000
It's all about momentum.

1178
01:10:54,000 --> 01:10:57,000
And we just really won the game.

1179
01:10:57,000 --> 01:10:59,000
Yeah, that's a good way to put it.

1180
01:10:59,000 --> 01:11:07,000
This game is halo with speed hacks and cooler mechanics in my opinion.

1181
01:11:07,000 --> 01:11:14,000
The music is cool.

1182
01:11:14,000 --> 01:11:17,000
I agree with one germ.

1183
01:11:17,000 --> 01:11:19,000
Nice change.

1184
01:11:19,000 --> 01:11:22,000
Change to go to map.

1185
01:11:22,000 --> 01:11:24,000
But it's not really halo.

1186
01:11:24,000 --> 01:11:27,000
It's like a.

1187
01:11:27,000 --> 01:11:31,000
It's cool in my opinion just because I never really played a lot.

1188
01:11:31,000 --> 01:11:33,000
I never had an Xbox.

1189
01:11:33,000 --> 01:11:34,000
You never could play.

1190
01:11:34,000 --> 01:11:36,000
I had an Xbox at a 360.

1191
01:11:36,000 --> 01:11:42,000
One.

1192
01:11:42,000 --> 01:11:45,000
Two or three years ago was the last time I had one.

1193
01:11:45,000 --> 01:11:46,000
What's going on?

1194
01:11:46,000 --> 01:11:48,000
Why am I stuck here?

1195
01:11:48,000 --> 01:11:52,000
I'm stuck in this lobby area.

1196
01:11:52,000 --> 01:11:57,000
There we go.

1197
01:11:57,000 --> 01:11:58,000
So it was lagging right this.

1198
01:11:58,000 --> 01:12:00,000
Rhyme was lagging.

1199
01:12:00,000 --> 01:12:07,000
You kidding me?

1200
01:12:07,000 --> 01:12:09,000
Let me know if it keeps happening.

1201
01:12:09,000 --> 01:12:13,000
Try this again.

1202
01:12:13,000 --> 01:12:16,000
It keeps happening.

1203
01:12:16,000 --> 01:12:23,000
Change to couple settings.

1204
01:12:23,000 --> 01:12:27,000
But once you get lagging on a date, this game is so satisfying.

1205
01:12:27,000 --> 01:12:30,000
I'm going bloody eagle.

1206
01:12:30,000 --> 01:12:33,000
You can get some real satisfying kills within this game.

1207
01:12:33,000 --> 01:12:37,000
Especially because it's all about a long range.

1208
01:12:37,000 --> 01:12:38,000
Long range and people.

1209
01:12:38,000 --> 01:12:40,000
Did you quit and joined a different game?

1210
01:12:40,000 --> 01:12:41,000
I did.

1211
01:12:41,000 --> 01:12:44,000
I did.

1212
01:12:44,000 --> 01:12:47,000
I did.

1213
01:12:47,000 --> 01:12:51,000
I did.

1214
01:12:51,000 --> 01:12:54,000
I don't know.

1215
01:12:54,000 --> 01:12:56,000
It's a lot of key.

1216
01:12:56,000 --> 01:12:59,000
It's burger boys like not a lot of play.

1217
01:12:59,000 --> 01:13:01,000
How did I not kill that guy?

1218
01:13:01,000 --> 01:13:03,000
There we go.

1219
01:13:03,000 --> 01:13:10,000
This is a beta.

1220
01:13:10,000 --> 01:13:13,000
It's free though.

1221
01:13:13,000 --> 01:13:16,000
Open beta.

1222
01:13:16,000 --> 01:13:19,000
Did that free crit?

1223
01:13:19,000 --> 01:13:23,000
You get three shots.

1224
01:13:23,000 --> 01:13:26,000
The pathfinder is like the scout.

1225
01:13:26,000 --> 01:13:30,000
Soldiers like the soldier.

1226
01:13:30,000 --> 01:13:33,000
I guess.

1227
01:13:33,000 --> 01:13:36,000
There's like nine classes in this game.

1228
01:13:36,000 --> 01:13:39,000
This is just team deathmatch.

1229
01:13:39,000 --> 01:13:42,000
What?

1230
01:13:42,000 --> 01:13:45,000
Why do we split the hell?

1231
01:13:45,000 --> 01:13:48,000
I'll keep joining again.

1232
01:13:48,000 --> 01:13:51,000
I'll keep this winning.

1233
01:13:51,000 --> 01:13:54,000
I'll go.

1234
01:13:54,000 --> 01:13:57,000
I do not quit this one.

1235
01:13:57,000 --> 01:14:00,000
Keep staying.

1236
01:14:00,000 --> 01:14:04,000
But you see this up here.

1237
01:14:04,000 --> 01:14:07,000
You see this up here, right?

1238
01:14:07,000 --> 01:14:10,000
You can buy items and buy them.

1239
01:14:10,000 --> 01:14:14,000
If you don't want to buy them, you can buy items.

1240
01:14:14,000 --> 01:14:18,000
If you don't want to wait and unlock them, it's kind of like that.

1241
01:14:18,000 --> 01:14:21,000
If you want to spend money, you can.

1242
01:14:21,000 --> 01:14:27,000
But if you don't, it takes a long time to get all the items.

1243
01:14:27,000 --> 01:14:33,000
That's like an exaggerated long time.

1244
01:14:33,000 --> 01:14:57,000
I'm going to turn the graphics down a tiny bit because I think people were saying it was lagging.

1245
01:14:57,000 --> 01:15:21,000
I'm going to turn the graphics down a tiny bit.

1246
01:15:21,000 --> 01:15:45,000
I'm going to turn the graphics down a tiny bit.

1247
01:15:45,000 --> 01:16:09,000
I'm going to turn the graphics down a tiny bit.

1248
01:16:09,000 --> 01:16:33,000
I'm going to turn the graphics down a tiny bit.

1249
01:16:33,000 --> 01:16:45,000
Oh, you're on the enemy team, huh?

1250
01:16:45,000 --> 01:16:57,000
Oh, come on. Let's go out 1v1, baby.

1251
01:16:57,000 --> 01:17:15,000
Oh, look at all those people in that.

1252
01:17:15,000 --> 01:17:39,000
Oh, I get a nice sniper rifle.

1253
01:17:39,000 --> 01:17:59,000
Oh, come on now.

1254
01:17:59,000 --> 01:18:17,000
Oh, protect me.

1255
01:18:17,000 --> 01:18:33,000
Oh, come on.

1256
01:18:33,000 --> 01:18:45,000
Oh, there's a flag.

1257
01:18:45,000 --> 01:19:05,000
I just totally sniped that flag.

1258
01:19:05,000 --> 01:19:25,000
Oh, there's a flag.

1259
01:19:25,000 --> 01:19:45,000
Let me drag it to Alex and do your...

1260
01:19:45,000 --> 01:20:05,000
Oh, there's a flag.

1261
01:20:05,000 --> 01:20:25,000
Oh, I can't even figure out how to switch teams.

1262
01:20:25,000 --> 01:20:35,000
Oh, wait, you first pee.

1263
01:20:35,000 --> 01:20:43,000
Oh, this guy is so toast right now.

1264
01:20:43,000 --> 01:20:57,000
Oh, come on.

1265
01:20:57,000 --> 01:21:11,000
Oh, stealthy.

1266
01:21:11,000 --> 01:21:29,000
Oh, there's a bird.

1267
01:21:29,000 --> 01:21:59,000
Oh, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no

1268
01:21:59,000 --> 01:22:05,000
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no man, no, it's news and new Kei is Stateseps, it's news and new Keisichi.

1269
01:22:05,000 --> 01:22:10,000
It's a bundle, but he also has North Korea going kung fu-kwang.

1270
01:22:10,000 --> 01:22:12,000
He's his boy.

1271
01:22:12,000 --> 01:22:16,000
I think he's lost and he did, you bet and now he writes.

1272
01:22:16,000 --> 01:22:21,000
And he says North Korean in JavaScript andlace movies.

1273
01:22:21,000 --> 01:22:26,000
He has children, he has children and they say New Wanna One, y'all.

1274
01:22:26,000 --> 01:22:31,000
phone. Try and get on this team, Bergen Boyd, the insensitive one.

1275
01:22:31,000 --> 01:22:31,000
All right.

1276
01:22:34,000 --> 01:22:36,000
Let's see if any of us made any of the MVP statistics.

1277
01:22:36,000 --> 01:22:37,000
No, we sure didn't.

1278
01:22:38,000 --> 01:22:41,000
Yeah, you got a MLC still flag held top accolade.

1279
01:22:42,000 --> 01:22:45,000
Well, you got like a top metal.

1280
01:22:45,000 --> 01:22:46,000
You didn't get a MVP.

1281
01:22:48,000 --> 01:22:51,000
I say I'm going to actually you got two you got two medals.

1282
01:22:52,000 --> 01:22:54,000
Flag held and flag killer.

1283
01:22:54,000 --> 01:22:57,000
Top accolades.

1284
01:22:57,000 --> 01:23:00,000
This thing is my most flag held medals is 41.

1285
01:23:00,000 --> 01:23:04,000
And that's because I got the flag right when the game started and I skied around for 10 minutes.

1286
01:23:04,000 --> 01:23:05,000
What did it?

1287
01:23:05,000 --> 01:23:09,000
Why am I not logged into my own stream right now?

1288
01:23:09,000 --> 01:23:12,000
I just typed something. How's that possible?

1289
01:23:15,000 --> 01:23:19,000
So it's oh playing team fortress two when I'm absolutely not.

1290
01:23:22,000 --> 01:23:24,000
Do you want my delegate?

1291
01:23:24,000 --> 01:23:25,000
What do you do on bloody?

1292
01:23:28,000 --> 01:23:29,000
Yeah, go go right when you can.

1293
01:23:31,000 --> 01:23:33,000
Is that Bergen Boyd just like click spamming?

1294
01:23:37,000 --> 01:23:39,000
As your best chance.

1295
01:23:39,000 --> 01:23:40,000
Oh, no.

1296
01:23:42,000 --> 01:23:44,000
Are we going to get split up here?

1297
01:23:44,000 --> 01:23:45,000
And click faster.

1298
01:23:45,000 --> 01:23:46,000
I think we might get split up here.

1299
01:23:47,000 --> 01:23:48,000
What up?

1300
01:23:48,000 --> 01:23:49,000
I'll catch you guys.

1301
01:23:49,000 --> 01:23:50,000
Oh, I just made it.

1302
01:23:51,000 --> 01:23:52,000
Oh, Bergen Boyd.

1303
01:23:55,000 --> 01:23:56,000
You could have stayed up.

1304
01:23:56,000 --> 01:23:57,000
I did.

1305
01:23:57,000 --> 01:23:58,000
Yeah, I just waited.

1306
01:23:58,000 --> 01:23:59,000
You made it?

1307
01:23:59,000 --> 01:24:00,000
I made it.

1308
01:24:02,000 --> 01:24:03,000
Anything else to fly?

1309
01:24:03,000 --> 01:24:06,000
No, I got to change this to say I'm playing tribes.

1310
01:24:08,000 --> 01:24:10,000
Try this end.

1311
01:24:10,000 --> 01:24:12,000
There we go.

1312
01:24:14,000 --> 01:24:16,000
Broadcast updated successfully.

1313
01:24:17,000 --> 01:24:18,000
Oh, got the flag.

1314
01:24:20,000 --> 01:24:22,000
Probably not for long.

1315
01:24:22,000 --> 01:24:24,000
I'm going to go soldiers this time.

1316
01:24:26,000 --> 01:24:28,000
I think that's the best idea.

1317
01:24:29,000 --> 01:24:31,000
Wow, there is no one on my team over here at all.

1318
01:24:32,000 --> 01:24:34,000
Trying to tell it's there.

1319
01:24:34,000 --> 01:24:34,000
Behind you.

1320
01:24:35,000 --> 01:24:36,000
Nice.

1321
01:24:36,000 --> 01:24:37,000
Air shot.

1322
01:24:39,000 --> 01:24:40,000
Oh, Bergen Boyd made it.

1323
01:24:42,000 --> 01:24:43,000
All right, let's keep going.

1324
01:24:43,000 --> 01:24:44,000
All right, I got to see you now.

1325
01:24:44,000 --> 01:24:46,000
I got to go buy an arcs and buster.

1326
01:24:46,000 --> 01:24:47,000
Whatever that is.

1327
01:24:47,000 --> 01:24:50,000
Oh, it's probably stupid.

1328
01:24:51,000 --> 01:24:52,000
Yeah.

1329
01:24:52,000 --> 01:24:53,000
Oh, you bastard.

1330
01:24:53,000 --> 01:24:53,000
Where are you doing?

1331
01:24:54,000 --> 01:24:56,000
I'm trying to go as a sweet under the bridge.

1332
01:24:57,000 --> 01:24:58,000
Flight right there.

1333
01:24:59,000 --> 01:25:01,000
Oh, you want to go assault rifle on assault rifle or something?

1334
01:25:03,000 --> 01:25:03,000
Oh, yeah.

1335
01:25:04,000 --> 01:25:05,000
Oh, this guy needs one hidden.

1336
01:25:05,000 --> 01:25:06,000
He's dead.

1337
01:25:08,000 --> 01:25:09,000
Oh, come on.

1338
01:25:09,000 --> 01:25:09,000
Fine.

1339
01:25:09,000 --> 01:25:10,000
Thump up.

1340
01:25:11,000 --> 01:25:12,000
There we go.

1341
01:25:12,000 --> 01:25:13,000
There we go.

1342
01:25:16,000 --> 01:25:18,000
All right, who's got the flag?

1343
01:25:18,000 --> 01:25:18,000
Uh-oh.

1344
01:25:18,000 --> 01:25:22,000
They're going to catch me now right into like the border of like at the edge of the map over here.

1345
01:25:23,000 --> 01:25:25,000
Did we get the flag yesterday or flag?

1346
01:25:25,000 --> 01:25:26,000
Yeah, we do.

1347
01:25:26,000 --> 01:25:28,000
And yeah, Talix has two evil men chasing him.

1348
01:25:28,000 --> 01:25:30,000
Hi, let's get over there.

1349
01:25:30,000 --> 01:25:32,000
Got some ninjas flying around behind me trying to get over.

1350
01:25:32,000 --> 01:25:33,000
I don't want to do chasing it.

1351
01:25:33,000 --> 01:25:35,000
Oh, Talix's voice is smooth.

1352
01:25:35,000 --> 01:25:36,000
It is.

1353
01:25:37,000 --> 01:25:38,000
Somebody said that.

1354
01:25:38,000 --> 01:25:39,000
Smooth like an erection.

1355
01:25:42,000 --> 01:25:44,000
All right, this is PG-13 stream.

1356
01:25:45,000 --> 01:25:46,000
I was sorry, I don't even know what that meant.

1357
01:25:47,000 --> 01:25:48,000
I was about to ask.

1358
01:25:49,000 --> 01:25:51,000
Oh, yeah, shot.

1359
01:25:51,000 --> 01:25:53,000
No, that guy just got me.

1360
01:25:53,000 --> 01:25:55,000
This thing doesn't go very far.

1361
01:25:55,000 --> 01:25:56,000
Forget that sometimes.

1362
01:25:56,000 --> 01:25:59,000
I'm just going to the attack on the map right now.

1363
01:25:59,000 --> 01:26:01,000
I'm doing a live right behind you.

1364
01:26:01,000 --> 01:26:01,000
John lands.

1365
01:26:01,000 --> 01:26:02,000
Where is he?

1366
01:26:02,000 --> 01:26:02,000
Uh-oh.

1367
01:26:02,000 --> 01:26:03,000
Try to go past the guy.

1368
01:26:03,000 --> 01:26:04,000
Oh, God.

1369
01:26:04,000 --> 01:26:05,000
Not a jet pack.

1370
01:26:09,000 --> 01:26:11,000
I'm trying to prove on the pet is scared.

1371
01:26:11,000 --> 01:26:14,000
Well, the classes have a lot of impact on that as well.

1372
01:26:14,000 --> 01:26:14,000
What's the time for you?

1373
01:26:14,000 --> 01:26:16,000
All right, fine.

1374
01:26:16,000 --> 01:26:18,000
Yeah, if you're like the fastest class, what do you?

1375
01:26:18,000 --> 01:26:19,000
Oh, damn.

1376
01:26:19,000 --> 01:26:20,000
I am a raider.

1377
01:26:20,000 --> 01:26:21,000
Yeah, I just tried to do something.

1378
01:26:21,000 --> 01:26:22,000
I guess somebody behind you saw.

1379
01:26:23,000 --> 01:26:24,000
Slow down a little bit and do them.

1380
01:26:24,000 --> 01:26:27,000
That this list game is the person that just asked.

1381
01:26:27,000 --> 01:26:27,000
This game is free.

1382
01:26:28,000 --> 01:26:30,000
And it's in open beta.

1383
01:26:30,000 --> 01:26:31,000
You can just play it.

1384
01:26:31,000 --> 01:26:32,000
You play it as much as you want.

1385
01:26:33,000 --> 01:26:34,000
Whatever you want.

1386
01:26:36,000 --> 01:26:39,000
And it's a game about skin, momentum, and fun.

1387
01:26:40,000 --> 01:26:41,000
The ski simulation game.

1388
01:26:42,000 --> 01:26:42,000
Yes.

1389
01:26:43,000 --> 01:26:44,000
Oh, this guy smart.

1390
01:26:44,000 --> 01:26:45,000
What do I do with this smart guy?

1391
01:26:45,000 --> 01:26:46,000
Wait till he lands.

1392
01:26:49,000 --> 01:26:52,000
Oh, I believe I've been carrying the flag this entire time.

1393
01:26:52,000 --> 01:26:53,000
I really can't.

1394
01:26:55,000 --> 01:26:56,000
We're taking care of that team here.

1395
01:27:00,000 --> 01:27:01,000
Uh-oh.

1396
01:27:02,000 --> 01:27:05,000
Are we going to get to see some real raw burga boy rage?

1397
01:27:07,000 --> 01:27:09,000
Remember, burga boy, you can't say any like wicked horrible swiss.

1398
01:27:09,000 --> 01:27:11,000
Oh, I'm going to run into a wall.

1399
01:27:11,000 --> 01:27:13,000
Oh, I ran into a wall.

1400
01:27:13,000 --> 01:27:14,000
It's over.

1401
01:27:14,000 --> 01:27:15,000
I see it.

1402
01:27:15,000 --> 01:27:17,000
I'll tell you.

1403
01:27:17,000 --> 01:27:19,000
This was on me.

1404
01:27:19,000 --> 01:27:21,000
Oh, you're going to go with this boom.

1405
01:27:21,000 --> 01:27:23,000
Oh, nice.

1406
01:27:23,000 --> 01:27:25,000
Nice.

1407
01:27:25,000 --> 01:27:27,000
It was a good run.

1408
01:27:27,000 --> 01:27:29,000
Very nice.

1409
01:27:29,000 --> 01:27:31,000
Very nice.

1410
01:27:31,000 --> 01:27:33,000
Burga boy is in first place.

1411
01:27:33,000 --> 01:27:35,000
Burga boy.

1412
01:27:35,000 --> 01:27:37,000
There you go.

1413
01:27:37,000 --> 01:27:39,000
Oh, yeah.

1414
01:27:39,000 --> 01:27:41,000
That's going to get that flag.

1415
01:27:41,000 --> 01:27:43,000
One of our guys got the flag.

1416
01:27:45,000 --> 01:27:47,000
Oh, come on.

1417
01:27:47,000 --> 01:27:49,000
You got to get better aim.

1418
01:27:49,000 --> 01:27:51,000
Come on, land.

1419
01:27:51,000 --> 01:27:53,000
Oh, I got a whamble on this thing.

1420
01:27:53,000 --> 01:27:55,000
What am I doing?

1421
01:27:55,000 --> 01:27:57,000
Oh, I got to get to an ammo supply.

1422
01:27:59,000 --> 01:28:01,000
Oh, damn.

1423
01:28:01,000 --> 01:28:03,000
Not doing so well right this second.

1424
01:28:03,000 --> 01:28:05,000
Oh, that's not.

1425
01:28:05,000 --> 01:28:07,000
Not doing so hot right there.

1426
01:28:07,000 --> 01:28:09,000
I just grenade it myself.

1427
01:28:09,000 --> 01:28:13,000
Like as fast as you move in this game,

1428
01:28:13,000 --> 01:28:15,000
that is nearly impossible.

1429
01:28:15,000 --> 01:28:17,000
Yeah, I know.

1430
01:28:17,000 --> 01:28:19,000
That's crazy.

1431
01:28:19,000 --> 01:28:21,000
I got that guy on the couple of shots.

1432
01:28:21,000 --> 01:28:25,000
Oh, that guy doing some speed.

1433
01:28:25,000 --> 01:28:27,000
I'll get this guy.

1434
01:28:27,000 --> 01:28:29,000
I'll thump this guy.

1435
01:28:29,000 --> 01:28:31,000
I'll tumble as better than thump us.

1436
01:28:31,000 --> 01:28:33,000
No, not high enough.

1437
01:28:33,000 --> 01:28:35,000
Wait, the flag is dropped.

1438
01:28:35,000 --> 01:28:37,000
I have the flag on my back.

1439
01:28:37,000 --> 01:28:39,000
Get out of the tower.

1440
01:28:39,000 --> 01:28:41,000
I got it.

1441
01:28:41,000 --> 01:28:43,000
I blew that guy away from you guys.

1442
01:28:43,000 --> 01:28:45,000
Alright, protect the towers.

1443
01:28:45,000 --> 01:28:47,000
Or I could just sit down here alone by myself.

1444
01:28:47,000 --> 01:28:49,000
I'll play it again.

1445
01:28:49,000 --> 01:28:51,000
Let's go.

1446
01:28:51,000 --> 01:28:55,000
Oh, I just got air shot.

1447
01:28:55,000 --> 01:28:57,000
Damn.

1448
01:28:57,000 --> 01:29:01,000
I'll lose a momentum here.

1449
01:29:01,000 --> 01:29:05,000
I just got mad air shot.

1450
01:29:05,000 --> 01:29:07,000
I'm dead.

1451
01:29:07,000 --> 01:29:11,000
I don't know how I dropped the flag.

1452
01:29:11,000 --> 01:29:13,000
We are.

1453
01:29:13,000 --> 01:29:15,000
I believe there are some grenades

1454
01:29:15,000 --> 01:29:17,000
that can make you drop stuff.

1455
01:29:17,000 --> 01:29:19,000
Like that.

1456
01:29:19,000 --> 01:29:21,000
That's lame.

1457
01:29:21,000 --> 01:29:23,000
Actually, that's pretty cool.

1458
01:29:23,000 --> 01:29:25,000
Land on that.

1459
01:29:25,000 --> 01:29:27,000
Oh, damn it.

1460
01:29:27,000 --> 01:29:29,000
I got to get more.

1461
01:29:29,000 --> 01:29:31,000
I got to get out of town.

1462
01:29:31,000 --> 01:29:33,000
Back off.

1463
01:29:33,000 --> 01:29:41,000
Just got killed by a blue fatty.

1464
01:29:41,000 --> 01:29:43,000
Somebody just said.

1465
01:29:43,000 --> 01:29:45,000
Juggernaut?

1466
01:29:45,000 --> 01:29:49,000
Yeah, that's a juggernaut, probably.

1467
01:29:49,000 --> 01:29:51,000
I might want to pull out the...

1468
01:29:51,000 --> 01:29:53,000
No, I might kill him.

1469
01:29:53,000 --> 01:29:55,000
One more shot. Come on.

1470
01:29:55,000 --> 01:29:57,000
This is the one right here.

1471
01:29:57,000 --> 01:29:59,000
There we go.

1472
01:29:59,000 --> 01:30:03,000
I need to go to resupply big time.

1473
01:30:03,000 --> 01:30:05,000
Oh, ship has got a new video.

1474
01:30:05,000 --> 01:30:07,000
Reserve shooter.

1475
01:30:07,000 --> 01:30:09,000
Sick.

1476
01:30:09,000 --> 01:30:11,000
Oh, he's a nice guy.

1477
01:30:11,000 --> 01:30:13,000
Oh, he's a nice guy.

1478
01:30:13,000 --> 01:30:15,000
Oh, yeah.

1479
01:30:15,000 --> 01:30:17,000
Flag down, baby.

1480
01:30:17,000 --> 01:30:19,000
Should I?

1481
01:30:19,000 --> 01:30:21,000
All right.

1482
01:30:21,000 --> 01:30:23,000
We're beating him by like...

1483
01:30:23,000 --> 01:30:25,000
We have like a 100% lead on them right now.

1484
01:30:25,000 --> 01:30:27,000
I'm trying to get like hit markers on him.

1485
01:30:27,000 --> 01:30:37,000
But man, I tell you right now this game is a lot of fun.

1486
01:30:37,000 --> 01:30:41,000
I probably wouldn't have even started playing this game,

1487
01:30:41,000 --> 01:30:43,000
but it was not for a tellyx.

1488
01:30:43,000 --> 01:30:45,000
Thank you, sir.

1489
01:30:45,000 --> 01:30:47,000
Thank you.

1490
01:30:47,000 --> 01:30:49,000
It was like you got to play this game.

1491
01:30:49,000 --> 01:30:51,000
You were like, ah, what happened?

1492
01:30:51,000 --> 01:30:53,000
I was like, I'll give it a try.

1493
01:30:53,000 --> 01:30:55,000
This game is very, very good.

1494
01:30:55,000 --> 01:30:59,000
I saw it before a long time ago, like months ago,

1495
01:30:59,000 --> 01:31:01,000
and people were first started talking about it.

1496
01:31:01,000 --> 01:31:05,000
And I was like, yeah, it looks okay, but this game is very addicting.

1497
01:31:05,000 --> 01:31:07,000
Very fun.

1498
01:31:07,000 --> 01:31:09,000
Somebody's behind me, but I don't care to turn around.

1499
01:31:09,000 --> 01:31:11,000
And it's free.

1500
01:31:11,000 --> 01:31:13,000
Yeah.

1501
01:31:13,000 --> 01:31:17,000
As a huge class right there, I actually don't buy games that were like 10 bucks.

1502
01:31:17,000 --> 01:31:21,000
Yeah, Burger Boy doesn't buy video games until they are 10 dollars.

1503
01:31:21,000 --> 01:31:25,000
And we're talking like Skyrim, which up, but it's like Skyrim,

1504
01:31:25,000 --> 01:31:27,000
do you never gonna get that game?

1505
01:31:27,000 --> 01:31:29,000
Oh, that's about going to get Skyrim for three years from now.

1506
01:31:29,000 --> 01:31:33,000
Yeah, you're going to get Skyrim like when you're like 35.

1507
01:31:33,000 --> 01:31:35,000
10 bucks?

1508
01:31:35,000 --> 01:31:37,000
Is it 10 bucks yet?

1509
01:31:37,000 --> 01:31:39,000
That's always the Burger Boy quote.

1510
01:31:39,000 --> 01:31:43,000
I'll be like, oh, hey dude, you know like Diablo 3 just came out.

1511
01:31:43,000 --> 01:31:45,000
10 bucks yet?

1512
01:31:45,000 --> 01:31:47,000
No, it's not.

1513
01:31:47,000 --> 01:31:49,000
It's like 60.

1514
01:31:49,000 --> 01:31:51,000
10 bucks.

1515
01:31:51,000 --> 01:31:55,000
I'm going to try and help you with this dude.

1516
01:31:55,000 --> 01:31:57,000
Nice.

1517
01:31:57,000 --> 01:31:59,000
Yep.

1518
01:31:59,000 --> 01:32:01,000
He was getting on you pretty good.

1519
01:32:01,000 --> 01:32:03,000
Yeah.

1520
01:32:03,000 --> 01:32:05,000
Hey, he's in 13 and I thought.

1521
01:32:05,000 --> 01:32:07,000
Yeah, all right, let me know when I'm ready.

1522
01:32:07,000 --> 01:32:09,000
Nobody will see.

1523
01:32:09,000 --> 01:32:11,000
What does your just say?

1524
01:32:11,000 --> 01:32:13,000
I really just didn't even pay attention to the word you said.

1525
01:32:13,000 --> 01:32:15,000
Oh, I need to get up here.

1526
01:32:15,000 --> 01:32:17,000
I'm dead.

1527
01:32:17,000 --> 01:32:19,000
Oh, top fragging like a bow.

1528
01:32:19,000 --> 01:32:21,000
I've got the guy for you.

1529
01:32:21,000 --> 01:32:23,000
Got the guy for you.

1530
01:32:23,000 --> 01:32:25,000
Nice.

1531
01:32:25,000 --> 01:32:27,000
Let's see if I can give a slider with the hair strike.

1532
01:32:27,000 --> 01:32:29,000
Let's give you a walk right into it.

1533
01:32:29,000 --> 01:32:31,000
Oh, no, he almost got him.

1534
01:32:31,000 --> 01:32:33,000
He was in the air.

1535
01:32:33,000 --> 01:32:37,000
At least it looked close from over here.

1536
01:32:37,000 --> 01:32:41,000
Ah, trying to get him in the air.

1537
01:32:41,000 --> 01:32:43,000
Not shooting far enough ahead of him.

1538
01:32:43,000 --> 01:32:45,000
No, still not shooting far enough ahead of him.

1539
01:32:45,000 --> 01:32:47,000
Oh, that could have been an air shot.

1540
01:32:47,000 --> 01:32:49,000
Come on now.

1541
01:32:49,000 --> 01:32:51,000
Mother may I.

1542
01:32:51,000 --> 01:32:57,000
I don't know.

1543
01:32:57,000 --> 01:32:59,000
All right, I need to wait.

1544
01:32:59,000 --> 01:33:01,000
I got to recharge like stuff here.

1545
01:33:01,000 --> 01:33:03,000
Oh, God.

1546
01:33:03,000 --> 01:33:05,000
Is that Marshall?

1547
01:33:05,000 --> 01:33:07,000
Yeah, boy.

1548
01:33:07,000 --> 01:33:09,000
Here we go.

1549
01:33:09,000 --> 01:33:11,000
Victory.

1550
01:33:11,000 --> 01:33:13,000
All right, let's get Ari in here.

1551
01:33:13,000 --> 01:33:15,000
First one of the day.

1552
01:33:15,000 --> 01:33:17,000
There he is.

1553
01:33:17,000 --> 01:33:19,000
Oh, wonderful.

1554
01:33:19,000 --> 01:33:21,000
That's what killed Tony.

1555
01:33:21,000 --> 01:33:23,000
It burned a boy nice.

1556
01:33:23,000 --> 01:33:25,000
I would not buy Team Fortress Classic.

1557
01:33:25,000 --> 01:33:29,000
The only reason why I say that is because it's just,

1558
01:33:29,000 --> 01:33:33,000
it's very, and now it's just so difficult to play.

1559
01:33:33,000 --> 01:33:35,000
This grenade spam is,

1560
01:33:35,000 --> 01:33:37,000
it's,

1561
01:33:37,000 --> 01:33:39,000
it's,

1562
01:33:39,000 --> 01:33:41,000
it's like five dollars don't buy it.

1563
01:33:41,000 --> 01:33:43,000
I'll put it that way.

1564
01:33:43,000 --> 01:33:47,000
Winner, winner, chicken dinner.

1565
01:33:47,000 --> 01:33:51,000
I think this is the first time I've ever gotten first place

1566
01:33:51,000 --> 01:33:53,000
in anything in drives.

1567
01:33:53,000 --> 01:33:55,000
Oh, really?

1568
01:33:55,000 --> 01:33:59,000
That isn't achievement in and of itself for me.

1569
01:33:59,000 --> 01:34:05,000
Not even first in the whole game.

1570
01:34:05,000 --> 01:34:07,000
This first in my team is, that's good enough.

1571
01:34:07,000 --> 01:34:09,000
All right, quick flood to bloody go.

1572
01:34:09,000 --> 01:34:11,000
Bloody go.

1573
01:34:11,000 --> 01:34:13,000
Bloody go.

1574
01:34:13,000 --> 01:34:15,000
Yes.

1575
01:34:15,000 --> 01:34:19,000
Go back to pass find her.

1576
01:34:19,000 --> 01:34:21,000
Oh, there's a guy right here.

1577
01:34:21,000 --> 01:34:23,000
Oh, yeah, shot.

1578
01:34:23,000 --> 01:34:27,000
Get the first kill that gives you that flagged.

1579
01:34:27,000 --> 01:34:29,000
It does?

1580
01:34:29,000 --> 01:34:31,000
Oh, it seems to fit on call it.

1581
01:34:31,000 --> 01:34:33,000
He never played team to fit on call it.

1582
01:34:33,000 --> 01:34:35,000
Hey, watch it.

1583
01:34:35,000 --> 01:34:37,000
I can't believe it.

1584
01:34:37,000 --> 01:34:39,000
Oh, he's going to kill me.

1585
01:34:39,000 --> 01:34:41,000
No, Jeremy, you have to be the first kill in my first death.

1586
01:34:41,000 --> 01:34:43,000
I'm going to be the, I'm going to be the first death if I don't get Lord chaos.

1587
01:34:43,000 --> 01:34:45,000
I'm the first damn death.

1588
01:34:45,000 --> 01:34:47,000
Wow, that was the lucky skill I've ever had.

1589
01:34:47,000 --> 01:34:49,000
Yeah, I'll probably do videos with drives.

1590
01:34:49,000 --> 01:34:53,000
Eventually everyone, I got, I got to get familiar with it, get to go to edit.

1591
01:34:53,000 --> 01:34:55,000
But I'll probably do a few videos at least.

1592
01:34:55,000 --> 01:34:57,000
Yep.

1593
01:34:57,000 --> 01:35:01,000
Because this game is really awesome.

1594
01:35:01,000 --> 01:35:03,000
Boom.

1595
01:35:03,000 --> 01:35:05,000
The other, boom.

1596
01:35:05,000 --> 01:35:07,000
Where am I? I'm going the absolute wrong direction.

1597
01:35:07,000 --> 01:35:09,000
All right.

1598
01:35:09,000 --> 01:35:11,000
I'm going to get some speed here.

1599
01:35:11,000 --> 01:35:13,000
Pick it up speed.

1600
01:35:13,000 --> 01:35:15,000
Pick it up speed.

1601
01:35:15,000 --> 01:35:17,000
Got him.

1602
01:35:17,000 --> 01:35:18,000
And it's all got me.

1603
01:35:18,000 --> 01:35:19,000
Oh, we got to get that flagged.

1604
01:35:19,000 --> 01:35:20,000
We got it.

1605
01:35:20,000 --> 01:35:22,000
Somebody on our team got it.

1606
01:35:22,000 --> 01:35:26,000
MLC stealth is going to die.

1607
01:35:26,000 --> 01:35:30,000
Look at that chaos grenade into the chaos.

1608
01:35:30,000 --> 01:35:32,000
Oh, I thought I got that guy.

1609
01:35:32,000 --> 01:35:34,000
I did it back.

1610
01:35:34,000 --> 01:35:38,000
My game is just updating.

1611
01:35:38,000 --> 01:35:40,000
It's doing some really weird stuff.

1612
01:35:40,000 --> 01:35:46,000
Hey, when we installed it on burger boys computer is like all his fans turned on.

1613
01:35:46,000 --> 01:35:48,000
This computer almost like.

1614
01:35:48,000 --> 01:35:50,000
Just load random.

1615
01:35:50,000 --> 01:35:52,000
These surprise.

1616
01:35:52,000 --> 01:35:54,000
That is like awesome computer.

1617
01:35:54,000 --> 01:35:56,000
Nice shot.

1618
01:35:56,000 --> 01:35:58,000
That guy got a really good shot.

1619
01:35:58,000 --> 01:36:00,000
We've had issues with borderline.

1620
01:36:00,000 --> 01:36:02,000
We've had issues.

1621
01:36:02,000 --> 01:36:04,000
Burger boy borderlands.

1622
01:36:04,000 --> 01:36:10,000
How many times have you heard burger boy swear and say horrible things in borderlands?

1623
01:36:10,000 --> 01:36:12,000
Oh, oh, god.

1624
01:36:12,000 --> 01:36:16,000
He did rematch his keys for his special ability.

1625
01:36:16,000 --> 01:36:22,000
Every time we went to pick up an item he decided to activate his special ability.

1626
01:36:22,000 --> 01:36:24,000
And playing is breaking.

1627
01:36:24,000 --> 01:36:30,000
It's just screaming constantly for the entire three hours that we played at that time.

1628
01:36:30,000 --> 01:36:32,000
Worst tank ever.

1629
01:36:32,000 --> 01:36:34,000
Oh, burger boy.

1630
01:36:34,000 --> 01:36:36,000
Come on.

1631
01:36:36,000 --> 01:36:40,000
You can do better than that.

1632
01:36:40,000 --> 01:36:42,000
Let's go shoddy.

1633
01:36:42,000 --> 01:36:44,000
I don't have any momentum.

1634
01:36:44,000 --> 01:36:46,000
I'm like walking around the man.

1635
01:36:46,000 --> 01:36:48,000
Oh, I got that guy.

1636
01:36:48,000 --> 01:36:50,000
Oh, I saw that.

1637
01:36:50,000 --> 01:36:54,000
I'm going to waste this grenade.

1638
01:36:54,000 --> 01:36:56,000
Let's get this guy.

1639
01:36:56,000 --> 01:36:58,000
Double team.

1640
01:36:58,000 --> 01:37:02,000
Oh, I missed.

1641
01:37:02,000 --> 01:37:04,000
There we go.

1642
01:37:04,000 --> 01:37:08,000
Another guy right there.

1643
01:37:08,000 --> 01:37:10,000
Two guys.

1644
01:37:10,000 --> 01:37:12,000
Seven seventy.

1645
01:37:12,000 --> 01:37:14,000
That's a direct shot.

1646
01:37:14,000 --> 01:37:16,000
Oh, I got a phone.

1647
01:37:16,000 --> 01:37:18,000
Oh, he knew it.

1648
01:37:18,000 --> 01:37:20,000
Wow, that was awesome.

1649
01:37:20,000 --> 01:37:22,000
I mean, a flag boy.

1650
01:37:22,000 --> 01:37:24,000
Holy crap.

1651
01:37:24,000 --> 01:37:26,000
That was awesome.

1652
01:37:26,000 --> 01:37:28,000
Yes.

1653
01:37:28,000 --> 01:37:32,000
I just tried to get a re-supply and a guy threw a grenade right into my feet when I went over there and got me.

1654
01:37:32,000 --> 01:37:34,000
Two shame, I've written.

1655
01:37:34,000 --> 01:37:38,000
That was great.

1656
01:37:38,000 --> 01:37:42,000
Down.

1657
01:37:42,000 --> 01:37:44,000
Woo.

1658
01:37:44,000 --> 01:37:48,000
Oh, so, Trevor, what classes do you have in life so far?

1659
01:37:48,000 --> 01:37:52,000
Just the sniper Sentinel.

1660
01:37:52,000 --> 01:37:58,000
Nice thing about yesterday, we were talking about the ones that don't detonate on the impacts.

1661
01:37:58,000 --> 01:38:00,000
Yeah, they bounce around.

1662
01:38:00,000 --> 01:38:04,000
I have the grenade launcher right now and I notice that if you get a direct hit, it's like the demo man.

1663
01:38:04,000 --> 01:38:06,000
You know, I'll just explode.

1664
01:38:06,000 --> 01:38:08,000
Oh, really?

1665
01:38:08,000 --> 01:38:10,000
Immediately.

1666
01:38:10,000 --> 01:38:12,000
I'm just thinking about them also.

1667
01:38:12,000 --> 01:38:16,000
Is it that they usually do a lot more damage and have a bigger radius than like the spin fusers?

1668
01:38:16,000 --> 01:38:18,000
Yeah, I've noticed that the explosion is huge.

1669
01:38:18,000 --> 01:38:22,000
You can just get a massive damage spike right there.

1670
01:38:22,000 --> 01:38:24,000
I'm going to the lava.

1671
01:38:24,000 --> 01:38:26,000
I keep falling in lava.

1672
01:38:26,000 --> 01:38:28,000
I'm gonna hit it.

1673
01:38:28,000 --> 01:38:30,000
Hey, it's done.

1674
01:38:30,000 --> 01:38:32,000
I can't help it.

1675
01:38:32,000 --> 01:38:36,000
Does anybody else feel like they're playing like Star Wars?

1676
01:38:36,000 --> 01:38:38,000
I like feeling like they are on like that map.

1677
01:38:38,000 --> 01:38:40,000
Yeah.

1678
01:38:40,000 --> 01:38:42,000
What's that called?

1679
01:38:42,000 --> 01:38:44,000
I mean, even the noises like the...

1680
01:38:44,000 --> 01:38:48,000
I feel like the green or green, it sounds like Star Wars.

1681
01:38:48,000 --> 01:38:50,000
Oh, thank you.

1682
01:38:50,000 --> 01:38:52,000
So what are you guys favorite classes with the games?

1683
01:38:52,000 --> 01:38:54,000
I like moving fast and having zero in all.

1684
01:38:54,000 --> 01:38:56,000
Fast, find them.

1685
01:38:56,000 --> 01:39:00,000
Yeah, I'd probably say the fast find too.

1686
01:39:00,000 --> 01:39:02,000
Just give the shock on the cell.

1687
01:39:02,000 --> 01:39:04,000
Break the trend.

1688
01:39:04,000 --> 01:39:06,000
Break the trend.

1689
01:39:06,000 --> 01:39:08,000
Can I go down the radar or infiltrator?

1690
01:39:08,000 --> 01:39:10,000
See I don't even... I gotta get those guys.

1691
01:39:10,000 --> 01:39:12,000
I'm not very good with the infiltrator yet.

1692
01:39:12,000 --> 01:39:16,000
Never been good with stealthing classes in any game.

1693
01:39:16,000 --> 01:39:18,000
That's so fun!

1694
01:39:18,000 --> 01:39:20,000
Yeah, so you can cloac?

1695
01:39:20,000 --> 01:39:22,000
Oh yeah, you can cloak.

1696
01:39:22,000 --> 01:39:26,000
Instead of using your energy per your jet pack it'll use it for your stealth.

1697
01:39:26,000 --> 01:39:30,000
Oh, okay. That's a good tradeoff.

1698
01:39:30,000 --> 01:39:32,000
That's not like an overpowering and what that's cool.

1699
01:39:32,000 --> 01:39:41,000
And there's a few items in my perks, making up perks, but I know it's at least one or two items that can detect still people.

1700
01:39:41,000 --> 01:39:43,000
Oh really? I don't have any of those yet.

1701
01:39:43,000 --> 01:39:50,000
There's a lot of people here. I'm so dead. Yeah, there's like 10 people around me.

1702
01:39:51,000 --> 01:39:56,000
Skate down here. Oh Tony Hawk presents tribes ascent.

1703
01:39:56,000 --> 01:40:00,000
Do a kick flip.

1704
01:40:00,000 --> 01:40:05,000
All right, I'm gonna do like a shaky 200. Oh, that's like 25 points.

1705
01:40:05,000 --> 01:40:08,000
All right, I'm gonna get some speed.

1706
01:40:08,000 --> 01:40:12,000
Yeah, I cannot catch up to the cat flag carrier.

1707
01:40:12,000 --> 01:40:16,000
No, I tried to cut him off.

1708
01:40:16,000 --> 01:40:18,000
I burger boy come.

1709
01:40:18,000 --> 01:40:21,000
How did you know it was him?

1710
01:40:21,000 --> 01:40:24,000
I don't know.

1711
01:40:24,000 --> 01:40:27,000
Hey, car. I'm like a stream.

1712
01:40:27,000 --> 01:40:30,000
I know germa's ringtone and I'm pretty sure bring boys on.

1713
01:40:30,000 --> 01:40:34,000
I'm always going to have a stun on him right now.

1714
01:40:34,000 --> 01:40:37,000
What if the talisman? I didn't think he would.

1715
01:40:37,000 --> 01:40:41,000
I thought that was more of a burger boy thing to have a stun on him.

1716
01:40:41,000 --> 01:40:43,000
What that means about you? I don't know.

1717
01:40:43,000 --> 01:40:45,000
Can you do that? Can you do that?

1718
01:40:45,000 --> 01:40:47,000
Oh, yeah, I got flag.

1719
01:40:47,000 --> 01:40:49,000
Hey, we're losing.

1720
01:40:49,000 --> 01:40:52,000
Yeah, I got flag. Just protecting me.

1721
01:40:52,000 --> 01:40:55,000
Yeah, what I want? What I want?

1722
01:40:55,000 --> 01:40:57,000
Oh, I'm going to lose speed right now.

1723
01:40:57,000 --> 01:41:00,000
I'm going to be sitting duck in two seconds.

1724
01:41:00,000 --> 01:41:02,000
I'm going to be your body shield.

1725
01:41:02,000 --> 01:41:06,000
Oh, my God, there's a whole crew just following you.

1726
01:41:06,000 --> 01:41:08,000
Did I kill that guy?

1727
01:41:08,000 --> 01:41:11,000
Oh, finally, geez.

1728
01:41:11,000 --> 01:41:13,000
Oh, yeah, I got one up for you.

1729
01:41:13,000 --> 01:41:17,000
Oh, I'm dead. I got to kill though.

1730
01:41:17,000 --> 01:41:19,000
Good, man.

1731
01:41:19,000 --> 01:41:22,000
I got another kill.

1732
01:41:22,000 --> 01:41:27,000
I'm going to land right on top of everybody that's right there.

1733
01:41:27,000 --> 01:41:29,000
Oh, no.

1734
01:41:29,000 --> 01:41:32,000
Give me that flag. I ran right by it.

1735
01:41:32,000 --> 01:41:34,000
Oh, no.

1736
01:41:34,000 --> 01:41:36,000
Oh, that bastard got it.

1737
01:41:36,000 --> 01:41:38,000
No.

1738
01:41:38,000 --> 01:41:40,000
Oh, give the shotgun up.

1739
01:41:40,000 --> 01:41:43,000
Oh, damn.

1740
01:41:43,000 --> 01:41:45,000
A shotgun. That's weapon in this game.

1741
01:41:45,000 --> 01:41:47,000
Yeah, I didn't pull it out early enough.

1742
01:41:47,000 --> 01:41:49,000
I should have pulled it up way earlier.

1743
01:41:49,000 --> 01:41:51,000
Oh, it's Alex. Don't die.

1744
01:41:51,000 --> 01:41:53,000
I got him. I got him, man. Almost died.

1745
01:41:53,000 --> 01:41:56,000
I have 13 health.

1746
01:41:56,000 --> 01:41:59,000
My strength.

1747
01:41:59,000 --> 01:42:04,000
I'm not saying you're destroying.

1748
01:42:04,000 --> 01:42:06,000
16 kills, man.

1749
01:42:06,000 --> 01:42:09,000
I think I just blew that guy's grenade up in midair in front of him.

1750
01:42:09,000 --> 01:42:12,000
I think that's actually what just happened.

1751
01:42:12,000 --> 01:42:14,000
Where is the flag?

1752
01:42:14,000 --> 01:42:16,000
I don't know. We don't have it.

1753
01:42:16,000 --> 01:42:18,000
It's a pretty close game right now.

1754
01:42:18,000 --> 01:42:20,000
I can't live this.

1755
01:42:20,000 --> 01:42:23,000
Oh, I just totally stole that from your burger, boy.

1756
01:42:23,000 --> 01:42:28,000
Malay is so tough, but so satisfying when you get it.

1757
01:42:28,000 --> 01:42:32,000
I only do like an 8k people or like snipers.

1758
01:42:32,000 --> 01:42:34,000
Someone's just like...

1759
01:42:34,000 --> 01:42:35,000
Someone's just like...

1760
01:42:35,000 --> 01:42:38,000
Are they hats in this game?

1761
01:42:38,000 --> 01:42:40,000
I wouldn't...

1762
01:42:40,000 --> 01:42:41,000
Don't put a past in, man.

1763
01:42:41,000 --> 01:42:46,000
This game could have a lot of items in the coming future.

1764
01:42:46,000 --> 01:42:48,000
It's a guy with that freaking cross.

1765
01:42:48,000 --> 01:42:49,000
I got the flag guy.

1766
01:42:49,000 --> 01:42:51,000
All right. You got the flag?

1767
01:42:51,000 --> 01:42:52,000
We're going to lose.

1768
01:42:52,000 --> 01:42:55,000
We're absolutely going to lose.

1769
01:42:55,000 --> 01:42:57,000
Try and cut this flag guy off.

1770
01:42:57,000 --> 01:42:59,000
Yeah, we're going to lose.

1771
01:42:59,000 --> 01:43:00,000
It's a done deal.

1772
01:43:00,000 --> 01:43:02,000
Cut him off.

1773
01:43:02,000 --> 01:43:04,000
Not over yet, guys.

1774
01:43:04,000 --> 01:43:06,000
That guy's out of speed.

1775
01:43:06,000 --> 01:43:07,000
That guy's out of speed.

1776
01:43:07,000 --> 01:43:08,000
7 to 24.

1777
01:43:08,000 --> 01:43:09,000
I think it's over.

1778
01:43:09,000 --> 01:43:10,000
5.

1779
01:43:10,000 --> 01:43:13,000
Oh, yeah.

1780
01:43:13,000 --> 01:43:14,000
Oh, yeah.

1781
01:43:14,000 --> 01:43:15,000
Absolutely.

1782
01:43:15,000 --> 01:43:16,000
Somebody called in the nuke.

1783
01:43:16,000 --> 01:43:18,000
Oh.

1784
01:43:18,000 --> 01:43:19,000
Wait, no.

1785
01:43:19,000 --> 01:43:22,000
I had 10,000 credits, but I called in an inventory station instead.

1786
01:43:22,000 --> 01:43:25,000
MLC has killed me 15 times in a row.

1787
01:43:25,000 --> 01:43:27,000
That's how he said.

1788
01:43:27,000 --> 01:43:29,000
I feel like a re-target.

1789
01:43:29,000 --> 01:43:32,000
I was supposed to call an orbital strike, but I called him the inventory station.

1790
01:43:32,000 --> 01:43:34,000
Sorry, there's nobody died.

1791
01:43:34,000 --> 01:43:35,000
Give me that flag.

1792
01:43:35,000 --> 01:43:38,000
No.

1793
01:43:38,000 --> 01:43:41,000
Oh, all right.

1794
01:43:41,000 --> 01:43:45,000
I think, uh, probably one more round maybe.

1795
01:43:45,000 --> 01:43:47,000
Do you guys want to play CTF?

1796
01:43:47,000 --> 01:43:48,000
Or just keep doing this?

1797
01:43:48,000 --> 01:43:50,000
Um, I don't know.

1798
01:43:50,000 --> 01:43:52,000
CTF can be very, very long.

1799
01:43:52,000 --> 01:43:55,000
So I'll just do one more of this.

1800
01:43:55,000 --> 01:43:57,000
You were here yet already?

1801
01:43:57,000 --> 01:43:59,000
You did your game load?

1802
01:43:59,000 --> 01:44:01,000
45 seconds.

1803
01:44:01,000 --> 01:44:06,000
He says 20 minutes ago.

1804
01:44:06,000 --> 01:44:08,000
I don't know where he's.

1805
01:44:08,000 --> 01:44:11,000
I mean, I got this game when Beta first was announced for this.

1806
01:44:11,000 --> 01:44:13,000
I signed up for this like this in Firefall.

1807
01:44:13,000 --> 01:44:15,000
I signed up for like years ago.

1808
01:44:15,000 --> 01:44:16,000
Yeah.

1809
01:44:16,000 --> 01:44:19,000
And Firefall is incredible.

1810
01:44:19,000 --> 01:44:21,000
I got the beta for that as well.

1811
01:44:21,000 --> 01:44:22,000
So jealous.

1812
01:44:22,000 --> 01:44:25,000
Uh, it's only two times a week though.

1813
01:44:25,000 --> 01:44:27,000
You can only have gone in those two periods.

1814
01:44:27,000 --> 01:44:29,000
You can't figure out one for you.

1815
01:44:29,000 --> 01:44:31,000
Asked, but it is, it is insane.

1816
01:44:31,000 --> 01:44:33,000
It's looking like an incredible game.

1817
01:44:33,000 --> 01:44:35,000
If you get a chance to get it, what is five?

1818
01:44:35,000 --> 01:44:36,000
What is five four?

1819
01:44:36,000 --> 01:44:37,000
What is it?

1820
01:44:37,000 --> 01:44:40,000
It's another free to play game coming out.

1821
01:44:40,000 --> 01:44:44,000
And it was like the highlight of one of the highlights of E3 last year.

1822
01:44:44,000 --> 01:44:47,000
It's, um, how can you describe it?

1823
01:44:47,000 --> 01:44:49,000
How can you describe it?

1824
01:44:49,000 --> 01:44:50,000
What is it called?

1825
01:44:50,000 --> 01:44:51,000
Firefall.

1826
01:44:51,000 --> 01:44:54,000
Oh, I think you said, I thought someone said five four Of course.

1827
01:44:54,000 --> 01:44:56,000
That's what I did just say.

1828
01:44:56,000 --> 01:44:59,000
Oh, when are you going to get five four three two one?

1829
01:44:59,000 --> 01:45:03,000
It burns you and then fall as it falling.

1830
01:45:03,000 --> 01:45:06,000
Sorry, the English accent, fortunately, come across great.

1831
01:45:06,000 --> 01:45:08,000
Well, no, I'm just hitting it.

1832
01:45:08,000 --> 01:45:10,000
Firefall is like, okay, dimension.

1833
01:45:10,000 --> 01:45:14,000
Oh, fire, we played that, we played that attack East last year.

1834
01:45:14,000 --> 01:45:16,000
Yeah, that's the one.

1835
01:45:16,000 --> 01:45:17,000
Yeah.

1836
01:45:17,000 --> 01:45:21,000
Five four three two one.

1837
01:45:21,000 --> 01:45:25,000
It looks like Borderlands with an MMO and then open world.

1838
01:45:25,000 --> 01:45:28,000
And then awesome art style.

1839
01:45:28,000 --> 01:45:31,000
And it is, the odd start is absolutely beautiful.

1840
01:45:31,000 --> 01:45:34,000
It's one of the one of those my stunning games I've seen in beta.

1841
01:45:34,000 --> 01:45:36,000
Like it looks good as it is.

1842
01:45:36,000 --> 01:45:37,000
Yeah, right.

1843
01:45:37,000 --> 01:45:38,000
That's cool.

1844
01:45:38,000 --> 01:45:40,000
Oh, this guy's going to land on that.

1845
01:45:40,000 --> 01:45:42,000
No, he's not.

1846
01:45:42,000 --> 01:45:44,000
Get, get blasted.

1847
01:45:44,000 --> 01:45:45,000
Come on.

1848
01:45:45,000 --> 01:45:49,000
Oh, yeah.

1849
01:45:49,000 --> 01:45:51,000
Oh, why am I shooting?

1850
01:45:51,000 --> 01:45:53,000
I'm going to be here with being the flag guy.

1851
01:45:53,000 --> 01:45:56,000
I'm going after this dude down here.

1852
01:45:56,000 --> 01:45:57,000
What?

1853
01:45:57,000 --> 01:45:59,000
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh.

1854
01:45:59,000 --> 01:46:02,000
Playing Juggernaut, I'm a marker with Juggernaut.

1855
01:46:02,000 --> 01:46:04,000
I'm, I'm okay.

1856
01:46:04,000 --> 01:46:11,000
I'm going to get better with him.

1857
01:46:11,000 --> 01:46:14,000
Oh, come on, walk into that.

1858
01:46:14,000 --> 01:46:16,000
This guy is standing still.

1859
01:46:16,000 --> 01:46:19,000
Oh, I'm nervous.

1860
01:46:20,000 --> 01:46:23,000
I'm not looking at that.

1861
01:46:23,000 --> 01:46:25,000
I just really wanted to see that.

1862
01:46:25,000 --> 01:46:27,000
That was like 15 feet above the guy.

1863
01:46:27,000 --> 01:46:29,000
I just looked in front of him,

1864
01:46:29,000 --> 01:46:32,000
and just popped a grenade right on its back.

1865
01:46:32,000 --> 01:46:36,000
And he dropped the flag.

1866
01:46:36,000 --> 01:46:39,000
Yeah, he changed it right behind you.

1867
01:46:39,000 --> 01:46:42,000
Oh, he's dead now somebody behind me not.

1868
01:46:42,000 --> 01:46:44,000
Oh.

1869
01:46:44,000 --> 01:46:48,000
You know, I'm okay, guys.

1870
01:46:48,000 --> 01:46:51,000
Oh boy.

1871
01:46:51,000 --> 01:46:54,000
Come on, land.

1872
01:46:54,000 --> 01:46:57,000
Oh, nice shot, dude.

1873
01:46:57,000 --> 01:47:02,000
Looks like a ballet of death right there, Journal.

1874
01:47:02,000 --> 01:47:04,000
You're among being chased.

1875
01:47:04,000 --> 01:47:05,000
I'm dead.

1876
01:47:05,000 --> 01:47:06,000
I'm not going to do a button.

1877
01:47:06,000 --> 01:47:07,000
You're right next to me.

1878
01:47:07,000 --> 01:47:08,000
Why?

1879
01:47:08,000 --> 01:47:10,000
Oh, well, where is he?

1880
01:47:10,000 --> 01:47:11,000
I'm okay.

1881
01:47:11,000 --> 01:47:12,000
I'll get it at you guys, my friends list.

1882
01:47:12,000 --> 01:47:13,000
I can see your names.

1883
01:47:13,000 --> 01:47:14,000
I know.

1884
01:47:14,000 --> 01:47:15,000
Yeah.

1885
01:47:16,000 --> 01:47:19,000
I'm trying to get him to walk into this grenade.

1886
01:47:19,000 --> 01:47:22,000
He's going too fast.

1887
01:47:22,000 --> 01:47:23,000
Where'd he go?

1888
01:47:23,000 --> 01:47:24,000
I just launched him somewhere.

1889
01:47:24,000 --> 01:47:25,000
Great.

1890
01:47:25,000 --> 01:47:26,000
Where the hell is he?

1891
01:47:26,000 --> 01:47:27,000
Oh, of course.

1892
01:47:27,000 --> 01:47:28,000
He's right next to me.

1893
01:47:28,000 --> 01:47:30,000
He's got like two people behind you, Jerma.

1894
01:47:30,000 --> 01:47:31,000
Yeah, I'm trying to go.

1895
01:47:31,000 --> 01:47:33,000
I'm trying to go for this oppressing.

1896
01:47:33,000 --> 01:47:34,000
Oh, I'm stuck.

1897
01:47:34,000 --> 01:47:35,000
I'm stuck.

1898
01:47:35,000 --> 01:47:36,000
I'm going to die.

1899
01:47:36,000 --> 01:47:37,000
I'm so dead.

1900
01:47:37,000 --> 01:47:38,000
I'm like on the ground.

1901
01:47:38,000 --> 01:47:39,000
Nope.

1902
01:47:39,000 --> 01:47:40,000
Nope.

1903
01:47:40,000 --> 01:47:41,000
You've got it.

1904
01:47:41,000 --> 01:47:42,000
You've got it.

1905
01:47:42,000 --> 01:47:43,000
Oh, my god.

1906
01:47:43,000 --> 01:47:44,000
Oh, you just saved my life right there.

1907
01:47:44,000 --> 01:47:47,000
What's my graphics card?

1908
01:47:47,000 --> 01:47:50,000
I use a GTX 470.

1909
01:47:50,000 --> 01:47:51,000
In video.

1910
01:47:51,000 --> 01:47:53,000
It's good.

1911
01:47:53,000 --> 01:47:54,000
I wouldn't really recommend it.

1912
01:47:54,000 --> 01:47:57,000
If you're going to get a new graphics card, don't get the 400 series.

1913
01:47:57,000 --> 01:48:03,000
Because the 400 series, at least the 470 and the 480, they heat up way too much.

1914
01:48:03,000 --> 01:48:05,000
They are not recommended.

1915
01:48:05,000 --> 01:48:07,000
They're good cards.

1916
01:48:07,000 --> 01:48:11,000
But they can get to be like 80, 90 degrees Celsius.

1917
01:48:11,000 --> 01:48:18,000
And it's not really that good for your computer.

1918
01:48:18,000 --> 01:48:21,000
York, I did play Globla Genda.

1919
01:48:21,000 --> 01:48:25,000
I have something like 700 hours.

1920
01:48:25,000 --> 01:48:27,000
I think clocked in on that game.

1921
01:48:27,000 --> 01:48:28,000
On Global Agenda?

1922
01:48:28,000 --> 01:48:29,000
Yeah, I've got.

1923
01:48:29,000 --> 01:48:34,000
I used to play both the insus used to play it like seriously.

1924
01:48:34,000 --> 01:48:38,000
Global Agenda is a different, I think, Global Offensive.

1925
01:48:38,000 --> 01:48:41,000
No, no, Global Agenda.

1926
01:48:41,000 --> 01:48:43,000
I was before it was free.

1927
01:48:43,000 --> 01:48:45,000
We bought it and we played it.

1928
01:48:45,000 --> 01:48:46,000
Oh, god.

1929
01:48:46,000 --> 01:48:48,000
We put in hours into that game.

1930
01:48:48,000 --> 01:48:52,000
And then it all kind of went downhill after a while when they went free.

1931
01:48:52,000 --> 01:48:54,000
And they built tribes of sand instead.

1932
01:48:54,000 --> 01:48:58,000
They took all their money out of Global Agenda and put it into tribes instead.

1933
01:48:58,000 --> 01:49:01,000
That's where the end, that's cool.

1934
01:49:01,000 --> 01:49:03,000
What was Global Agenda?

1935
01:49:03,000 --> 01:49:04,000
It was a similar game.

1936
01:49:04,000 --> 01:49:06,000
Third person shooter.

1937
01:49:06,000 --> 01:49:08,000
Yeah, it was that first.

1938
01:49:08,000 --> 01:49:12,000
Then you could also get into first person when you aim down site and things like that.

1939
01:49:12,000 --> 01:49:17,000
Oh, it was a really good concept just it needed to be made by a bigger company.

1940
01:49:17,000 --> 01:49:18,000
If that makes sense.

1941
01:49:18,000 --> 01:49:20,000
Yeah, it does.

1942
01:49:20,000 --> 01:49:22,000
Like APB, I guess.

1943
01:49:22,000 --> 01:49:23,000
APB could have been.

1944
01:49:23,000 --> 01:49:24,000
I'm out of ammo, I'm still dying.

1945
01:49:24,000 --> 01:49:26,000
Or I don't know how to do that.

1946
01:49:26,000 --> 01:49:30,000
APB went into like the crapper, didn't it?

1947
01:49:30,000 --> 01:49:32,000
Because they granted a money or something?

1948
01:49:32,000 --> 01:49:33,000
Oh, yeah.

1949
01:49:33,000 --> 01:49:35,000
They were in so much debt in the end.

1950
01:49:35,000 --> 01:49:37,000
Yeah, it was just like, oh, free game.

1951
01:49:37,000 --> 01:49:38,000
We'll buy you.

1952
01:49:38,000 --> 01:49:40,000
And it's made it free for everybody.

1953
01:49:40,000 --> 01:49:42,000
It just went downhill from then on in.

1954
01:49:42,000 --> 01:49:44,000
Yeah, there is no health kit, by the way.

1955
01:49:44,000 --> 01:49:51,000
There is no health kits in this game.

1956
01:49:51,000 --> 01:49:57,000
Oh, it's itself.

1957
01:49:57,000 --> 01:49:59,000
I think we're going to win.

1958
01:49:59,000 --> 01:50:00,000
Absolutely.

1959
01:50:00,000 --> 01:50:01,000
I had the flag of the entire game.

1960
01:50:01,000 --> 01:50:02,000
I just went stand around.

1961
01:50:02,000 --> 01:50:03,000
I'm going to come with me with this.

1962
01:50:03,000 --> 01:50:11,000
Oh, give me a shot.

1963
01:50:11,000 --> 01:50:12,000
That's a sniper coming.

1964
01:50:12,000 --> 01:50:15,000
Oh, that was beautiful.

1965
01:50:15,000 --> 01:50:17,000
Yeah, that was a shot.

1966
01:50:17,000 --> 01:50:18,000
Good.

1967
01:50:18,000 --> 01:50:19,000
Good.

1968
01:50:19,000 --> 01:50:21,000
Yeah, this guy, this guy is.

1969
01:50:21,000 --> 01:50:22,000
Let's get him.

1970
01:50:22,000 --> 01:50:23,000
Here we go.

1971
01:50:23,000 --> 01:50:24,000
Nice.

1972
01:50:24,000 --> 01:50:26,000
Yeah, buddy.

1973
01:50:26,000 --> 01:50:27,000
Oh, I got it.

1974
01:50:27,000 --> 01:50:29,000
I don't need it.

1975
01:50:29,000 --> 01:50:32,000
Oh, that was an air shot.

1976
01:50:32,000 --> 01:50:34,000
That was a pretty close air shot.

1977
01:50:34,000 --> 01:50:38,000
I don't know if I would really count that.

1978
01:50:38,000 --> 01:50:40,000
I'd get the more ammo and come back.

1979
01:50:40,000 --> 01:50:41,000
Fight.

1980
01:50:41,000 --> 01:50:42,000
Oh, blah.

1981
01:50:42,000 --> 01:50:45,000
I got a four core quad core.

1982
01:50:45,000 --> 01:50:50,000
Four cores.

1983
01:50:50,000 --> 01:50:58,000
Oh, that was interesting, I guess.

1984
01:50:58,000 --> 01:51:05,000
And I just did the spin fuser.

1985
01:51:05,000 --> 01:51:08,000
Are you still carrying the flag, MLC?

1986
01:51:08,000 --> 01:51:09,000
Yeah, this guy just walked right.

1987
01:51:09,000 --> 01:51:10,000
He's like, flew right by you.

1988
01:51:10,000 --> 01:51:14,000
I get whatever I'm going to come and chase you.

1989
01:51:14,000 --> 01:51:16,000
Next, I'm going to come back to you.

1990
01:51:16,000 --> 01:51:17,000
Are you all right?

1991
01:51:17,000 --> 01:51:18,000
Are you dead?

1992
01:51:18,000 --> 01:51:19,000
What are you doing, still?

1993
01:51:19,000 --> 01:51:20,000
Oh, no.

1994
01:51:20,000 --> 01:51:24,000
I probably went forth my problem.

1995
01:51:24,000 --> 01:51:27,000
Oh, you got people on you now.

1996
01:51:27,000 --> 01:51:30,000
Oh, did they find a guy with the same old flag?

1997
01:51:30,000 --> 01:51:35,000
If I could not be such a slug, I would come over there.

1998
01:51:35,000 --> 01:51:37,000
They're not going to be able to count.

1999
01:51:37,000 --> 01:51:38,000
Juggernaut.

2000
01:51:38,000 --> 01:51:41,000
Why do you forsake me?

2001
01:51:41,000 --> 01:51:46,000
You heard Juggernaut, though, what do you can't keep up?

2002
01:51:46,000 --> 01:51:53,000
I'm pretty much in molasses right now.

2003
01:51:53,000 --> 01:51:56,000
I always do.

2004
01:51:56,000 --> 01:51:58,000
Oh, they're trying to slide me.

2005
01:51:58,000 --> 01:52:01,000
Yeah, they got a couple of snipers actually.

2006
01:52:01,000 --> 01:52:08,000
Let's get some f in speed here.

2007
01:52:08,000 --> 01:52:12,000
What live?

2008
01:52:12,000 --> 01:52:14,000
I look at that slug.

2009
01:52:14,000 --> 01:52:16,000
I missed him.

2010
01:52:16,000 --> 01:52:19,000
I can't even go chase him either.

2011
01:52:19,000 --> 01:52:22,000
I'm like the heavy weapons guy.

2012
01:52:22,000 --> 01:52:25,000
No, that's a character in swivel.

2013
01:52:25,000 --> 01:52:28,000
Oh, I finally got it.

2014
01:52:28,000 --> 01:52:33,000
Oh, wait. Am I actually going to move more than two miles for our own?

2015
01:52:33,000 --> 01:52:35,000
Oh, so what else picked up the flag?

2016
01:52:35,000 --> 01:52:36,000
Oh, great.

2017
01:52:36,000 --> 01:52:40,000
I'm going in the opposite direction that everybody is.

2018
01:52:40,000 --> 01:52:41,000
All right.

2019
01:52:41,000 --> 01:52:42,000
I have enough.

2020
01:52:42,000 --> 01:52:44,000
I'm changing the pathfinder.

2021
01:52:44,000 --> 01:52:45,000
Oh, my finebag.

2022
01:52:45,000 --> 01:52:48,000
Time to commit suicide.

2023
01:52:48,000 --> 01:52:51,000
That didn't even kill me.

2024
01:52:51,000 --> 01:52:52,000
Oh, what's that?

2025
01:52:52,000 --> 01:52:54,000
It's a big bouncing blue green ball.

2026
01:52:54,000 --> 01:52:55,000
Oh.

2027
01:52:55,000 --> 01:52:58,000
Is that you, the flag?

2028
01:52:58,000 --> 01:53:00,000
No, that's the clay.

2029
01:53:00,000 --> 01:53:01,000
Oh, so beautiful.

2030
01:53:01,000 --> 01:53:03,000
I'm going this way.

2031
01:53:03,000 --> 01:53:06,000
MLG Grandpa is on an offseason right now.

2032
01:53:06,000 --> 01:53:08,000
He'll be back in probably a couple weeks.

2033
01:53:08,000 --> 01:53:12,000
I'm assuming.

2034
01:53:12,000 --> 01:53:19,000
I'm going to go help protect the flag carrier.

2035
01:53:19,000 --> 01:53:22,000
I'm going to go help protect the flag carrier.

2036
01:53:22,000 --> 01:53:25,000
I'm going to go help protect the flag carrier.

2037
01:53:25,000 --> 01:53:26,000
Woohoo!

2038
01:53:26,000 --> 01:53:29,000
Hey, if you hit one of those water guys who's when they're going off,

2039
01:53:29,000 --> 01:53:31,000
it'll actually give you like a 10-air.

2040
01:53:31,000 --> 01:53:32,000
Really?

2041
01:53:32,000 --> 01:53:33,000
Yeah, it's going to be a 10-air.

2042
01:53:33,000 --> 01:53:34,000
Yeah, it's going to be a 10-air.

2043
01:53:34,000 --> 01:53:36,000
They're going off on the mountains.

2044
01:53:36,000 --> 01:53:39,000
The best two maps are this one and the one we're going to play next.

2045
01:53:39,000 --> 01:53:43,000
And the worst ones I love are the ones I've just got done playing.

2046
01:53:43,000 --> 01:53:44,000
That's my opinion.

2047
01:53:44,000 --> 01:53:51,000
I like for Castle on the best.

2048
01:53:51,000 --> 01:53:52,000
What did you put?

2049
01:53:52,000 --> 01:53:56,000
What just hit me?

2050
01:53:56,000 --> 01:53:59,000
That guy doesn't got a...

2051
01:53:59,000 --> 01:54:07,000
Let's go on this way.

2052
01:54:07,000 --> 01:54:13,000
Guys, on the top.

2053
01:54:13,000 --> 01:54:15,000
No.

2054
01:54:15,000 --> 01:54:21,000
Yeah, sweet grenade bliss.

2055
01:54:21,000 --> 01:54:23,000
Dremel, you have 10,000 credits.

2056
01:54:23,000 --> 01:54:26,000
These are your super duper...

2057
01:54:26,000 --> 01:54:27,000
Okay.

2058
01:54:27,000 --> 01:54:30,000
How many of you just left then?

2059
01:54:30,000 --> 01:54:33,000
You have three, four, five.

2060
01:54:33,000 --> 01:54:35,000
I'm just going to shoot it randomly over here.

2061
01:54:35,000 --> 01:54:38,000
Let's see if I end the game.

2062
01:54:38,000 --> 01:54:40,000
I don't even help take a shot at the back.

2063
01:54:40,000 --> 01:54:43,000
I think I end it with my strike.

2064
01:54:43,000 --> 01:54:45,000
Over the starts, huge.

2065
01:54:45,000 --> 01:54:48,000
I got like four or five kills of them.

2066
01:54:48,000 --> 01:54:51,000
Hey, 31 flag health medals.

2067
01:54:51,000 --> 01:54:52,000
Sick.

2068
01:54:52,000 --> 01:54:54,000
Simpsist, 999, yes.

2069
01:54:54,000 --> 01:55:01,000
The Alex is on that server.

2070
01:55:01,000 --> 01:55:04,000
Oh.

2071
01:55:04,000 --> 01:55:05,000
All right, though.

2072
01:55:05,000 --> 01:55:08,000
I think that's going to be up to the stream.

2073
01:55:08,000 --> 01:55:11,000
First place, second place, third place, fifth place.

2074
01:55:11,000 --> 01:55:13,000
Cool.

2075
01:55:13,000 --> 01:55:15,000
That's pretty legit.

2076
01:55:15,000 --> 01:55:16,000
Yeah.

2077
01:55:16,000 --> 01:55:19,000
Almost.

2078
01:55:19,000 --> 01:55:21,000
Yeah, sorry.

2079
01:55:21,000 --> 01:55:22,000
You didn't get in.

2080
01:55:22,000 --> 01:55:26,000
Sorry, I didn't get it in time, all right.

2081
01:55:26,000 --> 01:55:28,000
Let's do it for next time.

2082
01:55:28,000 --> 01:55:31,000
Yeah, no, I'm going for next time.

2083
01:55:31,000 --> 01:55:34,000
Yeah, thanks everybody for coming.

2084
01:55:34,000 --> 01:55:35,000
Appreciate it.

2085
01:55:35,000 --> 01:55:39,000
I'm going to play Quap to end the stream by yourself.

2086
01:55:39,000 --> 01:55:41,000
End the stream by myself.

2087
01:55:41,000 --> 01:55:44,000
I am.

2088
01:55:44,000 --> 01:55:49,000
I'm going to go get some butter toast because I just woke up and it's like five PM.

2089
01:55:49,000 --> 01:55:52,000
All right, well for bandwidth purposes, I'm going to just end the call.

2090
01:55:52,000 --> 01:55:54,000
No, I'm going to end the call because I'm the host.

2091
01:55:54,000 --> 01:55:57,000
All right, well, thanks for coming to the stream, guys.

2092
01:55:57,000 --> 01:56:00,000
All right, I want to see you next time.

2093
01:56:00,000 --> 01:56:04,000
Take your lead, is.

2094
01:56:04,000 --> 01:56:05,000
Cool.

2095
01:56:05,000 --> 01:56:06,000
All right, let's play a little Quap.

2096
01:56:06,000 --> 01:56:10,000
If you missed it, I'm going to upload this whole thing to YouTube, by the way.

2097
01:56:10,000 --> 01:56:16,000
So the whole thing will be on YouTube if you missed the beginning.

2098
01:56:16,000 --> 01:56:18,000
Quap.

2099
01:56:18,000 --> 01:56:21,000
Make sure this is even lined up.

2100
01:56:21,000 --> 01:56:24,000
Oh, what's this big annoying ad over here?

2101
01:56:24,000 --> 01:56:25,000
Oh my god.

2102
01:56:25,000 --> 01:56:26,000
I'm refreshing this.

2103
01:56:26,000 --> 01:56:28,000
That's like, can I give you a seizure?

2104
01:56:28,000 --> 01:56:32,000
Here we go.

2105
01:56:32,000 --> 01:56:35,000
Let's do it.

2106
01:56:35,000 --> 01:56:40,000
All right, I'm going to really take my time with this.

2107
01:56:40,000 --> 01:56:43,000
See if I can get the slug mode again.

2108
01:56:43,000 --> 01:56:45,000
Yeah, thank you, you guys have taken off.

2109
01:56:45,000 --> 01:56:46,000
Thank you so much for coming.

2110
01:56:46,000 --> 01:56:50,000
If you missed the beginning of the stream, it's going to be on YouTube in the next probably a couple of hours.

2111
01:56:50,000 --> 01:56:54,000
Whenever YouTube decides to process it, who knows how long that's going to take.

2112
01:56:54,000 --> 01:56:57,000
But yeah, it's ended on this one last one.

2113
01:56:57,000 --> 01:56:58,000
Come on.

2114
01:56:58,000 --> 01:57:00,000
Now I'm going backwards.

2115
01:57:00,000 --> 01:57:03,000
It's not what I want to do.

2116
01:57:03,000 --> 01:57:12,000
If I get 10 meters, I'll be happy.

2117
01:57:12,000 --> 01:57:16,000
That's all I care about.

2118
01:57:16,000 --> 01:57:18,000
Oh, yeah.

2119
01:57:18,000 --> 01:57:20,000
Feel like I'm doing a dance move.

2120
01:57:20,000 --> 01:57:24,000
Like stick your left leg out.

2121
01:57:24,000 --> 01:57:28,000
That's going to be the oh my god.

2122
01:57:28,000 --> 01:57:31,000
I can't go forward.

2123
01:57:31,000 --> 01:57:34,000
My right leg is always the leg that I can never use.

2124
01:57:34,000 --> 01:57:35,000
I don't know why.

2125
01:57:35,000 --> 01:57:39,000
It always ends up like that.

2126
01:57:39,000 --> 01:57:46,000
And that's when we fall backwards.

2127
01:57:46,000 --> 01:57:48,000
But yeah, thank you so much guys.

2128
01:57:48,000 --> 01:57:49,000
I'm going to end up with that.

2129
01:57:49,000 --> 01:57:54,000
I am tired.
