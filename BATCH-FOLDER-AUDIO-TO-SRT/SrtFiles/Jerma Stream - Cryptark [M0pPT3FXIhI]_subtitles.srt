1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:14,000
Hey, good afternoon guys. How you doing? Good afternoon.

2
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:33,000
I think we're ready to go.

3
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:51,000
Hello. So I got to apologize right off the bat. This I'm in my new office kind of area in this place.

4
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:59,000
And I'm in the process of putting up like sound panels. But it's still a little echoey in here. So I got to, uh,

5
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:11,000
gotta say sorry. Until that's all done, it's going to be a little roomy in here by you know, whatever.

6
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:24,000
My new, yeah, my, this is the office where I get new. It is my nude office. I just get nude in here.

7
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:38,000
All right. So today, what's tonight? We're going to play a cryptarch. It's a game that came out in early access. Not that long ago a couple days ago or so.

8
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:53,000
It's a kind of rogue like space shooter sort of twin stick bullet hell type game. That's kind of a weird way to describe it. It's not really that. It's more like a try to take money from spaceship game.

9
00:01:53,000 --> 00:02:07,000
I actually really don't even know I have no idea. I just know what I've read about it. But apparently very good things I've heard extremely good things about this game.

10
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:16,000
And there's no reason why we're playing this game to this is another very specific reason why we're going to play this game. You'll see very soon.

11
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:28,000
You like my hold on a second screen? I literally drew this in less than 15 seconds.

12
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:43,000
So we'll let some people trickle in before we do this.

13
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:55,000
Can I sell your DNA on the internet for money? Oh, no. No, that's it. That's pretty fucked up.

14
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:08,000
My initial question, would you get it? Where the hell did you get this?

15
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:27,000
I'm not playing sticks. No, I'm not playing sticks. Okay, let me get this up.

16
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:36,000
I actually have heard of keep talking. Nobody explodes seems really really fun. Don't you need like three or four people to play that game though?

17
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:46,000
It's a game we have like at least three people, right?

18
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:55,000
Sometimes it's 1130 right now. 1126.

19
00:03:55,000 --> 00:04:02,000
Only two. You only need two people? That's pretty sweet. Maybe me and Starkim played at some point.

20
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:15,000
Or somebody else who doesn't matter who it is.

21
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:19,000
007, I remember that 007 was such a good game.

22
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:26,000
First time, that was like way ahead of its time. That like FPS multiplayer type game that was never...

23
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:36,000
It was like the first of its kind really. It definitely matters who it is. Well, it doesn't really matter.

24
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:42,000
Well, you don't think that would be equally as entertaining with like boo or like MLC stuff.

25
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:54,000
Doesn't always have to be star guys. Plus star is in prison. How am I going to play with them?

26
00:04:54,000 --> 00:05:05,000
Pax East is not until next year, man. Not until like April or something next year. From March or whatever.

27
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:14,000
Alright, well, I'm gonna get gone. I just want to give it a minute or two so if you look at kind of trickle in.

28
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:24,000
We're gonna open this game up. This game is apparently very hard so please don't be mad at me if I can't do this well.

29
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:33,000
So let's do it.

30
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:39,000
And get the hold on to the second screen off.

31
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:43,000
Hey, look at that. There's a video game on the screen now.

32
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:51,000
Alright, so let's play it. I don't know a whole lot. I know it's a shooter kind of side-scrolling top-down.

33
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:57,000
Break in, steal the stuff, take the core, get out. But whatever. Let's just go.

34
00:05:57,000 --> 00:06:06,000
I actually have played this game for like 30 seconds. So I don't really know a whole lot.

35
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:12,000
But I do know this. Let's take the last shot. Let's go ahead and do the tutorial.

36
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:17,000
Why not? You know, sometimes when you start a new game up, how are you supposed to know how to play?

37
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:21,000
You know, you got to do the goddamn tutorial.

38
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:29,000
Let's watch.

39
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:40,000
I'll leave those characters.

40
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:57,000
Let's go.

41
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:09,000
Oh, yeah.

42
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:42,000
The straggler will be a good target to stretch our legs and test the temperature of the water.

43
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:49,000
Yeah, I don't know nothing about this game. I just know like the first 30 seconds.

44
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:52,000
So we're going to take over this ship.

45
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:56,000
Difficulty one class and void goal time 407.

46
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:59,000
Okay.

47
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:04,000
Let's go ahead and launch.

48
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:10,000
Let's load up this first level.

49
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:30,000
Who the fuck's that?

50
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:34,000
Who's this one? Who's this one? Who's this one? The fuck are talking right now?

51
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:36,000
Let's go.

52
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:42,000
All right. So this is what it looks like.

53
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:45,000
And that's me.

54
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:51,000
Hold, eat open doors. Okay. Easy.

55
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:57,000
Right. Let's go down to checklist here and make sure you didn't knock any screws loose on a trip over.

56
00:08:57,000 --> 00:09:03,000
The old gun he is got four weapon hard points and four item brackets.

57
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:06,000
Yeah, yeah. Move the mouse to aim.

58
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:14,000
To the controls. It's pretty smooth.

59
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:18,000
The ramp spike should punch a hole through anything that gets too close.

60
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:20,000
Now I get up.

61
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:22,000
That's pretty cool.

62
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:26,000
That's hard. That's awkward. Hard to even see where I'm going.

63
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:34,000
All right. Grenade is F.

64
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:37,000
I might rewind that.

65
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:41,000
Finally, fire up that shield generator.

66
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:45,000
And rather you burn out the power cell and bring my soup back with holes in it.

67
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:47,000
And that's the shield.

68
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:50,000
All right.

69
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:53,000
There's the dash, the shield.

70
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:55,000
Interesting.

71
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:02,000
Why didn't you actually learn an extra terrestrial language to prepare for your role?

72
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:05,000
A painful display.

73
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:09,000
Okay. Let's see what we're looking at here.

74
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:11,000
Pull up your tactical map.

75
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:14,000
Now let's figure out a plan of attack.

76
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:17,000
Open up a map.

77
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:19,000
This here is our primary objective.

78
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:24,000
The core. All defensive bodies appear to be networked to this centralized AI cortex.

79
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:28,000
I'll go out to corn. The ship will be powerless.

80
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:31,000
This is all important information that I'm learning for the first time.

81
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:33,000
So bear with me if I'm being like, silent.

82
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:36,000
First, this active shield system will have to be taken offline.

83
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:40,000
It looks to be protective of core with some sort of energy field.

84
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:43,000
Take a take out the shield.

85
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:49,000
Scanners. We've also indicates multiple other security systems are active as well.

86
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:54,000
Take a look around and plan to take out modules that might be a problem.

87
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:57,000
It's kind of like the swindle.

88
00:10:57,000 --> 00:11:00,000
Right?

89
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:05,000
By the way, this is all procedurally generated, I believe.

90
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:08,000
So.

91
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:10,000
We can just take a look at, okay, this is the shield.

92
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:13,000
It protects a single system with an impenetrable energy shield.

93
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:16,000
So this is blocking this.

94
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:21,000
Okay, so this has to go down before the core can be destroyed.

95
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:24,000
Controls the multitude of interior defense turrets.

96
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:27,000
So if I destroy this, there's turrets that are going to be here.

97
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:30,000
And all kinds of stuff. This is locked.

98
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:33,000
All right, let's just go. Let's just play.

99
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:36,000
Let's do it. That's nothing else I can really do here.

100
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:38,000
That's my shield.

101
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:40,000
I want to turn F.

102
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:43,000
I want to make it something else if I can.

103
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:46,000
I have a different button I'd like to do.

104
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:57,000
I don't know. I'm apparently going to need to use my other mouse.

105
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:59,000
Let's see. Most.

106
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:04,000
That works for me.

107
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:09,000
Did I do it?

108
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:16,000
Should have done it right.

109
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:21,000
I'm racing.

110
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:28,000
Yeah, I don't know why that didn't do it.

111
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:32,000
Did I use all the grenades?

112
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:38,000
Maybe I don't have any grenades left. Where's the indicator?

113
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:40,000
That's the mouse for.

114
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:43,000
It's not working.

115
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:45,000
Oh, now I'll just put it back to F.

116
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:56,000
I'll put it on Q. Maybe Q is probably easier.

117
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:58,000
Oh, whoops.

118
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:01,000
Q is my like change scene button.

119
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:05,000
Shit.

120
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:07,000
I'm going to.

121
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:13,000
We definitely can't make it Q.

122
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:15,000
Yeah, I don't know.

123
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:17,000
I guess I just may have to deal with it.

124
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:19,000
Because I can't get it to be mouse for.

125
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:20,000
All right, let's just play.

126
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:23,000
I just didn't have to add air long enough.

127
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:25,000
Iron air away.

128
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:27,000
Equipment expenses logged.

129
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:29,000
Start mission clock.

130
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:31,000
I believe there's a timer.

131
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:34,000
Oh, shit. It's going right now.

132
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:36,000
I didn't even plan my attack.

133
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:40,000
We're just going in the front door.

134
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:43,000
Okay, I get the shield is up to the top left, right?

135
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:51,000
Repair supply. I don't need to do that.

136
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:52,000
Whoa, okay, they can't hurt you.

137
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:53,000
These are turrets.

138
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:57,000
These turrets aren't here for sure.

139
00:13:57,000 --> 00:13:59,000
I got 1,400 of my machine gun, which is good.

140
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:02,000
Here's the shield.

141
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:07,000
Whoa.

142
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:10,000
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

143
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:11,000
Oh, it's a reflector.

144
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:12,000
That's a reflector.

145
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:13,000
Okay, I got it.

146
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:14,000
You got to be real careful.

147
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:17,000
I'm going to shoot some grenades in there.

148
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:21,000
That's the way to do it.

149
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:26,000
I can see that guy to the left.

150
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:30,000
This is pretty damn cool, though.

151
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:33,000
What is that?

152
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:36,000
I got to look at the Metroid mini map.

153
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:41,000
Key terminal.

154
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:43,000
I guess I got a key.

155
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:45,000
Apparently.

156
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:47,000
Is another key?

157
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:49,000
Let's open it up.

158
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:50,000
Ooh, I can now open that.

159
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:51,000
I get it.

160
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:54,000
I get it.

161
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:57,000
Help is in the bottom.

162
00:14:57,000 --> 00:15:00,000
The brain is up here, but I have like two minutes.

163
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:02,000
Maybe I should go down and...

164
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:04,000
Okay, tech advance.

165
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:07,000
What does this do?

166
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:16,000
Okay.

167
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:19,000
So I picked these up to get better shit.

168
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:20,000
Thanks me.

169
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:23,000
Thanks for telling me how to play.

170
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:26,000
I am running out of time.

171
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:31,000
No, I don't get anymore ammo after this.

172
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:36,000
I probably should just try to do the first little tutorial area first.

173
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:37,000
Up here, right?

174
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:40,000
Yeah, there it is.

175
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:47,000
Here's the brain.

176
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:55,000
I only got a minute and 40 seconds left.

177
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:58,000
I got to get these little shits out of the purge.

178
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:03,000
That's important.

179
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:06,000
This is like quadrants of the brain.

180
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:09,000
That's pretty sick.

181
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:13,000
Ow.

182
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:16,000
Ow, ow, ow, ow, ow.

183
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:18,000
Oh boy, not good.

184
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:21,000
Probably should have taken out the turret system.

185
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:24,000
Oh boy.

186
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:33,000
I'm getting yelled at.

187
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:35,000
So I got to go to...

188
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:38,000
I get to repair pod.

189
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:41,000
Are these things spawning from somewhere?

190
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:43,000
I thought I killed these guys.

191
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:46,000
Okay, I have one on me.

192
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:53,000
There we go.

193
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:59,000
I got free rein to kill the brain.

194
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:02,000
Boink.

195
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:04,000
Got the code?

196
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:13,000
Yeah, I just scoled him by self.

197
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:18,000
That's the next level scolding.

198
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:21,000
All right.

199
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:28,000
All right.

200
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:41,000
So it costs money to attack.

201
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:44,000
Difficulty one.

202
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:46,000
These are all fairly simple except for that one.

203
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:51,000
These are both harder.

204
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:53,000
No supply pods.

205
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:55,000
These are those little bonuses.

206
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:59,000
That's cool.

207
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:01,000
They use dollars instead of galactic credits.

208
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:05,000
Oh, this is unrealistic.

209
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:07,000
94,000.

210
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:12,000
I'm gonna stay with the baby ships because I'm still learning the game.

211
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:15,000
Tech advances for...

212
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:19,000
Where's the cheapest one?

213
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:25,000
I got about five minutes to beat it.

214
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:36,000
Although long don't highly guarded multiple factory systems.

215
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:39,000
All right.

216
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:42,000
Hey, look at this.

217
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:44,000
We got a bit of some new equipment licenses.

218
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:46,000
We're getting a load on Rick here.

219
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:49,000
And I'll get you all cared up, Sunny.

220
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:50,000
Oh, that part was adlib.

221
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:51,000
You see there was no sunny there.

222
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:53,000
I see there was whatever the act.

223
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:56,000
Whoever the brilliant actor was added that little part of the end there.

224
00:18:56,000 --> 00:19:00,000
Just a little bit of an insight.

225
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:01,000
All right.

226
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:02,000
Let's get down to business.

227
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:03,000
You got four weapon points.

228
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:08,000
I can carry whatever hardware we got licenses for.

229
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:11,000
I modified the amount of whole durability your suit has as well.

230
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:15,000
Volta and our extra plating can get pricey though.

231
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:18,000
Lastly, there's four utility item brackets.

232
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:25,000
I can be loaded up with whatever goodies you think might come in handy.

233
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:26,000
Oh, so humble.

234
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:27,000
I'm just kidding.

235
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:28,000
There's a joke.

236
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:31,000
We're just choking here.

237
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:33,000
Okay.

238
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:34,000
So what do I have here?

239
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:36,000
This is 36,000.

240
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:39,000
I mean, what's my money?

241
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:42,000
I can also, can I sell it too?

242
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:49,000
I'm just going to go with default now.

243
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:50,000
So this is what I can put here.

244
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:52,000
I can only have a match catalog by type.

245
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:55,000
Be sure to let me know how much ammo you want for each gun too.

246
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:58,000
These things get hungry out there.

247
00:19:58,000 --> 00:20:01,000
I'm just like a coy.

248
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:02,000
So I can get keys.

249
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:04,000
I can bring a nuke.

250
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:08,000
I'm going to keep the fix.

251
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:09,000
Two fixes.

252
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:13,000
What's the key?

253
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:19,000
So I can get through one key and it's $8,000.

254
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:22,000
I don't think I can do one fix.

255
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:28,000
I should be all right.

256
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:31,000
What else we got here?

257
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:32,000
Geez.

258
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:35,000
There's even more weapons.

259
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:36,000
I don't...

260
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:40,000
The spike is cool, but...

261
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:43,000
Okay, shotgun.

262
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:45,000
224K.

263
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:48,000
Let me try the shotgun.

264
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:50,000
We'll go with 200.

265
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:52,000
Now I'm longevity with 100.

266
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:53,000
Just think I don't like it.

267
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:54,000
Yeah, 50.

268
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:57,000
Just in case I hate it.

269
00:20:57,000 --> 00:20:59,000
So the machine gun, that's fine.

270
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:02,000
Maybe 1500 is fine

271
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:09,000
Shield should probably stay there it helps

272
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:16,000
Bomb so we're gonna state the shield here the grenades

273
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:18,000
Sticky grenades

274
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:31,000
I was barely using these so I'm just gonna I'm gonna say zero

275
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:34,000
Save a little bit more bang for a buck

276
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:43,000
I'm gonna try shotgun and I will put on another thing of health

277
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:46,000
Be two more things to help

278
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:48,000
Get 500,000 dollars I

279
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:54,000
Get 69,000 for beating this so I can maybe I shouldn't be doing that

280
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:56,000
Because I know I'm just gonna be in the red

281
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:03,000
Fuck it whatever who cares that's the way we're gonna do it

282
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:08,000
How do I go?

283
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:11,000
There it is

284
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:20,000
Pay for equipment cost only long after you leave the hangar so feel free to just out new weapons on a target ship

285
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:23,000
Oh cool, so I can just use them

286
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:27,000
Ooh, I like the shotgun

287
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:34,000
Shotguns I should print them cool I

288
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:40,000
Think I'm liking this I think I am I like the shotgun. I'm gonna try shotgun shotty guy

289
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:49,000
What the fuck is this?

290
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:54,000
How did I get connected with this game?

291
00:22:54,000 --> 00:23:01,000
This is actually made by the same people that made a Pothion alien trap and the guy that was the casting

292
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:06,000
Director for Pothion is a guy that I have to know from the old voice acting communities and

293
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:11,000
He got me in touch again. He I auditioned and they liked it. So I'm in the game

294
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:14,000
That's that's pretty much it

295
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:16,000
Let's go steal some stuff. Let's go blow up a core

296
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:21,000
All right, let's look at this. I mean this is important

297
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:24,000
Here's the core

298
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:27,000
Alarm system

299
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:33,000
That protects the core is gonna be kind of harder

300
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:38,000
Well, this is tiny. This is a little one. Huh? This is a little baby ship. I forgot

301
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:42,000
So if I go in this door no, no if I go in this door

302
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:46,000
This is the thing that spawns enemies

303
00:23:49,000 --> 00:23:53,000
I'm gonna come in the back door destroy the thing that spawns the enemies

304
00:23:55,000 --> 00:23:56,000
Then

305
00:23:56,000 --> 00:24:00,000
Wrap around this way come up to destroy the alarm system and

306
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:07,000
Then core gets taken out nothing but net. Let's go

307
00:24:09,000 --> 00:24:16,000
Here, okay confirm loadout 88,000. I feel like this is very wasteful, but I'll learn that as we go

308
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:20,000
I only have four and a half minutes

309
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:23,000
Right in the back door

310
00:24:27,000 --> 00:24:29,000
Oh, lots of people down here

311
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:31,000
Oh

312
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:40,000
Holy shit

313
00:24:41,000 --> 00:24:46,000
This thing up above has hit me. I'm freaking out. I calm down. I got a calm down here

314
00:24:47,000 --> 00:24:51,000
I went way too. I went too fast. I should have just slowed down

315
00:24:51,000 --> 00:24:53,000
I

316
00:24:58,000 --> 00:25:00,000
Has to go a lot of hell

317
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:07,000
Oh shit alarm triggered what what I'm wow you just kicked the horn. It's nest careful about tripping those alarm sensors

318
00:25:07,000 --> 00:25:10,000
I see multiple contacts converging on your position

319
00:25:11,000 --> 00:25:16,000
Yeah, I did all the laser effects. Hey, all these sound effects in your I did them with my mouth

320
00:25:17,000 --> 00:25:19,000
No, that's not true

321
00:25:19,000 --> 00:25:23,000
They're very talented sound design on this game as well as their actors and

322
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:30,000
I'm taking away too many hits here

323
00:25:43,000 --> 00:25:48,000
Whoa, what the fuck is happening to my character? I'm getting pulled in and I just got sucked in all right

324
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:51,000
Note to self they suck you in don't know

325
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:56,000
Tech

326
00:25:57,000 --> 00:26:01,000
Key fuck give me that heel

327
00:26:07,000 --> 00:26:09,000
Am

328
00:26:09,000 --> 00:26:11,000
I

329
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:16,000
Can't hurt the brain, but it triggers the alarm

330
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:22,000
I'm out of repairs

331
00:26:23,000 --> 00:26:31,000
So maybe I should have brought I thought that was five no, okay, I get enough. That's five health points not five in the

332
00:26:31,000 --> 00:26:34,000
Slas and how many enemies there are quick

333
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:37,000
Get that tech upgrade. That's what I should have just said right there

334
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:42,000
I think we're just gonna go for it. I think we're just gonna go for just destroy it

335
00:26:43,000 --> 00:26:45,000
Well, it helped

336
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:50,000
Okay, all right get it

337
00:26:53,000 --> 00:26:55,000
That's lost a budget I just lost a hundred grand

338
00:26:58,000 --> 00:27:00,000
Shit

339
00:27:01,000 --> 00:27:03,000
That was cool though

340
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:10,000
Now that I know how that works and now we're back here and I believe these are all generated again

341
00:27:15,000 --> 00:27:17,000
We're gonna go with the baby one again

342
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:25,000
This time I'm gonna put multiple heels in now. I know triggering that did the alarm switches. I it's a list. It's pretty

343
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:28,000
Planned in work

344
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:34,000
Okay, let's go down get another deal

345
00:27:35,000 --> 00:27:40,000
That's 10,000 dollars. I think in an upgrade. What is this sensor?

346
00:27:41,000 --> 00:27:47,000
Deepwave red interceptor is in advance mole bat tunneling processor allows a sensor package to reveal a lighter area

347
00:27:49,000 --> 00:27:51,000
I don't think I need that yet

348
00:27:52,000 --> 00:28:00,000
15 grand for a nuke. I don't know. I'd rather just get another heel just cuz I'm a fucking shitty

349
00:28:03,000 --> 00:28:07,000
I'm doing I might as well like reset by the way, this is kind of like a rogue like when you're out of money

350
00:28:07,000 --> 00:28:09,000
I believe the game is over

351
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:13,000
I'm already down a hundred K

352
00:28:15,000 --> 00:28:18,000
Still have the shotgun still have the shield

353
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:22,000
And we'll go with that this time I'm gonna be a little bit more careful

354
00:28:25,000 --> 00:28:27,000
God that was a lot of money

355
00:28:29,000 --> 00:28:31,000
This one's the layout is a little different

356
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:36,000
Brain is down here at this time

357
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:42,000
All right, I'm just gonna be more guy. I got way too gung ho I just went straight in

358
00:28:43,000 --> 00:28:45,000
It's locked

359
00:28:45,000 --> 00:28:50,000
Just gotta be careful you just slow it down this is like it's kind of like binding a visor

360
00:28:50,000 --> 00:28:53,000
You know, I mean you don't just like run in the room and run around like a fucking psychopath

361
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:04,000
Couple attack upgrades here key

362
00:29:04,000 --> 00:29:20,000
You know it's open store. This is where the turrets are being shot

363
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:27,000
Claire out the little clear out the trash if you learned anything from World of Warcraft clear out the trash

364
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:33,000
Okay, that's gonna pull it that's gonna be hard to do

365
00:29:35,000 --> 00:29:41,000
This is scary

366
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:48,000
All right, sensory systems are now destroyed. I can move freely without getting aggro from them

367
00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:52,000
It's tech upgrade in here. I don't have key though

368
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:56,000
So now I

369
00:29:57,000 --> 00:29:59,000
Only a minute and a half left I gotta keep going

370
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:14,000
I'm running out of time running out of time

371
00:30:19,000 --> 00:30:26,000
It's have and have not this is a game of halves and have nots am I going the right way? No, no, I'm even close

372
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:30,000
Just I can go through here

373
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:39,000
Is there a way to get in this back way I would pull a planning

374
00:30:43,000 --> 00:30:45,000
One minute

375
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:50,000
No, there's no way I'm gonna do this in one minute

376
00:30:53,000 --> 00:30:57,000
Fuck it we gotta go I have 45 seconds to kill brain

377
00:30:59,000 --> 00:31:01,000
Wow time is not on your side in this game

378
00:31:01,000 --> 00:31:05,000
Go sound the alarm don't give a shit

379
00:31:10,000 --> 00:31:12,000
30 seconds

380
00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:21,000
Only five seconds thank God

381
00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:27,000
Who damn

382
00:31:31,000 --> 00:31:35,000
Your accounts captain stand by for salvage teams

383
00:31:37,000 --> 00:31:42,000
So my revenue was 100 and how much I spend 100 and something thousand

384
00:31:44,000 --> 00:31:50,000
So my my actual net like actual gain was like like 30 thousand dollars

385
00:31:51,000 --> 00:31:54,000
This is pretty cool. This is this is pretty cool. I

386
00:31:57,000 --> 00:31:59,000
Will say I am

387
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:02,000
Oh, would you look at that

388
00:32:03,000 --> 00:32:05,000
That's why this is cool so

389
00:32:06,000 --> 00:32:09,000
You have a choice between four ships

390
00:32:11,000 --> 00:32:15,000
You can either spend a little bit more money do the really hard ones

391
00:32:16,000 --> 00:32:19,000
Because you have to go through these five slots see like down here

392
00:32:19,000 --> 00:32:23,000
And then how you gonna do one two three four five and then at the you get to the crypt are

393
00:32:23,000 --> 00:32:28,000
Let's go to the hard one. You know, let's just see I'm just curious now

394
00:32:28,000 --> 00:32:33,000
I'm gonna get my ass kicked, but I'm curious to see with like a three difficulty one is like I'm sure there's they go up to 10 or something

395
00:32:37,000 --> 00:32:42,000
Think of all the slabs of granted you could have bought with that money quite a few

396
00:32:43,000 --> 00:32:48,000
We're gonna do the really really ultra super level two hard one

397
00:32:49,000 --> 00:32:51,000
This one looks pretty big too

398
00:32:52,000 --> 00:32:54,000
Six and a half minutes

399
00:32:56,000 --> 00:33:02,000
Destroy the sensor jammers for next year 34k this is go for

400
00:33:11,000 --> 00:33:15,000
We got another we got another tutorial. Oh, no, we don't

401
00:33:21,000 --> 00:33:25,000
What do I have for this heavy machine gun ricochet

402
00:33:31,000 --> 00:33:33,000
Lots of recoil, but they wreckage the bullets ricochet

403
00:33:38,000 --> 00:33:40,000
How much is what's the price difference?

404
00:33:42,000 --> 00:33:44,000
Medium machine gun burst smart

405
00:33:51,000 --> 00:33:53,000
Advanced smart gun

406
00:33:56,000 --> 00:33:58,000
Zip gun

407
00:34:01,000 --> 00:34:06,000
Let's let go with the zip gun how much money is the zip gun comparison? No, if I much more zip gun

408
00:34:07,000 --> 00:34:09,000
3000 bolts

409
00:34:17,000 --> 00:34:19,000
I'm gonna stay with the shotgun

410
00:34:20,000 --> 00:34:23,000
Yeah, it's kind of tried and true right

411
00:34:24,000 --> 00:34:29,000
Already bolts 50 50's been working pretty well. You could probably even go lower now you can only go 50

412
00:34:33,000 --> 00:34:35,000
Actually, I want to put this

413
00:34:36,000 --> 00:34:40,000
Okay, let's do 10 grenades on mouse three

414
00:34:43,000 --> 00:34:45,000
Most to now no

415
00:34:45,000 --> 00:34:47,000
No, no

416
00:34:48,000 --> 00:34:51,000
That shield is too good you can't take this off

417
00:34:55,000 --> 00:34:57,000
What does this do?

418
00:34:57,000 --> 00:34:59,000
Blaster

419
00:35:02,000 --> 00:35:05,000
If the zip gun isn't voice acted by Jeremiah

420
00:35:08,000 --> 00:35:13,000
I'll stay with the shield for now. I don't want to I mean I should take grenades, but I wish I could just change the key bind

421
00:35:14,000 --> 00:35:18,000
F is kind of awkward depressed when most 90% of the stuff you're doing is on the mouse

422
00:35:20,000 --> 00:35:22,000
But whatever

423
00:35:23,000 --> 00:35:25,000
Didn't I find something else here? No?

424
00:35:27,000 --> 00:35:31,000
I'm gonna take a key now that I like kind of know what the hell's going on

425
00:35:32,000 --> 00:35:36,000
I think I'm okay with having one of these fixers

426
00:35:36,000 --> 00:35:45,000
Because I I barely took any damage that last run now that I know not to be like us psychopath about everything

427
00:35:47,000 --> 00:35:49,000
You can even you can take this down

428
00:35:51,000 --> 00:35:59,000
Right, so you could if you were confident enough you could save yourself like $40,000 if you knew you were gonna get more than one time or two times

429
00:36:03,000 --> 00:36:05,000
Where's gonna go with you know, we're gonna go with eight

430
00:36:06,000 --> 00:36:12,000
This is this is a $74,000 mission. I get a hundred and forty one if I beat it and the bonuses

431
00:36:13,000 --> 00:36:16,000
Let's just get our asses kicked why not huh?

432
00:36:19,000 --> 00:36:21,000
Let's take a look at what we're dealing with

433
00:36:24,000 --> 00:36:26,000
Fuck

434
00:36:32,000 --> 00:36:34,000
Ah

435
00:36:36,000 --> 00:36:38,000
That's evil

436
00:36:41,000 --> 00:36:47,000
So I guess I could take one of those sensors, right? I'm gonna have those things I could do

437
00:36:56,000 --> 00:37:01,000
$8,000 to be able to see not that far in front of me. Let's try it

438
00:37:02,000 --> 00:37:04,000
We'll go for it

439
00:37:04,000 --> 00:37:06,000
I think does that mean I can see things now

440
00:37:18,000 --> 00:37:21,000
So this thing will repair other things that I've destroyed

441
00:37:22,000 --> 00:37:26,000
So that thing's got to go what is this that's the jammer if

442
00:37:27,000 --> 00:37:32,000
There's a way to get in right here or like here I can grab the intel

443
00:37:33,000 --> 00:37:39,000
Take out the drone factory repair system come around poke the thing in the eye

444
00:37:39,000 --> 00:37:46,000
Rip around get rid of the turret system swoop shoot bang shield generator down and the alarm system down

445
00:37:46,000 --> 00:37:48,000
Thank you very much. I'll take my 200 rent

446
00:37:50,000 --> 00:37:52,000
You you heard it here first

447
00:37:55,000 --> 00:37:57,000
So that's what that does

448
00:37:57,000 --> 00:37:59,000
Is it do right here? What do you know?

449
00:38:00,000 --> 00:38:02,000
We're gonna be good to go

450
00:38:03,000 --> 00:38:05,000
At least that's loud

451
00:38:07,000 --> 00:38:12,000
I'm sorry everybody that's very loud say it's the zip gun

452
00:38:13,000 --> 00:38:16,000
Oh god forgot I forgot where am I oh

453
00:38:18,000 --> 00:38:20,000
That just totally ruined my whole plan get me out of here

454
00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:28,000
Bye, I'm going back to my original plan can I

455
00:38:32,000 --> 00:38:38,000
Shit come on. There's got to be like a secret entrance up here. I can break through right there is

456
00:38:45,000 --> 00:38:47,000
Ow

457
00:38:56,000 --> 00:38:58,000
This zip gun is sick

458
00:38:59,000 --> 00:39:02,000
I'm going for speed

459
00:39:12,000 --> 00:39:14,000
Branch gun

460
00:39:15,000 --> 00:39:17,000
Hard to shoot the zip gun in here because it's so inaccurate

461
00:39:21,000 --> 00:39:23,000
Goes with the brain

462
00:39:24,000 --> 00:39:26,000
Okay brain

463
00:39:29,000 --> 00:39:31,000
Fuck

464
00:39:33,000 --> 00:39:38,000
Easy easy careful take a take a meal I got five minutes

465
00:39:39,000 --> 00:39:41,000
In fact I could probably

466
00:39:43,000 --> 00:39:47,000
I might not I don't think I'm gonna get the brain just yet I got I got I went to the super dendron

467
00:39:49,000 --> 00:39:52,000
Throwing factory of oh shit. Oh, no, we gotta go

468
00:39:59,000 --> 00:40:01,000
Shield

469
00:40:02,000 --> 00:40:04,000
Not

470
00:40:04,000 --> 00:40:06,000
Big mistake

471
00:40:12,000 --> 00:40:15,000
I don't think I can hurt you this side yet that's not good

472
00:40:15,000 --> 00:40:29,000
All right, no, I got three health I got three health just

473
00:40:31,000 --> 00:40:33,000
Three HP no way

474
00:40:38,000 --> 00:40:41,000
Yeah, I didn't take out the repair thing because my everything got all screwed up

475
00:40:41,000 --> 00:40:45,000
Look at that money

476
00:40:47,000 --> 00:40:50,000
No supply pods I didn't destroy the jammers

477
00:40:54,000 --> 00:40:58,000
297k I'll take it

478
00:41:11,000 --> 00:41:13,000
Don't be messing around

479
00:41:16,000 --> 00:41:20,000
I'm pretty sure the only reason why I'm alive is he probably dude that's probably true

480
00:41:23,000 --> 00:41:25,000
These are bigger

481
00:41:28,000 --> 00:41:31,000
I don't know man look what's the what's the difference between these

482
00:41:33,000 --> 00:41:35,000
These ones more money, but

483
00:41:36,000 --> 00:41:38,000
Must just be more stuff

484
00:41:39,000 --> 00:41:42,000
See all those icons and lower right I don't even know what the hell any of those mean

485
00:41:49,000 --> 00:41:51,000
We'll play this one a little bit safer

486
00:41:53,000 --> 00:41:55,000
355

487
00:41:56,000 --> 00:41:58,000
Hey

488
00:41:58,000 --> 00:42:02,000
Would Benjamin Franklin have taken this like safe the safe way no he would have people to

489
00:42:02,000 --> 00:42:07,000
Start off the fucking goddamn revolution and been been like the best president we've ever had

490
00:42:08,000 --> 00:42:10,000
We're going with danger five

491
00:42:11,000 --> 00:42:13,000
How do you think you got on that hundred

492
00:42:14,000 --> 00:42:17,000
You think you got on that hundred by like taking a bath? No

493
00:42:18,000 --> 00:42:21,000
He was the best electric president we've ever had

494
00:42:24,000 --> 00:42:28,000
That Benjamin Franklin wasn't a president I just be but who cares?

495
00:42:29,000 --> 00:42:34,000
Only damn president on the money that's not on the money, you know, that's all the money

496
00:42:34,000 --> 00:42:36,000
Yeah

497
00:42:39,000 --> 00:42:41,000
I got a new weapon let's take a look at what it is

498
00:42:44,000 --> 00:42:46,000
I do like the zip gun

499
00:42:48,000 --> 00:42:51,000
Trench gun sought off double barrel shotgun

500
00:42:52,000 --> 00:42:54,000
Sload of reload

501
00:42:54,000 --> 00:42:56,000
Nothing compares to a brutal one to punch

502
00:42:57,000 --> 00:43:04,000
What if I do double shotgun that sounds kind of fun right?

503
00:43:10,000 --> 00:43:13,000
If we're doing a hard one, no, I don't know that doesn't seem like a good idea

504
00:43:18,000 --> 00:43:20,000
Try the other guns advanced smart gun

505
00:43:22,000 --> 00:43:24,000
It's too expensive

506
00:43:24,000 --> 00:43:28,000
Is it really worth it to have like a home made this one's homing and it's almost

507
00:43:29,000 --> 00:43:32,000
$15,000 $12,000 less expensive from more bullets

508
00:43:35,000 --> 00:43:39,000
We're gonna try I feel like that's not enough though

509
00:43:41,000 --> 00:43:43,000
We'll go with the default

510
00:43:43,000 --> 00:43:45,000
And we'll do the shot off shotgun

511
00:43:47,000 --> 00:43:49,000
Can't take the shield off it's too good

512
00:43:49,000 --> 00:43:54,000
I don't even care I don't even like the sensor

513
00:43:55,000 --> 00:43:58,000
That's $8,000. I don't need to spend at least not now

514
00:44:00,000 --> 00:44:02,000
Should I do it

515
00:44:04,000 --> 00:44:08,000
I could have double zip gun and below everybody's ear drums out

516
00:44:13,000 --> 00:44:15,000
I'll keep it on this is a big job I

517
00:44:17,000 --> 00:44:19,000
Like the key

518
00:44:20,000 --> 00:44:23,000
Hmm, I don't care about the grenades. It's money. I don't have to spend

519
00:44:30,000 --> 00:44:32,000
I feel like I'm gonna run out of ammo

520
00:44:33,000 --> 00:44:38,000
But it cares I'm gonna be a millionaire after this one anyways

521
00:44:49,000 --> 00:44:55,000
My day for sure me through in the direction you pointed really what does that mean?

522
00:45:00,000 --> 00:45:05,000
Okay, this gun is pretty amazing you can just go like this and shoot around corners

523
00:45:09,000 --> 00:45:11,000
I'm lots of looking how much ammo I'm blowing though

524
00:45:14,000 --> 00:45:16,000
Whoa

525
00:45:16,000 --> 00:45:18,000
That's gone in the game

526
00:45:18,000 --> 00:45:21,000
So I'd off shotgun is is probably the best look at this thing look at the spread I

527
00:45:23,000 --> 00:45:25,000
Like this loadout

528
00:45:27,000 --> 00:45:29,000
Oh stealthy like you like the voice

529
00:45:32,000 --> 00:45:34,000
Let's go, what's it?

530
00:45:36,000 --> 00:45:38,000
There's a lot of enemies here

531
00:45:46,000 --> 00:45:52,000
This one is so small, there's a ton of enemies but it's tiny.

532
00:45:52,000 --> 00:45:57,000
Provides all drones aboard the ship with additional 25% health.

533
00:45:57,000 --> 00:45:58,000
Shit.

534
00:46:00,000 --> 00:46:02,000
There's the point of entry.

535
00:46:04,000 --> 00:46:06,000
Ooh.

536
00:46:09,000 --> 00:46:13,000
This one's multiple ships connected together.

537
00:46:13,000 --> 00:46:15,000
How much time do I have 700 and a half minutes?

538
00:46:15,000 --> 00:46:17,000
Take it slow.

539
00:46:17,000 --> 00:46:20,000
I got a key, I can go right in here.

540
00:46:20,000 --> 00:46:22,000
Let's go.

541
00:46:26,000 --> 00:46:28,000
Actually, hold on.

542
00:46:30,000 --> 00:46:31,000
I can't get it.

543
00:46:31,000 --> 00:46:32,000
Yeah, I can.

544
00:46:32,000 --> 00:46:33,000
I have a key.

545
00:46:34,000 --> 00:46:36,000
This is scary.

546
00:46:36,000 --> 00:46:38,000
I'm scared of opening this door.

547
00:46:40,000 --> 00:46:42,000
Yeah, there's their shields.

548
00:46:42,000 --> 00:46:44,000
Wow.

549
00:46:47,000 --> 00:46:49,000
It's almost in every direction.

550
00:46:49,000 --> 00:46:51,000
Why did I do this one?

551
00:46:52,000 --> 00:46:54,000
Why did I do this for this hard one?

552
00:46:54,000 --> 00:46:56,000
Fucking Benjamin Franklin.

553
00:46:56,000 --> 00:47:01,000
I should have taken like the fucking Alexander fan grant.

554
00:47:01,000 --> 00:47:03,000
What her first name was?

555
00:47:03,000 --> 00:47:05,000
What was the name? Anthony Grant?

556
00:47:05,000 --> 00:47:07,000
What was that president?

557
00:47:07,000 --> 00:47:09,000
Oh my god.

558
00:47:09,000 --> 00:47:11,000
What?

559
00:47:11,000 --> 00:47:13,000
Get me out of here.

560
00:47:15,000 --> 00:47:18,000
Oh my god, my game is crashing.

561
00:47:18,000 --> 00:47:21,000
They're following me out of the ship.

562
00:47:26,000 --> 00:47:30,000
Oh wow, that was not prepared for that one.

563
00:47:30,000 --> 00:47:32,000
Ulysses S Grand.

564
00:47:32,000 --> 00:47:34,000
That was like a general.

565
00:47:34,000 --> 00:47:36,000
That wasn't even a president.

566
00:47:36,000 --> 00:47:39,000
They can't hurt me if I'm out here.

567
00:47:39,000 --> 00:47:41,000
Not like that.

568
00:47:44,000 --> 00:47:47,000
Just get away from these guys.

569
00:47:47,000 --> 00:47:50,000
Jesus.

570
00:47:53,000 --> 00:47:55,000
Tech, tech, tech, tech, tech, tech, tech uppers.

571
00:47:55,000 --> 00:47:57,000
Chain gun.

572
00:48:00,000 --> 00:48:01,000
This thing has a shield.

573
00:48:01,000 --> 00:48:03,000
This is bad.

574
00:48:03,000 --> 00:48:05,000
Are those green bubbles?

575
00:48:05,000 --> 00:48:07,000
What's next?

576
00:48:07,000 --> 00:48:09,000
Huge knockback.

577
00:48:09,000 --> 00:48:11,000
Why am I...

578
00:48:11,000 --> 00:48:14,000
Alright, their armor is down.

579
00:48:19,000 --> 00:48:22,000
Those turrets.

580
00:48:22,000 --> 00:48:24,000
Unbearable.

581
00:48:28,000 --> 00:48:31,000
Oh boy.

582
00:48:31,000 --> 00:48:34,000
That's it.

583
00:48:34,000 --> 00:48:37,000
Wait, that's not it?

584
00:48:37,000 --> 00:48:40,000
Is that not it?

585
00:48:40,000 --> 00:48:43,000
That's not it.

586
00:48:43,000 --> 00:48:46,000
So there's like a left for dead style.

587
00:48:46,000 --> 00:48:49,000
You got to get one last chance playing in this game.

588
00:48:54,000 --> 00:48:56,000
I can't tell it.

589
00:48:56,000 --> 00:48:59,000
I'm dead.

590
00:49:00,000 --> 00:49:04,000
How much money did I just lose?

591
00:49:09,000 --> 00:49:12,000
That hurts.

592
00:49:13,000 --> 00:49:16,000
You know, I was gonna get a poster of Benjamin Franklin

593
00:49:16,000 --> 00:49:19,000
and put him up on this wall back here.

594
00:49:19,000 --> 00:49:21,000
No.

595
00:49:21,000 --> 00:49:26,000
Now I'm gonna get a poster of...

596
00:49:27,000 --> 00:49:31,000
Dan Bush, like George Bush is like seventh cousin.

597
00:49:31,000 --> 00:49:35,000
Or like Bill Clinton.

598
00:49:35,000 --> 00:49:37,000
You know what?

599
00:49:37,000 --> 00:49:40,000
I think I'm gonna get a Bill Clinton poster.

600
00:49:40,000 --> 00:49:42,000
It's gonna go right there.

601
00:49:42,000 --> 00:49:45,000
Is it like a Bill Clinton poster with him with a cigar in his hand?

602
00:49:45,000 --> 00:49:46,000
Probably.

603
00:49:46,000 --> 00:49:49,000
Is like him just like leaning back like smiling with a cigar.

604
00:49:49,000 --> 00:49:52,000
Benjamin fucking Franklin.

605
00:49:52,000 --> 00:49:55,000
Unbelievable.

606
00:49:56,000 --> 00:49:59,000
Well, we lost a bunch of money.

607
00:49:59,000 --> 00:50:04,000
That one was very, very, very, very hard.

608
00:50:07,000 --> 00:50:12,000
Is there four or is it just three in five of this?

609
00:50:15,000 --> 00:50:17,000
Level three, we'll do it three.

610
00:50:17,000 --> 00:50:22,000
I'm not quite there yet to do the advanced level five ones.

611
00:50:23,000 --> 00:50:25,000
I don't think the...

612
00:50:25,000 --> 00:50:29,000
That Tracer Gundin shoot really fast enough for me.

613
00:50:34,000 --> 00:50:36,000
Oh, I got into weapon.

614
00:50:36,000 --> 00:50:38,000
I got a chain gun, right?

615
00:50:38,000 --> 00:50:41,000
Let's try that one.

616
00:50:41,000 --> 00:50:46,000
You lost 100,000 burger boys, not burger fans.

617
00:50:48,000 --> 00:50:51,000
I don't know why that's so funny to me.

618
00:50:51,000 --> 00:50:54,000
Burger boys, not burger fans.

619
00:50:54,000 --> 00:50:57,000
That's great.

620
00:51:01,000 --> 00:51:05,000
One spinning, they deliver a hurricane of weathering fire.

621
00:51:06,000 --> 00:51:08,000
Let's try it.

622
00:51:08,000 --> 00:51:11,000
I still like this shotgun.

623
00:51:11,000 --> 00:51:13,000
The...

624
00:51:13,000 --> 00:51:15,000
The trench gun.

625
00:51:15,000 --> 00:51:17,000
Do they make something else?

626
00:51:18,000 --> 00:51:22,000
I feel like something else could be here that I'm just not missing.

627
00:51:22,000 --> 00:51:24,000
Zip gun was a good choice too.

628
00:51:24,000 --> 00:51:26,000
Let's try the chain gun.

629
00:51:26,000 --> 00:51:30,000
No, but this is level three. This is not level five.

630
00:51:31,000 --> 00:51:33,000
Keep these.

631
00:51:33,000 --> 00:51:35,000
I'm gonna take another key.

632
00:51:35,000 --> 00:51:38,000
Just because how much are the keys?

633
00:51:38,000 --> 00:51:41,000
Hmm, whatever.

634
00:51:42,000 --> 00:51:45,000
One, two, three.

635
00:51:45,000 --> 00:51:47,000
One, two, three, four, five.

636
00:51:47,000 --> 00:51:50,000
I'm gonna do seven strength.

637
00:51:52,000 --> 00:51:54,000
That's a bad idea.

638
00:51:56,000 --> 00:51:59,000
Bad idea, but you know, we're gonna do it anyways.

639
00:51:59,000 --> 00:52:01,000
Let's see how it.

640
00:52:02,000 --> 00:52:04,000
Yeah!

641
00:52:04,000 --> 00:52:06,000
Yeah!

642
00:52:07,000 --> 00:52:10,000
Starts off slow.

643
00:52:10,000 --> 00:52:13,000
Then you get into face melting category in like two seconds.

644
00:52:13,000 --> 00:52:15,000
I like it. We're staying with it.

645
00:52:15,000 --> 00:52:18,000
Well, probably.

646
00:52:22,000 --> 00:52:26,000
This one, I didn't even look at it. I was pretty dumb.

647
00:52:31,000 --> 00:52:34,000
I'm gonna go in this door over here.

648
00:52:34,000 --> 00:52:36,000
Go in this door, grab the key.

649
00:52:36,000 --> 00:52:38,000
Make my way up.

650
00:52:38,000 --> 00:52:41,000
I'm gonna destroy the shield and the alarm.

651
00:52:41,000 --> 00:52:44,000
Because that also requires a key to get in there.

652
00:52:44,000 --> 00:52:47,000
Get a couple of these tech upgrades.

653
00:52:47,000 --> 00:52:51,000
Go down, swing all the way down inside the puzzle piece into the core.

654
00:52:51,000 --> 00:52:53,000
Let's go.

655
00:52:58,000 --> 00:53:01,000
It's gonna be a long trip to go all the way around.

656
00:53:01,000 --> 00:53:03,000
But it's worth it.

657
00:53:03,000 --> 00:53:05,000
At least I think.

658
00:53:05,000 --> 00:53:07,000
I hope.

659
00:53:07,000 --> 00:53:10,000
How many lines did I record for this game?

660
00:53:10,000 --> 00:53:13,000
Um, I'm in the right spot.

661
00:53:15,000 --> 00:53:17,000
I think like 40?

662
00:53:17,000 --> 00:53:19,000
50?

663
00:53:19,000 --> 00:53:21,000
30?

664
00:53:21,000 --> 00:53:24,000
Something like that.

665
00:53:25,000 --> 00:53:28,000
More than a handful, I would say.

666
00:53:29,000 --> 00:53:32,000
Things get kind of like unavoidably.

667
00:53:41,000 --> 00:53:43,000
Take the key.

668
00:53:43,000 --> 00:53:45,000
Let's go.

669
00:53:45,000 --> 00:53:48,000
Let's go up.

670
00:53:48,000 --> 00:53:50,000
The key.

671
00:53:50,000 --> 00:53:52,000
I don't need to be bringing that many keys.

672
00:53:52,000 --> 00:53:54,000
I already have like three.

673
00:53:54,000 --> 00:53:57,000
Here we go.

674
00:53:58,000 --> 00:54:01,000
This is gonna set off the alarm.

675
00:54:01,000 --> 00:54:04,000
Like cheese.

676
00:54:04,000 --> 00:54:07,000
I'm on.

677
00:54:07,000 --> 00:54:12,000
Having the double barrel shotgun shoot twice is gonna kill me.

678
00:54:20,000 --> 00:54:23,000
And.

679
00:54:28,000 --> 00:54:31,000
Oh, get it there.

680
00:54:31,000 --> 00:54:34,000
Shit, shit, shit, shit, shit, shit, shit, shit, shit, shit.

681
00:54:34,000 --> 00:54:37,000
Come on.

682
00:54:37,000 --> 00:54:39,000
I'm gonna have to hang out in there.

683
00:54:39,000 --> 00:54:41,000
Look at the mini map.

684
00:54:41,000 --> 00:54:44,000
Hold the fucking dog shit.

685
00:54:44,000 --> 00:54:46,000
This is insane.

686
00:54:46,000 --> 00:54:49,000
They're all scrambling just to funnel into this one room.

687
00:54:49,000 --> 00:54:52,000
Is this like hitman?

688
00:54:52,000 --> 00:54:55,000
Are they gonna dissipate if I don't touch them for a while?

689
00:54:55,000 --> 00:54:58,000
Where's the repair drone?

690
00:54:58,000 --> 00:55:01,000
Oh, no.

691
00:55:01,000 --> 00:55:04,000
No.

692
00:55:04,000 --> 00:55:08,000
Forgot that this thing existed.

693
00:55:08,000 --> 00:55:12,000
Where is it?

694
00:55:12,000 --> 00:55:15,000
Where is it?

695
00:55:15,000 --> 00:55:17,000
Where is it?

696
00:55:17,000 --> 00:55:19,000
Where is it?

697
00:55:20,000 --> 00:55:22,000
Where is it?

698
00:55:22,000 --> 00:55:25,000
Is it this far down?

699
00:55:25,000 --> 00:55:27,000
It's that far down.

700
00:55:27,000 --> 00:55:29,000
Should have done this first.

701
00:55:29,000 --> 00:55:33,000
Look back planning.

702
00:55:33,000 --> 00:55:35,000
It's okay.

703
00:55:35,000 --> 00:55:36,000
How much time do I got?

704
00:55:36,000 --> 00:55:37,000
Three minutes?

705
00:55:37,000 --> 00:55:39,000
It's alright.

706
00:55:39,000 --> 00:55:42,000
I just worked myself.

707
00:55:49,000 --> 00:55:59,000
It's alright.

708
00:55:59,000 --> 00:56:03,000
It's alright.

709
00:56:03,000 --> 00:56:07,000
It's alright.

710
00:56:07,000 --> 00:56:16,000
Shit.

711
00:56:16,000 --> 00:56:18,000
Shit, head.

712
00:56:18,000 --> 00:56:23,000
Put your shield down.

713
00:56:23,000 --> 00:56:38,000
Can I not kill these things?

714
00:56:38,000 --> 00:56:45,000
I'm out of ammo.

715
00:56:45,000 --> 00:56:52,000
Oh no.

716
00:56:52,000 --> 00:56:58,000
Oh no.

717
00:56:58,000 --> 00:57:03,000
Oh no.

718
00:57:03,000 --> 00:57:09,000
Get these like snakes.

719
00:57:09,000 --> 00:57:16,000
Get out of here.

720
00:57:16,000 --> 00:57:24,000
I'm out of ammo.

721
00:57:24,000 --> 00:57:34,000
On every gun.

722
00:57:34,000 --> 00:57:37,000
You got, yeah, you called it not enough ammo.

723
00:57:37,000 --> 00:57:40,000
I didn't, I shouldn't have.

724
00:57:40,000 --> 00:57:45,000
I really like this game.

725
00:57:45,000 --> 00:57:54,000
This is really, really cool.

726
00:57:54,000 --> 00:58:01,000
Well, we're officially lost almost all the money that I have in my bank.

727
00:58:01,000 --> 00:58:08,000
Chain gun, I'm going to have to go back to tried and true zip gun, man.

728
00:58:08,000 --> 00:58:09,000
Let's go to this one.

729
00:58:09,000 --> 00:58:13,000
I've got a couple of new things, but I could do double zip gun.

730
00:58:13,000 --> 00:58:15,000
You know, we're going to try it.

731
00:58:15,000 --> 00:58:18,000
We'll try double zip gun.

732
00:58:18,000 --> 00:58:24,000
I wonder if it's even possible.

733
00:58:24,000 --> 00:58:26,000
Look at how much money that is.

734
00:58:26,000 --> 00:58:30,000
No wonder it's that much money because you can just spam it.

735
00:58:30,000 --> 00:58:37,000
Heavy machine gun piercing.

736
00:58:37,000 --> 00:58:38,000
I fire.

737
00:58:38,000 --> 00:58:42,000
That's a piercing ammunition auto stabilizer.

738
00:58:42,000 --> 00:58:43,000
Heip ring suit.

739
00:58:43,000 --> 00:58:46,000
So this slows you down a lot.

740
00:58:46,000 --> 00:58:48,000
Yeah, do we even need to read that?

741
00:58:48,000 --> 00:58:51,000
Or are we just getting two zip guns?

742
00:58:51,000 --> 00:58:52,000
You know what I mean?

743
00:58:52,000 --> 00:58:58,000
I don't even know if we really need to read any of that shit.

744
00:58:58,000 --> 00:59:05,000
That's what I'm...

745
00:59:05,000 --> 00:59:08,000
That's awesome.

746
00:59:08,000 --> 00:59:15,000
Oh, that's so cool.

747
00:59:15,000 --> 00:59:26,000
That's enough ammo, too, I think.

748
00:59:26,000 --> 00:59:28,000
All right.

749
00:59:28,000 --> 00:59:30,000
That is going to be enough ammo.

750
00:59:30,000 --> 00:59:33,000
I hope.

751
00:59:33,000 --> 00:59:35,000
Don't need two keys.

752
00:59:35,000 --> 00:59:36,000
You get keys pretty easily.

753
00:59:36,000 --> 00:59:40,000
The sensor is okay to stay.

754
00:59:40,000 --> 00:59:43,000
I'll keep the one key, the one healer, and now we've got double zip guns,

755
00:59:43,000 --> 00:59:49,000
so the game's pretty much over, you know.

756
00:59:49,000 --> 00:59:58,000
Then many things are going to get now away now there, and they're insane.

757
00:59:58,000 --> 01:00:03,000
Now, let me think about this for a second rather than just be a moron and say,

758
01:00:03,000 --> 01:00:05,000
oh, Jesus, get out of the dish.

759
01:00:05,000 --> 01:00:07,000
And now I go.

760
01:00:07,000 --> 01:00:09,000
This is repair system.

761
01:00:09,000 --> 01:00:11,000
This has to go.

762
01:00:11,000 --> 01:00:13,000
This thing has to go first.

763
01:00:13,000 --> 01:00:16,000
Otherwise, if I destroy this, it doesn't matter.

764
01:00:16,000 --> 01:00:18,000
Although, yeah, if I destroy this, it won't matter.

765
01:00:18,000 --> 01:00:22,000
Like, all those repair facilities, these things have to go.

766
01:00:22,000 --> 01:00:26,000
So there's one in here, there's only one.

767
01:00:26,000 --> 01:00:29,000
So we've got to go down, and then we've got to go all the way back up again,

768
01:00:29,000 --> 01:00:32,000
up to here, or even right over to here.

769
01:00:32,000 --> 01:00:34,000
So this is the point of entry.

770
01:00:34,000 --> 01:00:36,000
Actually, this is good because the turrets thing is right here.

771
01:00:36,000 --> 01:00:37,000
We've got double zip gun.

772
01:00:37,000 --> 01:00:43,000
We're going in that spot right there to the lower right, but let's go.

773
01:00:43,000 --> 01:00:47,000
We're almost out of money, so this is our last chance to pull this out of the fire.

774
01:00:47,000 --> 01:00:49,000
Oh, shit. We're out of money.

775
01:00:49,000 --> 01:00:52,000
If we don't deliver this ship to the contractors, we'll be out of a job.

776
01:00:52,000 --> 01:00:54,000
And that's where the game ends.

777
01:00:54,000 --> 01:00:57,000
All right, I can't lose this one.

778
01:00:57,000 --> 01:00:59,000
I physically cannot lose this.

779
01:00:59,000 --> 01:01:02,000
Otherwise, the game's over.

780
01:01:02,000 --> 01:01:04,000
So you know what they say.

781
01:01:04,000 --> 01:01:06,000
Double zip gun.

782
01:01:19,000 --> 01:01:21,000
Move, move, move, move.

783
01:01:23,000 --> 01:01:26,000
I got places to be, places to be.

784
01:01:26,000 --> 01:01:28,000
I got a key. I can open the store.

785
01:01:28,000 --> 01:01:30,000
Good.

786
01:01:35,000 --> 01:01:37,000
Fuck you.

787
01:01:42,000 --> 01:01:44,000
All right, keep moving.

788
01:01:44,000 --> 01:01:46,000
We have to, this is a must win.

789
01:01:46,000 --> 01:01:49,000
This is a must win situation.

790
01:01:55,000 --> 01:01:57,000
We're only going to do one zip.

791
01:01:57,000 --> 01:01:59,000
One trigger.

792
01:01:59,000 --> 01:02:01,000
A key for getting about that.

793
01:02:01,000 --> 01:02:03,000
Two apples there.

794
01:02:03,000 --> 01:02:06,000
Don't want to run out of the ammo.

795
01:02:06,000 --> 01:02:08,000
I got plenty of time.

796
01:02:08,000 --> 01:02:10,000
Show.

797
01:02:17,000 --> 01:02:20,000
What's happening? What happened? What did I go?

798
01:02:26,000 --> 01:02:29,000
How do you knock the pistol at the end?

799
01:02:32,000 --> 01:02:34,000
Let's move.

800
01:02:34,000 --> 01:02:37,000
I got, I got, I got like a thousand rounds.

801
01:02:44,000 --> 01:02:46,000
Fuck it, whoa.

802
01:02:46,000 --> 01:02:49,000
Just blowing this whole thing.

803
01:02:50,000 --> 01:02:52,000
Like a wagon.

804
01:02:52,000 --> 01:02:55,000
There's the brain.

805
01:03:03,000 --> 01:03:05,000
Is this shield?

806
01:03:05,000 --> 01:03:07,000
All right, I get a shield for a second.

807
01:03:07,000 --> 01:03:09,000
I'm rolling out of ammo.

808
01:03:09,000 --> 01:03:11,000
Is there an ammo pod?

809
01:03:17,000 --> 01:03:20,000
I can't really look at him anymore.

810
01:03:22,000 --> 01:03:25,000
I can't really look at him anymore.

811
01:03:25,000 --> 01:03:28,000
I can't really look at him anymore.

812
01:03:28,000 --> 01:03:31,000
I can't really look at him anymore.

813
01:03:31,000 --> 01:03:34,000
Shit.

814
01:03:34,000 --> 01:03:37,000
It's going to be so hard to hit this and not get hit.

815
01:03:37,000 --> 01:03:40,000
I'm going to have to stand so close and just go like this.

816
01:03:46,000 --> 01:03:49,000
It's going to reflect it right in my face.

817
01:03:49,000 --> 01:03:52,000
I can't really look at him anymore.

818
01:04:04,000 --> 01:04:07,000
Brain? I got a full minute and a half.

819
01:04:14,000 --> 01:04:17,000
Slow it down, slow it down.

820
01:04:20,000 --> 01:04:22,000
Eat shit.

821
01:04:22,000 --> 01:04:24,000
Down to one.

822
01:04:24,000 --> 01:04:26,000
Down to one.

823
01:04:26,000 --> 01:04:28,000
Zip gun.

824
01:04:28,000 --> 01:04:30,000
I can't even tell.

825
01:04:30,000 --> 01:04:31,000
I can't even tell.

826
01:04:31,000 --> 01:04:34,000
This stupid motherfucker right here.

827
01:04:35,000 --> 01:04:38,000
No!

828
01:04:45,000 --> 01:04:47,000
Get it!

829
01:04:55,000 --> 01:04:59,000
Oh, wow.

830
01:04:59,000 --> 01:05:02,000
I thought I lost it right at the end.

831
01:05:02,000 --> 01:05:05,000
We live another day.

832
01:05:11,000 --> 01:05:12,000
You know what?

833
01:05:12,000 --> 01:05:15,000
I bet you after a couple more seconds of that, it would have lost.

834
01:05:15,000 --> 01:05:18,000
I would have lost again.

835
01:05:19,000 --> 01:05:22,000
Nice.

836
01:05:22,000 --> 01:05:23,000
Okay.

837
01:05:23,000 --> 01:05:26,000
Well, there's that.

838
01:05:26,000 --> 01:05:27,000
Double zip gun.

839
01:05:27,000 --> 01:05:28,000
All the way.

840
01:05:28,000 --> 01:05:31,000
It was all double zip gun.

841
01:05:32,000 --> 01:05:33,000
Four zip gun.

842
01:05:33,000 --> 01:05:35,000
It's probably possible.

843
01:05:35,000 --> 01:05:38,000
I don't know if I have the money.

844
01:05:42,000 --> 01:05:46,000
Class five, class six, now.

845
01:05:48,000 --> 01:05:54,000
I don't think I'm going to be able to beat that with the amount of money that I need to save.

846
01:05:55,000 --> 01:05:57,000
You know what?

847
01:05:57,000 --> 01:06:00,000
Multiple heals.

848
01:06:00,000 --> 01:06:02,000
A key.

849
01:06:02,000 --> 01:06:04,000
You know what? Let's try it.

850
01:06:04,000 --> 01:06:08,000
I'm going to spend my entire bank account.

851
01:06:12,000 --> 01:06:16,000
This is a huge payout if I can beat this though.

852
01:06:20,000 --> 01:06:23,000
If I can actually beat this, it's a pretty large payout.

853
01:06:24,000 --> 01:06:27,000
So, you know, we're just going to...

854
01:06:36,000 --> 01:06:38,000
Can I do this?

855
01:06:55,000 --> 01:07:00,000
Alright, guys, I'm going to say...

856
01:07:00,000 --> 01:07:05,000
This is really, really, really cool.

857
01:07:05,000 --> 01:07:08,000
This is great.

858
01:07:08,000 --> 01:07:13,000
So, being able to do something like this, people can just do whatever the hell they want.

859
01:07:13,000 --> 01:07:15,000
To the detriment of your...

860
01:07:15,000 --> 01:07:18,000
We're doing four zip gun.

861
01:07:19,000 --> 01:07:24,000
I mean, you kind of have to.

862
01:07:27,000 --> 01:07:30,000
What we're going to do...here's what we're going to do.

863
01:07:30,000 --> 01:07:33,000
We're going to do four zip guns.

864
01:07:33,000 --> 01:07:37,000
With as much ammo as I can put in them all.

865
01:07:37,000 --> 01:07:40,000
What about chain guns? Let's try that.

866
01:07:40,000 --> 01:07:46,000
I'm just curious to see how much more outrageous the chain guns are with four of them.

867
01:07:49,000 --> 01:07:53,000
I should bring this back.

868
01:07:53,000 --> 01:07:58,000
I was dropping down to like four of you, so I'm trying to get that back right now.

869
01:07:58,000 --> 01:08:01,000
I can't even throw my car.

870
01:08:06,000 --> 01:08:09,000
Yeah, that one's too dangerous because I can't even move.

871
01:08:09,000 --> 01:08:12,000
So, we're not doing that. We're doing zip guns.

872
01:08:12,000 --> 01:08:14,000
Four zip guns and four heals.

873
01:08:14,000 --> 01:08:17,000
What's knock?

874
01:08:19,000 --> 01:08:24,000
So, this is...you kind of block projectiles?

875
01:08:26,000 --> 01:08:29,000
Oh, I wasn't even firing the fourth one.

876
01:08:41,000 --> 01:08:43,000
Let's just do it.

877
01:08:43,000 --> 01:08:47,000
Who cares? Let's do fucking five chain guns.

878
01:08:47,000 --> 01:08:51,000
Look at how much money this is. I'm not even going to be able to afford it.

879
01:08:51,000 --> 01:08:54,000
How much money do I have?

880
01:08:57,000 --> 01:09:01,000
Total bang. Okay, I'm out of money.

881
01:09:01,000 --> 01:09:04,000
Let's go. You guys ready to lose the game?

882
01:09:04,000 --> 01:09:07,000
I'm about ready to lose the game.

883
01:09:07,000 --> 01:09:09,000
I'm out of money. Game over.

884
01:09:09,000 --> 01:09:11,000
I have to win this Earth's game over.

885
01:09:11,000 --> 01:09:13,000
And I have four.

886
01:09:13,000 --> 01:09:16,000
I can't even control the character with W-A-S-D.

887
01:09:17,000 --> 01:09:20,000
I'm just gonna...no way. I can't do that. W-A-S-D.

888
01:09:20,000 --> 01:09:23,000
F, I have my hand on my mouse too.

889
01:09:23,000 --> 01:09:29,000
But, you know, with a little luck, we could just spare ourselves to victory.

890
01:09:30,000 --> 01:09:34,000
We'll take it easy at first. Those new hazards.

891
01:09:39,000 --> 01:09:41,000
Okay.

892
01:09:47,000 --> 01:09:50,000
It looks like interaction.

893
01:09:50,000 --> 01:09:55,000
Why is this working? Why is this working?

894
01:10:00,000 --> 01:10:04,000
It's like supernovaing. What the hell is going on here?

895
01:10:04,000 --> 01:10:08,000
That's gonna take up this whole place, ain't it?

896
01:10:17,000 --> 01:10:20,000
Which way I'm supposed to be going?

897
01:10:20,000 --> 01:10:24,000
Oh, this is gonna reflect and kill it.

898
01:10:24,000 --> 01:10:27,000
Oh, this...

899
01:10:27,000 --> 01:10:30,000
Let's get the brain. Give me the brain.

900
01:10:30,000 --> 01:10:34,000
Where's the brain? Where's the brain?

901
01:10:34,000 --> 01:10:39,000
Quick. Yeah. Try this.

902
01:10:39,000 --> 01:10:42,000
Dead.

903
01:10:42,000 --> 01:10:45,000
Where am I going?

904
01:10:45,000 --> 01:10:48,000
Where the hell is the brain?

905
01:10:48,000 --> 01:10:51,000
It's all the way over here.

906
01:10:51,000 --> 01:10:54,000
That...that's...

907
01:10:54,000 --> 01:10:57,000
I died.

908
01:10:57,000 --> 01:11:01,000
I died. I blew up.

909
01:11:01,000 --> 01:11:06,000
If I were to wait, if I went the right way, it would have worked.

910
01:11:06,000 --> 01:11:11,000
I'm okay with just losing all my money in the game being over.

911
01:11:11,000 --> 01:11:14,000
Let's see what happens.

912
01:11:15,000 --> 01:11:20,000
Oh, this guy is gonna kill me.

913
01:11:20,000 --> 01:11:24,000
Okay. That's fun being bankrupt.

914
01:11:24,000 --> 01:11:26,000
I guess.

915
01:11:26,000 --> 01:11:29,000
Out of fun's game over.

916
01:11:29,000 --> 01:11:33,000
Total score.

917
01:11:33,000 --> 01:11:36,000
Revenue. That's so cool.

918
01:11:36,000 --> 01:11:39,000
It gives you like a graph.

919
01:11:39,000 --> 01:11:42,000
Look at the kills near the end.

920
01:11:42,000 --> 01:11:49,000
You show that bank account statement like that to a guy in Wall Street will probably throw up.

921
01:11:49,000 --> 01:11:52,000
That's there it is.

922
01:11:52,000 --> 01:11:56,000
That's the game, Cryptarch.

923
01:11:56,000 --> 01:12:01,000
We give you a million dollars and you spent it all on chaingums.

924
01:12:01,000 --> 01:12:05,000
Why did we hire you in the first place?

925
01:12:05,000 --> 01:12:10,000
You're a fucking idiot.

926
01:12:10,000 --> 01:12:15,000
All right, well, I'm gonna do another run this time.

927
01:12:15,000 --> 01:12:20,000
This one will be a little bit more legit because the first couple of times I had no idea what the hell I was doing.

928
01:12:20,000 --> 01:12:25,000
And then the last few were more kind of joking around and messing around with the loadouts.

929
01:12:25,000 --> 01:12:28,000
But this is Cryptarch.

930
01:12:28,000 --> 01:12:33,000
From what I just played, this like 40 minutes session so far.

931
01:12:33,000 --> 01:12:36,000
This is really, really, really cool.

932
01:12:36,000 --> 01:12:38,000
Highly recommended so far.

933
01:12:38,000 --> 01:12:40,000
So I'm gonna pee.

934
01:12:40,000 --> 01:12:44,000
I will back in like two minutes.

935
01:12:44,000 --> 01:12:47,000
The first of many pieces by the way.

936
01:12:47,000 --> 01:12:51,000
If you didn't think there was gonna be at least like four pieces this stream.

937
01:12:51,000 --> 01:12:55,000
I just really don't know what's tight.

938
01:12:55,000 --> 01:13:00,000
I'll be right back.

939
01:13:00,000 --> 01:13:05,000
I'm gonna go pee.

940
01:13:25,000 --> 01:13:30,000
I'm gonna pee.

941
01:13:30,000 --> 01:13:35,000
I'm gonna pee.

942
01:13:35,000 --> 01:13:40,000
I'm gonna pee.

943
01:13:40,000 --> 01:13:45,000
I'm gonna pee.

944
01:13:45,000 --> 01:13:50,000
I'm gonna pee.

945
01:13:50,000 --> 01:13:55,000
I'm gonna pee.

946
01:13:55,000 --> 01:14:00,000
I'm gonna pee.

947
01:14:00,000 --> 01:14:05,000
I'm gonna pee.

948
01:14:05,000 --> 01:14:10,000
I'm gonna pee.

949
01:14:10,000 --> 01:14:15,000
I'm gonna pee.

950
01:14:15,000 --> 01:14:20,000
I'm gonna pee.

951
01:14:20,000 --> 01:14:25,000
I'm gonna pee.

952
01:14:25,000 --> 01:14:30,000
I'm gonna pee.

953
01:14:30,000 --> 01:14:35,000
I'm gonna pee.

954
01:14:35,000 --> 01:14:40,000
I'm gonna pee.

955
01:14:40,000 --> 01:14:45,000
Hello.

956
01:14:45,000 --> 01:14:50,000
I'm gonna pee.

957
01:14:50,000 --> 01:14:55,000
I'm gonna pee.

958
01:14:55,000 --> 01:15:00,000
I'm gonna pee.

959
01:15:00,000 --> 01:15:05,000
I'm gonna pee.

960
01:15:05,000 --> 01:15:09,000
Hello.

961
01:15:10,000 --> 01:15:15,000
What do I, I get a new game where can I just continue?

962
01:15:15,000 --> 01:15:19,000
No, that's from the previous one.

963
01:15:19,000 --> 01:15:23,000
That's a new game right?

964
01:15:23,000 --> 01:15:27,000
Yeah, wave one.

965
01:15:27,000 --> 01:15:28,000
Yeah, okay.

966
01:15:28,000 --> 01:15:30,000
It's a new game.

967
01:15:30,000 --> 01:15:35,000
Yeah, we should probably look at this tutorial.

968
01:15:35,000 --> 01:15:40,000
Checklist cleared.

969
01:15:40,000 --> 01:15:43,000
Pine-S-Bitch-Shyned and weapons free.

970
01:15:43,000 --> 01:15:47,000
I'll get the angle grinder out.

971
01:15:47,000 --> 01:15:52,000
Who would you get back?

972
01:15:52,000 --> 01:15:55,000
Two.

973
01:15:55,000 --> 01:15:58,000
It's a little right off the bat, I guess, that's giving me.

974
01:15:58,000 --> 01:16:01,000
Pretty good.

975
01:16:01,000 --> 01:16:10,000
Let's actually try to beat this.

976
01:16:10,000 --> 01:16:12,000
I like the way the character looks.

977
01:16:12,000 --> 01:16:15,000
Look at his face.

978
01:16:15,000 --> 01:16:16,000
Looks like a shark.

979
01:16:16,000 --> 01:16:19,000
That like shark red shark face.

980
01:16:19,000 --> 01:16:21,000
It's pretty damn cool.

981
01:16:21,000 --> 01:16:24,000
Let's conserve money.

982
01:16:24,000 --> 01:16:26,000
We'll go with the ramp spike.

983
01:16:26,000 --> 01:16:29,000
Don't need two of these at the first level.

984
01:16:29,000 --> 01:16:30,000
Might not even need one.

985
01:16:30,000 --> 01:16:33,000
I don't need the grenades.

986
01:16:33,000 --> 01:16:37,000
I can do two shields.

987
01:16:37,000 --> 01:16:48,000
Save money in the first few levels, for sure.

988
01:16:48,000 --> 01:16:50,000
I think that's pretty bare bones, that's fine.

989
01:16:50,000 --> 01:16:53,000
This shouldn't be that difficult.

990
01:16:53,000 --> 01:16:55,000
You know, save even more money.

991
01:16:55,000 --> 01:17:01,000
I think this is not two.

992
01:17:01,000 --> 01:17:05,000
I'm seeing a repair system on board this vessel.

993
01:17:05,000 --> 01:17:08,000
It's scrollings will attempt to fix other systems.

994
01:17:08,000 --> 01:17:10,000
Should we have already destroyed?

995
01:17:10,000 --> 01:17:18,000
There's a repair that goes down first.

996
01:17:18,000 --> 01:17:24,000
That has to go down first, because the alarm system and the shield generator

997
01:17:24,000 --> 01:17:28,000
will both be repaired by the time I try to come back down.

998
01:17:28,000 --> 01:17:30,000
So we have to go, I guess, right in the front.

999
01:17:30,000 --> 01:17:34,000
This is not really, this is a terrible entry point.

1000
01:17:34,000 --> 01:17:36,000
How long do I have five minutes?

1001
01:17:36,000 --> 01:17:40,000
Hold on, I have five minutes to go from here.

1002
01:17:40,000 --> 01:17:46,000
All the way down here, all the way up, and then all the way down again.

1003
01:17:46,000 --> 01:17:49,000
Might just bypass the alarm.

1004
01:17:49,000 --> 01:17:51,000
Come over here and get rid of the arm ring system.

1005
01:17:51,000 --> 01:17:58,000
This is a really tough, generated level.

1006
01:17:58,000 --> 01:18:04,000
I can come down here, and I still have to go up.

1007
01:18:04,000 --> 01:18:08,000
You know what? We'll go, yeah.

1008
01:18:08,000 --> 01:18:10,000
Let's go.

1009
01:18:10,000 --> 01:18:19,000
$54,000. That's nothing, that's peanuts.

1010
01:18:20,000 --> 01:18:21,000
Oh.

1011
01:18:21,000 --> 01:18:25,000
I'm detecting a form of energized, ablative armor protecting the drones on the ship.

1012
01:18:25,000 --> 01:18:27,000
Knock out the arm ring system in here.

1013
01:18:27,000 --> 01:18:29,000
No, no, no, no, no, knock out the arm ring system.

1014
01:18:29,000 --> 01:18:30,000
Where am I going?

1015
01:18:30,000 --> 01:18:33,000
Where am I?

1016
01:18:39,000 --> 01:18:41,000
Fuck.

1017
01:18:41,000 --> 01:18:43,000
Damn.

1018
01:18:43,000 --> 01:18:45,000
I thought it was down to the left.

1019
01:18:45,000 --> 01:18:46,000
It's right above me.

1020
01:18:46,000 --> 01:18:51,000
I just lost like a full, they're 20 seconds.

1021
01:18:51,000 --> 01:18:53,000
This isn't even the right area to go in.

1022
01:18:53,000 --> 01:18:54,000
No, I guess it is.

1023
01:18:54,000 --> 01:18:57,000
I can go either way.

1024
01:19:00,000 --> 01:19:02,000
Stinger pod.

1025
01:19:02,000 --> 01:19:03,000
Cool.

1026
01:19:09,000 --> 01:19:11,000
Brain.

1027
01:19:17,000 --> 01:19:23,000
Ticket man's having machine gun burst.

1028
01:19:23,000 --> 01:19:28,000
I didn't even see what the hell did hit me.

1029
01:19:28,000 --> 01:19:32,000
What the fuck just hit me?

1030
01:19:32,000 --> 01:19:36,000
There's like these bomb things that are floating around.

1031
01:19:46,000 --> 01:19:50,000
No, no.

1032
01:20:02,000 --> 01:20:09,000
Walk in my view.

1033
01:20:09,000 --> 01:20:15,000
Right now we're going to go destroy this shield

1034
01:20:15,000 --> 01:20:21,000
the shield here. Get back up grade. Got free minutes. I got time.

1035
01:20:28,000 --> 01:20:33,000
I gotta go down because I can't go through. Yeah, go down. Down and around.

1036
01:20:45,000 --> 01:20:55,000
What is that?

1037
01:20:58,000 --> 01:21:02,000
I've never seen this out of me. Yeah, this thing takes a ton of hits.

1038
01:21:09,000 --> 01:21:11,000
That enemy was actually pretty hard for some reason.

1039
01:21:15,000 --> 01:21:21,000
Uh.

1040
01:21:28,000 --> 01:21:34,000
Open up.

1041
01:21:37,000 --> 01:21:42,000
Open your face, please.

1042
01:21:45,000 --> 01:21:52,000
Is that another shield up here?

1043
01:21:52,000 --> 01:21:57,000
He's an I-haping enemies.

1044
01:21:57,000 --> 01:22:04,000
He's an spinning wheel of death enemy that will work.

1045
01:22:15,000 --> 01:22:21,000
Get out of here. I don't want any of this.

1046
01:22:21,000 --> 01:22:34,000
These guys are gonna sneak up on you. They blend in with the environment pretty well.

1047
01:22:34,000 --> 01:22:41,000
Brain? Time to die.

1048
01:22:41,000 --> 01:22:46,000
What the hell's going on here?

1049
01:22:46,000 --> 01:22:49,000
No, not the trick.

1050
01:22:49,000 --> 01:22:52,000
The shield isn't...

1051
01:22:52,000 --> 01:22:59,000
Yeah, that's just the alarm system, huh? I can't hurt it.

1052
01:22:59,000 --> 01:23:01,000
Huh.

1053
01:23:01,000 --> 01:23:08,000
What's going on here?

1054
01:23:08,000 --> 01:23:25,000
Huh. Does that protect this as well? I thought that was just an alarm.

1055
01:23:25,000 --> 01:23:32,000
I guess not. Well, already then.

1056
01:23:32,000 --> 01:23:40,000
I can't go around this either. This is a...

1057
01:23:40,000 --> 01:23:47,000
You can try and look. Yeah, I can't hit the glowing side.

1058
01:23:47,000 --> 01:23:48,000
I guess...

1059
01:23:48,000 --> 01:23:53,000
Okay.

1060
01:23:53,000 --> 01:23:57,000
Yeah, there was no way to go around.

1061
01:23:57,000 --> 01:24:01,000
Was that just locked in there? That side was locked in.

1062
01:24:01,000 --> 01:24:09,000
Unless I went through, that was weird.

1063
01:24:09,000 --> 01:24:14,000
Yeah, I don't think there was no way for me to go to the other side of that brain.

1064
01:24:14,000 --> 01:24:19,000
I think I may have just gotten procedurally generated screwed.

1065
01:24:19,000 --> 01:24:26,000
If I had to go all the way around, I'd have had like 30 seconds.

1066
01:24:26,000 --> 01:24:34,000
Damn it!

1067
01:24:34,000 --> 01:24:39,000
Okay.

1068
01:24:39,000 --> 01:24:44,000
You'd have to go around the whole ship. I only had like 45 seconds.

1069
01:24:44,000 --> 01:24:47,000
Whatever.

1070
01:24:47,000 --> 01:24:54,000
I could be upset or I could just get myself going.

1071
01:24:54,000 --> 01:25:03,000
Do it again.

1072
01:25:03,000 --> 01:25:08,000
Well, I'm not happy that I just blew that money.

1073
01:25:08,000 --> 01:25:13,000
I don't like this bike.

1074
01:25:13,000 --> 01:25:19,000
That one seems kind of cool, but let's look at the cluster grenades.

1075
01:25:19,000 --> 01:25:31,000
Stinger pod.

1076
01:25:31,000 --> 01:25:34,000
No, I want a bet here.

1077
01:25:34,000 --> 01:25:41,000
I don't think I need that money.

1078
01:25:41,000 --> 01:25:45,000
Let's try these for fun.

1079
01:25:45,000 --> 01:25:47,000
Stinger misses.

1080
01:25:47,000 --> 01:25:55,000
Not that many.

1081
01:25:55,000 --> 01:26:02,000
This is new.

1082
01:26:02,000 --> 01:26:10,000
That seems pretty damn cool. You can teleport to it.

1083
01:26:10,000 --> 01:26:15,000
I like that. I kind of want to try it.

1084
01:26:15,000 --> 01:26:22,000
Ah, let's take a look.

1085
01:26:22,000 --> 01:26:33,000
So there are two places to go to the brain.

1086
01:26:33,000 --> 01:26:38,000
If I go in this way, I can destroy this shield here.

1087
01:26:38,000 --> 01:26:43,000
I don't think there's a reason to destroy the door lock.

1088
01:26:43,000 --> 01:26:46,000
I don't really need a careful deal arm here.

1089
01:26:46,000 --> 01:26:48,000
Just bang.

1090
01:26:48,000 --> 01:26:51,000
Around here.

1091
01:26:51,000 --> 01:26:54,000
There is a repair station there.

1092
01:26:54,000 --> 01:26:58,000
I'm going to come up, get rid of that.

1093
01:26:58,000 --> 01:27:05,000
If I can destroy this and then come around quickly enough to destroy this,

1094
01:27:05,000 --> 01:27:14,000
it's risky, but I'm thinking I might try it.

1095
01:27:14,000 --> 01:27:16,000
I'm going to try that.

1096
01:27:16,000 --> 01:27:20,000
I should be able to go from here to there and less than a couple of minute or two, right?

1097
01:27:20,000 --> 01:27:22,000
Worst comes to worst.

1098
01:27:22,000 --> 01:27:24,000
I just have to go back around.

1099
01:27:24,000 --> 01:27:27,000
I'm going to go straight down to the top.

1100
01:27:27,000 --> 01:27:30,000
Let's go.

1101
01:27:30,000 --> 01:27:32,000
I got to go from here.

1102
01:27:32,000 --> 01:27:35,000
That's actually a pretty long way to go.

1103
01:27:35,000 --> 01:27:43,000
I'm going to go all the way around the ship.

1104
01:27:43,000 --> 01:27:54,000
Move.

1105
01:27:54,000 --> 01:27:56,000
The teleport can go down.

1106
01:27:56,000 --> 01:28:05,000
I'm going to put the teleporter right up here.

1107
01:28:05,000 --> 01:28:07,000
Is it set?

1108
01:28:07,000 --> 01:28:09,000
Oh god.

1109
01:28:09,000 --> 01:28:14,000
Okay, so you just hit two and then you hit two again.

1110
01:28:14,000 --> 01:28:18,000
Back to the original plan.

1111
01:28:18,000 --> 01:28:22,000
Oh my god, what a fucking disaster this one is.

1112
01:28:22,000 --> 01:28:31,000
This one is a total fucking disaster because I was too busy figuring out how the teleporter worked.

1113
01:28:31,000 --> 01:28:44,000
I thought it was going to shoot out of the device.

1114
01:28:44,000 --> 01:28:49,000
No, I guess it's just like remembers where you are at the time.

1115
01:28:49,000 --> 01:28:54,000
What the fuck?

1116
01:28:54,000 --> 01:29:02,000
I can do this in time for sure.

1117
01:29:14,000 --> 01:29:19,000
This is a kind of cool, but they're slow.

1118
01:29:19,000 --> 01:29:39,000
16,000.

1119
01:29:39,000 --> 01:29:50,000
I wish I had the teleport now.

1120
01:29:50,000 --> 01:30:03,000
Really wish I had the teleport.

1121
01:30:03,000 --> 01:30:10,000
Damn.

1122
01:30:10,000 --> 01:30:20,000
Run an ammo.

1123
01:30:20,000 --> 01:30:27,000
Yeah, run a bit.

1124
01:30:27,000 --> 01:30:34,000
Run a bit.

1125
01:30:34,000 --> 01:30:41,000
Run a bit.

1126
01:30:41,000 --> 01:30:48,000
Run a bit.

1127
01:30:48,000 --> 01:30:53,000
Running out of ammo.

1128
01:30:53,000 --> 01:31:02,000
Oh my goodness, I'm getting knocked all over the place.

1129
01:31:02,000 --> 01:31:10,000
Oh, that could have been a walk later.

1130
01:31:10,000 --> 01:31:19,000
I'm so upset right now.

1131
01:31:19,000 --> 01:31:26,000
I wonder how much money I'm not going to get for getting actually.

1132
01:31:26,000 --> 01:31:36,000
Well, no, I took the help, which I absolutely needed to do otherwise I would have lost.

1133
01:31:36,000 --> 01:31:40,000
Loadout max 100k.

1134
01:31:40,000 --> 01:31:46,000
Does that mean that I spent more than $100,000 to be able to do that mission?

1135
01:31:46,000 --> 01:31:50,000
Apparently.

1136
01:31:50,000 --> 01:31:53,000
Is there a story in this game?

1137
01:31:53,000 --> 01:31:56,000
I think it's pretty open-ended.

1138
01:31:56,000 --> 01:32:03,000
You're like a crew that's doing these salvaging missions for this weird snake person company.

1139
01:32:03,000 --> 01:32:06,000
I don't know all the lore.

1140
01:32:06,000 --> 01:32:10,000
This game is early access.

1141
01:32:10,000 --> 01:32:17,000
This is a very, very complete feeling game for it being early access.

1142
01:32:17,000 --> 01:32:24,000
Do I just play, I might just play it safe here and do one of the ones.

1143
01:32:24,000 --> 01:32:29,000
I need to do something simple to not, because that first one really does.

1144
01:32:29,000 --> 01:32:33,000
It's got screwed.

1145
01:32:33,000 --> 01:32:35,000
I'll do the two.

1146
01:32:35,000 --> 01:32:36,000
Tech advances six.

1147
01:32:36,000 --> 01:32:37,000
One, tail station.

1148
01:32:37,000 --> 01:32:38,000
That's just two, two.

1149
01:32:39,000 --> 01:32:43,000
I want to try to get to the end.

1150
01:32:43,000 --> 01:32:45,000
One is too easy.

1151
01:32:45,000 --> 01:32:53,000
Two is like, okay, three is like a little bit more difficult.

1152
01:32:53,000 --> 01:32:57,000
Small too, that's good.

1153
01:32:57,000 --> 01:33:01,000
Larm down there.

1154
01:33:01,000 --> 01:33:05,000
No supply pods in the loadout needs to be more than 60k.

1155
01:33:05,000 --> 01:33:08,000
I could probably get all three.

1156
01:33:08,000 --> 01:33:11,000
I'm going to go for all three bonuses, which shouldn't be that hard.

1157
01:33:11,000 --> 01:33:14,000
Considering I can just walk right in the store.

1158
01:33:14,000 --> 01:33:16,000
Two tech pods.

1159
01:33:16,000 --> 01:33:18,000
There's the shield.

1160
01:33:18,000 --> 01:33:21,000
Going with a key, destroy the brain.

1161
01:33:21,000 --> 01:33:26,000
Pretty self-explanatory, Terry.

1162
01:33:26,000 --> 01:33:28,000
So bang, bang.

1163
01:33:28,000 --> 01:33:31,000
There's a key right, oh yeah, this is this is this is Kate.

1164
01:33:31,000 --> 01:33:34,000
I just need to spend 60 grand.

1165
01:33:34,000 --> 01:33:36,000
How much is the loadout worth right now?

1166
01:33:36,000 --> 01:33:38,000
79.

1167
01:33:38,000 --> 01:33:39,000
I get rid of these.

1168
01:33:39,000 --> 01:33:41,000
That wasn't a fan of those.

1169
01:33:46,000 --> 01:33:48,000
Hmm.

1170
01:33:48,000 --> 01:33:52,000
I don't need this.

1171
01:33:52,000 --> 01:33:55,000
60k, right?

1172
01:33:55,000 --> 01:34:02,000
I think that's good to go.

1173
01:34:02,000 --> 01:34:09,000
Oh, the max, okay, I get it, I get it.

1174
01:34:09,000 --> 01:34:19,000
So I'm just going to go with nothing at all.

1175
01:34:19,000 --> 01:34:23,000
Maybe a little bit more ammo with the zip gun.

1176
01:34:23,000 --> 01:34:26,000
That'll do it.

1177
01:34:26,000 --> 01:34:28,000
That'll do it.

1178
01:34:28,000 --> 01:34:30,000
All right guys, let's do it.

1179
01:34:30,000 --> 01:34:40,000
Should be easy.

1180
01:34:40,000 --> 01:34:50,000
Two tech upgrades right off the bat.

1181
01:34:50,000 --> 01:34:52,000
I need to have six.

1182
01:34:52,000 --> 01:34:57,000
Oh.

1183
01:34:57,000 --> 01:35:02,000
I thought that was an enemy.

1184
01:35:02,000 --> 01:35:05,000
I'm going to watch out for the alarm.

1185
01:35:05,000 --> 01:35:09,000
I thought it's going to be hard to shoot through here.

1186
01:35:09,000 --> 01:35:11,000
You know what's going to happen?

1187
01:35:11,000 --> 01:35:19,000
So I need to get close.

1188
01:35:19,000 --> 01:35:22,000
Not bad.

1189
01:35:22,000 --> 01:35:24,000
These are the worst ones.

1190
01:35:24,000 --> 01:35:48,000
I hate those ones.

1191
01:35:48,000 --> 01:35:54,000
I'm going to get close.

1192
01:35:54,000 --> 01:36:00,000
Oh my god, my game is lagging.

1193
01:36:00,000 --> 01:36:13,000
Okay, well that didn't really go as planned.

1194
01:36:13,000 --> 01:36:21,000
Oh, the shield's recharging together.

1195
01:36:21,000 --> 01:36:23,000
Bye bye.

1196
01:36:23,000 --> 01:36:27,000
I didn't get the first bonus, but whatever.

1197
01:36:27,000 --> 01:36:29,000
When in doubt, blame lag.

1198
01:36:29,000 --> 01:36:31,000
Well, the lag's not the right word.

1199
01:36:31,000 --> 01:36:33,000
Like hardware lag.

1200
01:36:33,000 --> 01:36:34,000
And everything.

1201
01:36:34,000 --> 01:36:38,000
You know, your computer freezes for like a second.

1202
01:36:38,000 --> 01:36:46,000
Not like internet lag.

1203
01:36:46,000 --> 01:36:48,000
Grades don't reflect like bullets.

1204
01:36:48,000 --> 01:36:52,000
The shield killer is basically, oh, okay, that's good to know.

1205
01:36:52,000 --> 01:37:01,000
I just wish I could rebind the button to be something of my mouse.

1206
01:37:01,000 --> 01:37:04,000
I got at least the two bonuses.

1207
01:37:04,000 --> 01:37:18,000
I got plenty of money now.

1208
01:37:18,000 --> 01:37:20,000
Even more stuff to worry about.

1209
01:37:20,000 --> 01:37:26,000
Great.

1210
01:37:26,000 --> 01:37:28,000
Two fives or two threes.

1211
01:37:28,000 --> 01:37:30,000
This one is the more expensive three.

1212
01:37:30,000 --> 01:37:39,000
I'm going to do that one.

1213
01:37:39,000 --> 01:37:46,000
I have a lot of money.

1214
01:37:46,000 --> 01:37:51,000
I'm going to get a little bit more health because I have more money.

1215
01:37:51,000 --> 01:37:56,000
I know that load up max 60k is a thing, but I would like to complete this game.

1216
01:37:56,000 --> 01:38:00,000
At least, you know, do a run of this game, I guess.

1217
01:38:00,000 --> 01:38:01,000
Drawing factories.

1218
01:38:01,000 --> 01:38:08,000
How many drawing factories are there?

1219
01:38:08,000 --> 01:38:11,000
Okay, this except, oh, what's this one?

1220
01:38:11,000 --> 01:38:17,000
EMP shotgun.

1221
01:38:17,000 --> 01:38:24,000
Let's try that.

1222
01:38:24,000 --> 01:38:26,000
I'll get him. It's just hard to use.

1223
01:38:26,000 --> 01:38:34,000
I just hitting f is awkward for me.

1224
01:38:34,000 --> 01:38:36,000
We got a hedge.

1225
01:38:36,000 --> 01:38:38,000
I said EMP weaponry.

1226
01:38:38,000 --> 01:38:40,000
This game will scramble us.

1227
01:38:40,000 --> 01:38:42,000
Crit is gun.

1228
01:38:42,000 --> 01:38:50,000
Good to know.

1229
01:38:50,000 --> 01:38:58,000
F. I want that to be mouse 4.

1230
01:38:58,000 --> 01:39:02,000
Now, should still be mouse 4.

1231
01:39:02,000 --> 01:39:09,000
Mouse 4.

1232
01:39:09,000 --> 01:39:13,000
Damn it.

1233
01:39:13,000 --> 01:39:15,000
That's too bad.

1234
01:39:15,000 --> 01:39:20,000
It's not f now.

1235
01:39:20,000 --> 01:39:25,000
Well.

1236
01:39:25,000 --> 01:39:27,000
Can I make it most?

1237
01:39:27,000 --> 01:39:33,000
No, I can't do mouse 5.

1238
01:39:33,000 --> 01:39:36,000
Something that's less.

1239
01:39:36,000 --> 01:39:40,000
F is really the only thing I guess.

1240
01:39:40,000 --> 01:39:45,000
Maybe shift. Yeah, actually shift is probably better.

1241
01:39:45,000 --> 01:39:47,000
Then that takes away that.

1242
01:39:47,000 --> 01:39:52,000
I'll do this as alt maybe.

1243
01:39:52,000 --> 01:39:58,000
See if that's better.

1244
01:39:58,000 --> 01:40:00,000
Yeah, that's better.

1245
01:40:00,000 --> 01:40:05,000
Not ideal, but it's better.

1246
01:40:05,000 --> 01:40:09,000
So this is an EMP shotgun, which disables electronics.

1247
01:40:09,000 --> 01:40:12,000
So assuming I can go bang, they shut down for a second.

1248
01:40:12,000 --> 01:40:15,000
Like you can just throw it.

1249
01:40:15,000 --> 01:40:19,000
Alright, let's take a look at the area.

1250
01:40:25,000 --> 01:40:30,000
Tons of these repair systems.

1251
01:40:30,000 --> 01:40:37,000
Too many of them might with someone might say.

1252
01:40:37,000 --> 01:40:40,000
I think I'm going to get rid of the alarm system this time.

1253
01:40:40,000 --> 01:40:42,000
I'm going to start with the alarm system.

1254
01:40:42,000 --> 01:40:45,000
I'm going right in here and destroy the alarm system.

1255
01:40:45,000 --> 01:40:48,000
That really does just kill you every time.

1256
01:40:48,000 --> 01:40:51,000
When you trip that, you're going to lose like 4 HP.

1257
01:40:51,000 --> 01:40:56,000
Some of the sheer amount of people that are running around.

1258
01:40:56,000 --> 01:41:01,000
I mean, you can do twin stick.

1259
01:41:01,000 --> 01:41:04,000
You're talking about mouse control.

1260
01:41:04,000 --> 01:41:06,000
There's a gamepad mode.

1261
01:41:06,000 --> 01:41:07,000
It probably works.

1262
01:41:07,000 --> 01:41:10,000
It's kind of like geometry wars.

1263
01:41:10,000 --> 01:41:12,000
Unlike the Xbox.

1264
01:41:12,000 --> 01:41:15,000
A course of action in here.

1265
01:41:15,000 --> 01:41:20,000
No, I can't do that because the repair stations.

1266
01:41:20,000 --> 01:41:23,000
Well, these are the only two repair stations.

1267
01:41:23,000 --> 01:41:25,000
One, two.

1268
01:41:25,000 --> 01:41:30,000
Get rid of those.

1269
01:41:30,000 --> 01:41:32,000
Okay, here's the plan.

1270
01:41:32,000 --> 01:41:35,000
I'm going to get rid of both of these through here.

1271
01:41:35,000 --> 01:41:38,000
I'm going to bring a key with me.

1272
01:41:38,000 --> 01:41:40,000
And then I'm going to go down here.

1273
01:41:40,000 --> 01:41:44,000
I'm going to place the teleporter right there.

1274
01:41:44,000 --> 01:41:47,000
Teleporter goes there.

1275
01:41:47,000 --> 01:41:49,000
Then we go over here.

1276
01:41:49,000 --> 01:41:51,000
Take out the alarm.

1277
01:41:51,000 --> 01:41:52,000
Teleport.

1278
01:41:52,000 --> 01:41:53,000
Take out the shield.

1279
01:41:53,000 --> 01:41:55,000
And then make our way up in a round.

1280
01:41:55,000 --> 01:41:56,000
Actually, yeah.

1281
01:41:56,000 --> 01:41:59,000
Up in a round to the core.

1282
01:41:59,000 --> 01:42:01,000
Okay, so that means I need a couple things.

1283
01:42:01,000 --> 01:42:05,000
I need a key.

1284
01:42:05,000 --> 01:42:16,000
And I need a teleporter.

1285
01:42:16,000 --> 01:42:18,000
Okay.

1286
01:42:18,000 --> 01:42:22,000
I start here, which means I have to go up around this way through here.

1287
01:42:22,000 --> 01:42:24,000
Let's give it a go.

1288
01:42:24,000 --> 01:42:26,000
How much am I going to do I have?

1289
01:42:26,000 --> 01:42:28,000
Enough.

1290
01:42:28,000 --> 01:42:38,000
That was a lot of money.

1291
01:42:38,000 --> 01:42:42,000
Yeah, I personally wouldn't be able to play this game on anything, but I'm out.

1292
01:42:42,000 --> 01:42:46,000
Although, like, a twin stick shooter is usually pretty, they're okay.

1293
01:42:46,000 --> 01:42:48,000
They're not terrible.

1294
01:42:48,000 --> 01:42:53,000
Because it's just that you're right thumbed into the same thing, right?

1295
01:42:53,000 --> 01:43:03,000
These are the ones.

1296
01:43:03,000 --> 01:43:10,000
Those are the spin guys.

1297
01:43:10,000 --> 01:43:35,000
Nothing's breaking in here.

1298
01:43:35,000 --> 01:43:40,000
Those things can't hurt.

1299
01:43:40,000 --> 01:43:53,000
I just realized that those cannot hurt you.

1300
01:43:53,000 --> 01:43:54,000
Oh, God.

1301
01:43:54,000 --> 01:44:00,000
It's being repaired by the other one, isn't it?

1302
01:44:00,000 --> 01:44:05,000
Oh, so much ammo.

1303
01:44:05,000 --> 01:44:12,000
It's been lost.

1304
01:44:12,000 --> 01:44:13,000
I know.

1305
01:44:13,000 --> 01:44:14,000
Gotta go.

1306
01:44:14,000 --> 01:44:17,000
Gotta go.

1307
01:44:17,000 --> 01:44:24,000
Okay, they're okay.

1308
01:44:24,000 --> 01:44:36,000
Let's go back around.

1309
01:44:36,000 --> 01:44:38,000
Who?

1310
01:44:38,000 --> 01:44:41,000
Fun.

1311
01:44:41,000 --> 01:44:47,000
What the fuck?

1312
01:44:47,000 --> 01:44:51,000
I need a- I need- I'm going to need an ammo station here.

1313
01:44:51,000 --> 01:44:58,000
For sure.

1314
01:44:58,000 --> 01:44:59,000
Gotta keep right.

1315
01:44:59,000 --> 01:45:10,000
I'm gonna need to go in there though.

1316
01:45:10,000 --> 01:45:12,000
All right, let's put down.

1317
01:45:12,000 --> 01:45:17,000
There's the teleporter.

1318
01:45:17,000 --> 01:45:20,000
Well, I have a second here.

1319
01:45:20,000 --> 01:45:24,000
Looking for an ammo station down here.

1320
01:45:24,000 --> 01:45:27,000
Okay, where am I right now?

1321
01:45:27,000 --> 01:45:31,000
That's far.

1322
01:45:31,000 --> 01:45:34,000
Going to the right is too far to go.

1323
01:45:34,000 --> 01:45:35,000
I'm gonna have to just do it.

1324
01:45:35,000 --> 01:45:39,000
I'm gonna have to just bite the bullet and go down.

1325
01:45:39,000 --> 01:45:41,000
To the left and down.

1326
01:45:41,000 --> 01:45:44,000
I can even take out that while I'm down there.

1327
01:45:44,000 --> 01:45:51,000
Okay, let's go.

1328
01:45:51,000 --> 01:45:58,000
I don't have to attack anybody.

1329
01:45:58,000 --> 01:46:02,000
I won't.

1330
01:46:02,000 --> 01:46:06,000
Fucking hate those enemies.

1331
01:46:06,000 --> 01:46:09,000
These guys have put up the shield.

1332
01:46:09,000 --> 01:46:10,000
The thing is that they repaired you.

1333
01:46:10,000 --> 01:46:11,000
Holy dog shit.

1334
01:46:11,000 --> 01:46:18,000
There's so many things flying around the goddamn screen.

1335
01:46:18,000 --> 01:46:25,000
Ugh.

1336
01:46:25,000 --> 01:46:39,000
What the?

1337
01:46:39,000 --> 01:46:42,000
Quick left for dead.

1338
01:46:42,000 --> 01:46:43,000
Come on.

1339
01:46:43,000 --> 01:46:45,000
Come on left for dead.

1340
01:46:45,000 --> 01:46:46,000
Bring me back.

1341
01:46:46,000 --> 01:46:49,000
Bring me back.

1342
01:46:49,000 --> 01:46:53,000
I'm back.

1343
01:46:53,000 --> 01:46:56,000
Quickly, quickly, quickly.

1344
01:46:56,000 --> 01:46:57,000
Yes, I will.

1345
01:46:57,000 --> 01:46:58,000
That was a lot of money.

1346
01:46:58,000 --> 01:47:07,000
That was a huge amount of money.

1347
01:47:07,000 --> 01:47:19,000
That on the time for this.

1348
01:47:19,000 --> 01:47:21,000
Loading through so much money.

1349
01:47:21,000 --> 01:47:26,000
It's crazy.

1350
01:47:26,000 --> 01:47:28,000
What?

1351
01:47:28,000 --> 01:47:30,000
You fucker.

1352
01:47:30,000 --> 01:47:31,000
That's that game.

1353
01:47:31,000 --> 01:47:34,000
We're gonna go teleport.

1354
01:47:34,000 --> 01:47:36,000
See you later.

1355
01:47:36,000 --> 01:47:37,000
I triggered the alarm, but guess what?

1356
01:47:37,000 --> 01:47:40,000
It didn't even matter.

1357
01:47:40,000 --> 01:47:45,000
What the hell is shooting me from across the map?

1358
01:47:45,000 --> 01:47:48,000
Should've got grenades.

1359
01:47:48,000 --> 01:48:09,000
Should've got grenades.

1360
01:48:09,000 --> 01:48:15,000
No, that's not the right way.

1361
01:48:15,000 --> 01:48:17,000
60 seconds.

1362
01:48:17,000 --> 01:48:18,000
60 seconds.

1363
01:48:18,000 --> 01:48:21,000
Franchise fingers.

1364
01:48:21,000 --> 01:48:25,000
Oh, I don't think so.

1365
01:48:25,000 --> 01:48:27,000
I don't think it's gonna add...

1366
01:48:27,000 --> 01:48:34,000
It's gonna be a fucking Christmas miracle if I can do this.

1367
01:48:34,000 --> 01:48:36,000
I did so many people.

1368
01:48:36,000 --> 01:48:40,000
Oh my god, I have to kite them this way.

1369
01:48:45,000 --> 01:48:47,000
Jesus!

1370
01:48:47,000 --> 01:48:49,000
No way, no way, game over.

1371
01:48:49,000 --> 01:48:52,000
I can't, I'm not gonna left for dead my way out of this one.

1372
01:48:52,000 --> 01:49:00,000
No way, holy shit.

1373
01:49:00,000 --> 01:49:09,000
Fuck.

1374
01:49:09,000 --> 01:49:20,000
The EMP was the shotgun that I had.

1375
01:49:20,000 --> 01:49:25,000
It's okay, I still got money.

1376
01:49:25,000 --> 01:49:30,000
I still got cash.

1377
01:49:30,000 --> 01:49:34,000
Oh my god, it's because I bound it to shift.

1378
01:49:34,000 --> 01:49:36,000
That was, oh my god.

1379
01:49:36,000 --> 01:49:39,000
You see, if I could just put my fucking keybinding on the thing I wanted,

1380
01:49:39,000 --> 01:49:43,000
I wouldn't have forgotten that I had bombs because I pressed F.

1381
01:49:43,000 --> 01:49:44,000
And I was like, I don't have bombs.

1382
01:49:44,000 --> 01:49:45,000
Of course I don't.

1383
01:49:45,000 --> 01:49:46,000
No, it's because I had it on...

1384
01:49:46,000 --> 01:49:52,000
Fuckin' shit!

1385
01:49:52,000 --> 01:49:58,000
It should be on this button.

1386
01:49:58,000 --> 01:50:00,000
I don't think it would have mattered though, honestly.

1387
01:50:00,000 --> 01:50:05,000
I'm pretty sure I still was gonna lose that.

1388
01:50:06,000 --> 01:50:13,000
Fuck.

1389
01:50:13,000 --> 01:50:19,000
What a crocker, shit.

1390
01:50:19,000 --> 01:50:27,000
Oh, spam, spam the salty one.

1391
01:50:27,000 --> 01:50:31,000
This streamer's getting fucking salty.

1392
01:50:31,000 --> 01:50:41,000
No, it's just, I just didn't think I had them for some reason

1393
01:50:41,000 --> 01:50:45,000
because I just rebounded the key.

1394
01:50:45,000 --> 01:50:48,000
And I like forgot that the key was bound there.

1395
01:50:48,000 --> 01:50:50,000
That was the problem.

1396
01:50:50,000 --> 01:50:58,000
Won't forget this time.

1397
01:50:58,000 --> 01:51:00,000
I love a god.

1398
01:51:00,000 --> 01:51:10,000
I actually don't like this shotgun either.

1399
01:51:10,000 --> 01:51:14,000
What is this?

1400
01:51:14,000 --> 01:51:18,000
Now they're licensing us industrial equipment and standard weapons.

1401
01:51:18,000 --> 01:51:20,000
Comotive, ungrin projector.

1402
01:51:20,000 --> 01:51:23,000
Some sort of cool gun for disarboned scrap metal.

1403
01:51:23,000 --> 01:51:27,000
What does it do?

1404
01:51:28,000 --> 01:51:37,000
I don't know what it does.

1405
01:51:37,000 --> 01:51:44,000
It also cooked the grenades too.

1406
01:51:44,000 --> 01:51:50,000
We'll get as good as we're gonna have to find out.

1407
01:51:50,000 --> 01:51:56,000
Slime mortar cannons.

1408
01:51:56,000 --> 01:51:59,000
Let's close them down.

1409
01:51:59,000 --> 01:52:04,000
Let's go looking.

1410
01:52:04,000 --> 01:52:06,000
Alright.

1411
01:52:06,000 --> 01:52:15,000
I think it's time to buy more ammo for the Zip Gun.

1412
01:52:15,000 --> 01:52:22,000
Another expensive trip.

1413
01:52:22,000 --> 01:52:32,000
I'm not gonna not factory.

1414
01:52:32,000 --> 01:52:36,000
Okay.

1415
01:52:36,000 --> 01:52:39,000
Drawing factory.

1416
01:52:39,000 --> 01:52:42,000
It's another one of these spread out ones.

1417
01:52:42,000 --> 01:52:47,000
The brain is here.

1418
01:52:47,000 --> 01:52:49,000
The stream is making me dehydrated.

1419
01:52:49,000 --> 01:52:53,000
Go drink some water.

1420
01:52:53,000 --> 01:52:54,000
Go drink a gatorade.

1421
01:52:54,000 --> 01:53:00,000
Were you crazy?

1422
01:53:00,000 --> 01:53:01,000
I don't know about this one.

1423
01:53:01,000 --> 01:53:14,000
This one's really spread out.

1424
01:53:14,000 --> 01:53:17,000
I can just go in there.

1425
01:53:17,000 --> 01:53:21,000
Even if the alarm does sound, let's say I just go in here.

1426
01:53:21,000 --> 01:53:23,000
Destroy that.

1427
01:53:23,000 --> 01:53:25,000
And come right back in here.

1428
01:53:25,000 --> 01:53:28,000
Even if the alarm sounds where are they gonna come from.

1429
01:53:28,000 --> 01:53:34,000
They're gonna have to come a long way.

1430
01:53:34,000 --> 01:53:37,000
That's a very far way to go.

1431
01:53:37,000 --> 01:53:39,000
I'm gonna try that.

1432
01:53:39,000 --> 01:53:40,000
I got my Goo Gun.

1433
01:53:40,000 --> 01:53:41,000
I can try that.

1434
01:53:41,000 --> 01:53:42,000
We'll do it.

1435
01:53:42,000 --> 01:53:48,000
Up and in there.

1436
01:53:48,000 --> 01:53:50,000
I'm gonna also put a yeah.

1437
01:53:50,000 --> 01:53:52,000
Let's do this.

1438
01:53:52,000 --> 01:53:54,000
I'm going here first.

1439
01:53:54,000 --> 01:53:56,000
I'm gonna...

1440
01:53:56,000 --> 01:53:59,000
That's probably a bad idea.

1441
01:53:59,000 --> 01:54:01,000
I'm gonna say put a teleporter in here.

1442
01:54:01,000 --> 01:54:06,000
But I'm gonna trip the alarm and that'll just screw me.

1443
01:54:06,000 --> 01:54:08,000
I'm gonna get rid of the teleporter.

1444
01:54:08,000 --> 01:54:19,000
I don't want to use it.

1445
01:54:19,000 --> 01:54:20,000
Whoa.

1446
01:54:20,000 --> 01:54:24,000
Can you guys hear that?

1447
01:54:24,000 --> 01:54:25,000
Holy shit.

1448
01:54:25,000 --> 01:54:30,000
Hold on.

1449
01:54:30,000 --> 01:54:32,000
Wow.

1450
01:54:32,000 --> 01:54:36,000
Those are coyotes.

1451
01:54:36,000 --> 01:54:42,000
What the fuck is going on out here?

1452
01:54:42,000 --> 01:54:48,000
I don't know if you guys could hear that.

1453
01:54:48,000 --> 01:54:53,000
Those are coyotes, man.

1454
01:54:53,000 --> 01:54:57,000
Just looking out the window, trying to see.

1455
01:54:57,000 --> 01:54:58,000
My dog just jumped up.

1456
01:54:58,000 --> 01:55:05,000
He's like, what the hell is out there?

1457
01:55:05,000 --> 01:55:07,000
That was right.

1458
01:55:07,000 --> 01:55:08,000
I've heard them before.

1459
01:55:08,000 --> 01:55:10,000
I've heard coyotes before.

1460
01:55:10,000 --> 01:55:11,000
Down here.

1461
01:55:11,000 --> 01:55:19,000
That was right outside my window.

1462
01:55:19,000 --> 01:55:20,000
All right.

1463
01:55:20,000 --> 01:55:22,000
You got to hear the coyotes.

1464
01:55:22,000 --> 01:55:28,000
That's cool.

1465
01:55:28,000 --> 01:55:31,000
Well, if those are our coyotes, I don't know what they would be.

1466
01:55:31,000 --> 01:55:40,000
But considering there's no dogs over there, that is woods.

1467
01:55:40,000 --> 01:55:41,000
All right.

1468
01:55:41,000 --> 01:55:49,000
We'll back to reality here.

1469
01:55:49,000 --> 01:55:50,000
All right.

1470
01:55:50,000 --> 01:55:52,000
Let's go.

1471
01:55:52,000 --> 01:55:55,000
I'm gonna stick with the plan.

1472
01:55:55,000 --> 01:55:56,000
So expensive.

1473
01:55:56,000 --> 01:56:00,000
So expensive.

1474
01:56:00,000 --> 01:56:04,000
The plan is go all the way up and just go and just shoot the go everywhere.

1475
01:56:04,000 --> 01:56:05,000
It's not just stupid plan.

1476
01:56:05,000 --> 01:56:09,000
What an awful idea.

1477
01:56:09,000 --> 01:56:16,000
I wish I was better at playing difficult video games.

1478
01:56:16,000 --> 01:56:18,000
Because I kind of planned that out.

1479
01:56:18,000 --> 01:56:23,000
I'm just gonna go over there.

1480
01:56:23,000 --> 01:56:29,000
That's not a place to go.

1481
01:56:29,000 --> 01:56:34,000
What's the good thing?

1482
01:56:34,000 --> 01:56:43,000
I'm totally sure.

1483
01:56:43,000 --> 01:56:44,000
Flame thrower.

1484
01:56:44,000 --> 01:56:49,000
Now that's what I want to see.

1485
01:56:49,000 --> 01:56:51,000
Get out of here.

1486
01:56:51,000 --> 01:56:58,000
Worst enemy in game.

1487
01:56:58,000 --> 01:57:05,000
I don't think I'll meet it at the moment.

1488
01:57:05,000 --> 01:57:11,000
Wait a second.

1489
01:57:11,000 --> 01:57:16,000
Oh, shit in my pants.

1490
01:57:16,000 --> 01:57:23,000
Come on now.

1491
01:57:23,000 --> 01:57:29,000
Wonderful.

1492
01:57:29,000 --> 01:57:32,000
I don't want to use grenades.

1493
01:57:32,000 --> 01:57:35,000
What a dumb mistake that was.

1494
01:57:35,000 --> 01:57:42,000
Is there a unbelievable?

1495
01:57:42,000 --> 01:58:03,000
Oh, come.

1496
01:58:03,000 --> 01:58:08,000
Go.

1497
01:58:08,000 --> 01:58:12,000
Guys, there's like swimming out here.

1498
01:58:12,000 --> 01:58:14,000
How far away is it right there?

1499
01:58:14,000 --> 01:58:15,000
Straight up.

1500
01:58:15,000 --> 01:58:16,000
Take the heal.

1501
01:58:16,000 --> 01:58:24,000
Let's blow this thing to health.

1502
01:58:24,000 --> 01:58:31,000
Oh, that left.

1503
01:58:31,000 --> 01:58:38,000
Very quick, very quick indeed.

1504
01:58:38,000 --> 01:58:46,000
My apprentices.

1505
01:58:46,000 --> 01:58:48,000
Look at that bonus.

1506
01:58:48,000 --> 01:58:55,000
Look at that bonus for beating that in that amount of time.

1507
01:58:55,000 --> 01:59:02,000
I think we made back a couple of our awful mistakes that I made.

1508
01:59:02,000 --> 01:59:07,000
I would say so.

1509
01:59:07,000 --> 01:59:10,000
Now this is where I lost last time.

1510
01:59:10,000 --> 01:59:14,000
So for the purposes of me trying not to lose again,

1511
01:59:14,000 --> 01:59:17,000
last time I did a six and did all chain guns.

1512
01:59:17,000 --> 01:59:20,000
This time we're gonna stay with the baby three.

1513
01:59:20,000 --> 01:59:22,000
So I can try to get to the end of this game.

1514
01:59:22,000 --> 01:59:29,000
And I might not even get to the end of the game.

1515
01:59:29,000 --> 01:59:47,000
That's two expensive.

1516
01:59:47,000 --> 01:59:52,000
I think we...

1517
01:59:52,000 --> 01:59:54,000
You do like a melee only build.

1518
01:59:54,000 --> 01:59:56,000
That's pretty awesome.

1519
01:59:56,000 --> 02:00:01,000
Where's the flamethrower?

1520
02:00:01,000 --> 02:00:02,000
Flamethrower.

1521
02:00:02,000 --> 02:00:05,000
Simple but undeniably potent in tight spaces.

1522
02:00:05,000 --> 02:00:10,000
This brutish weapon sprays pressurized gouts of highly flammable liquid.

1523
02:00:10,000 --> 02:00:15,000
We're gonna need a lot more than that.

1524
02:00:15,000 --> 02:00:17,000
I would say we're gonna need that.

1525
02:00:17,000 --> 02:00:22,000
And you know I'm gonna stay tremble.

1526
02:00:22,000 --> 02:00:23,000
No.

1527
02:00:23,000 --> 02:00:26,000
I'm just lying moderate.

1528
02:00:26,000 --> 02:00:28,000
I'm just lying moderate.

1529
02:00:28,000 --> 02:00:30,000
You know, I'm not really...

1530
02:00:30,000 --> 02:00:31,000
I wasn't really feeling it.

1531
02:00:31,000 --> 02:00:33,000
So we're gonna have a backup here.

1532
02:00:33,000 --> 02:00:34,000
Back up.

1533
02:00:34,000 --> 02:00:39,000
This is the upgun.

1534
02:00:39,000 --> 02:00:40,000
Maximum 100,000.

1535
02:00:40,000 --> 02:00:42,000
What am I at right now?

1536
02:00:42,000 --> 02:00:45,000
To wait for the 100,000.

1537
02:00:45,000 --> 02:00:49,000
It's of us double 100,000 in fact.

1538
02:00:49,000 --> 02:00:57,000
Alright, we got our 200,000 dollar loadout just in case the flamethrower sucks.

1539
02:00:57,000 --> 02:01:02,000
We're gonna try it.

1540
02:01:02,000 --> 02:01:05,000
Flamethrower always seemed to be amazing or terrible.

1541
02:01:05,000 --> 02:01:06,000
That's very true.

1542
02:01:06,000 --> 02:01:11,000
Let's hope it is the former.

1543
02:01:12,000 --> 02:01:14,000
Let's take a look.

1544
02:01:14,000 --> 02:01:17,000
Damn, that's not really even a flamethrower, man.

1545
02:01:17,000 --> 02:01:19,000
That's like a...

1546
02:01:19,000 --> 02:01:21,000
Oh, I guess it is.

1547
02:01:21,000 --> 02:01:22,000
A plasma gun.

1548
02:01:22,000 --> 02:01:26,000
That's very, very dangerous.

1549
02:01:26,000 --> 02:01:28,000
One problem I see with this weapon.

1550
02:01:28,000 --> 02:01:30,000
It's very blinding.

1551
02:01:30,000 --> 02:01:35,000
It's gonna be hard for me to see incoming projectiles.

1552
02:01:35,000 --> 02:01:38,000
But we'll give it a go.

1553
02:01:42,000 --> 02:01:45,000
Another two repair.

1554
02:01:45,000 --> 02:01:48,000
Ah, this one sucks.

1555
02:01:48,000 --> 02:01:51,000
Again, we can go for speed.

1556
02:01:51,000 --> 02:01:52,000
Two repairs.

1557
02:01:52,000 --> 02:01:54,000
Wrap around right to the shield.

1558
02:01:54,000 --> 02:01:58,000
There's a couple of tech on the way.

1559
02:01:58,000 --> 02:02:00,000
How is this core surrounding?

1560
02:02:00,000 --> 02:02:02,000
Let me see this core.

1561
02:02:02,000 --> 02:02:08,000
There's one tiny little slot to get into this core room.

1562
02:02:09,000 --> 02:02:11,000
That's it.

1563
02:02:11,000 --> 02:02:16,000
It's right in the corner here.

1564
02:02:16,000 --> 02:02:19,000
That's a really awkward spot.

1565
02:02:25,000 --> 02:02:27,000
Yeah, I don't know if we'll find out.

1566
02:02:27,000 --> 02:02:29,000
Maybe we can reflect it.

1567
02:02:29,000 --> 02:02:31,000
We'll see.

1568
02:02:31,000 --> 02:02:33,000
So up here.

1569
02:02:33,000 --> 02:02:37,000
And then if I go down...

1570
02:02:37,000 --> 02:02:41,000
That's through here in there.

1571
02:02:41,000 --> 02:02:49,000
I actually might have enough time to take the alarm out and save myself a little bit of potential embarrassment.

1572
02:02:49,000 --> 02:02:51,000
We're using the flame throw.

1573
02:02:51,000 --> 02:02:52,000
I've never used it before.

1574
02:02:52,000 --> 02:02:54,000
Probably a bad idea, but it's too late.

1575
02:02:54,000 --> 02:02:56,000
I just dropped $200,000.

1576
02:02:56,000 --> 02:02:59,000
Let's go ahead and go right.

1577
02:02:59,000 --> 02:03:01,000
I have the key.

1578
02:03:01,000 --> 02:03:03,000
For this purpose, let's go right in.

1579
02:03:03,000 --> 02:03:05,000
No, I don't have the key.

1580
02:03:06,000 --> 02:03:08,000
I'd say I'm going to...

1581
02:03:08,000 --> 02:03:10,000
Yeah, we're going down.

1582
02:03:10,000 --> 02:03:14,000
We'll go down this way.

1583
02:03:14,000 --> 02:03:17,000
All right, boys and girls.

1584
02:03:20,000 --> 02:03:23,000
Flame throw or time.

1585
02:03:23,000 --> 02:03:26,000
Let's turn on flames.

1586
02:03:30,000 --> 02:03:34,000
I knew it was going to blind me, but it's very, very powerful.

1587
02:03:36,000 --> 02:03:38,000
In fact, it's so powerful.

1588
02:03:38,000 --> 02:03:41,000
It's still making the noise like I'm shooting it when I'm not.

1589
02:03:54,000 --> 02:03:56,000
Ooh, what is hitting me?

1590
02:03:56,000 --> 02:03:58,000
Fuck here.

1591
02:03:58,000 --> 02:03:59,000
God.

1592
02:03:59,000 --> 02:04:01,000
I don't like it.

1593
02:04:01,000 --> 02:04:03,000
I don't like it.

1594
02:04:03,000 --> 02:04:06,000
It's too hard to see.

1595
02:04:06,000 --> 02:04:08,000
Oh, boy.

1596
02:04:08,000 --> 02:04:09,000
That's a guy.

1597
02:04:09,000 --> 02:04:12,000
This is still doable.

1598
02:04:33,000 --> 02:04:35,000
I can't reflect.

1599
02:04:35,000 --> 02:04:37,000
Yes, it can.

1600
02:04:37,000 --> 02:04:39,000
I can't.

1601
02:04:39,000 --> 02:04:40,000
I can't.

1602
02:04:40,000 --> 02:04:42,000
Absolutely reflective.

1603
02:04:42,000 --> 02:04:43,000
Laser.

1604
02:04:43,000 --> 02:04:45,000
I like the sound of that.

1605
02:04:45,000 --> 02:04:46,000
I can't reflect.

1606
02:04:46,000 --> 02:04:47,000
I can't reflect.

1607
02:04:47,000 --> 02:04:48,000
Yes, it can.

1608
02:04:48,000 --> 02:04:50,000
I can't reflect.

1609
02:04:50,000 --> 02:04:51,000
I can't.

1610
02:04:51,000 --> 02:04:53,000
Absolutely reflective.

1611
02:04:53,000 --> 02:04:54,000
I can't reflect.

1612
02:05:00,000 --> 02:05:01,000
Laser.

1613
02:05:01,000 --> 02:05:02,000
I can't reflect.

1614
02:05:02,000 --> 02:05:03,000
It's not the noise, it's not actually a persons life.

1615
02:05:03,000 --> 02:05:04,000
It's not like that.

1616
02:05:04,000 --> 02:05:05,000
I like the sound of that.

1617
02:05:05,000 --> 02:05:07,000
Alright, go ahead.

1618
02:05:07,000 --> 02:05:08,000
Come on.

1619
02:05:08,000 --> 02:05:10,000
Right when I hit Tab.

1620
02:05:10,000 --> 02:05:11,000
How much time I got plenty of time?

1621
02:05:11,000 --> 02:05:13,000
Let's just take a slow.

1622
02:05:13,000 --> 02:05:15,000
You should go back five or six times now.

1623
02:05:15,000 --> 02:05:16,000
ú

1624
02:05:16,000 --> 02:05:17,000
bands

1625
02:05:17,000 --> 02:05:19,000
Then say I scholarship

1626
02:05:19,000 --> 02:05:21,000
and bring in maisons of robot

1627
02:05:21,000 --> 02:05:25,000
and go back 5 pelo-

1628
02:05:25,000 --> 02:05:26,000
Congratulations.

1629
02:05:26,000 --> 02:05:27,000
What are卍 amids?

1630
02:05:27,000 --> 02:05:29,000
Oh, boy.

1631
02:05:29,000 --> 02:05:30,000
You can go up 10 times,

1632
02:05:30,000 --> 02:05:34,000
So round it down?

1633
02:05:42,000 --> 02:05:45,000
Where the fuck did you come from?

1634
02:05:56,000 --> 02:05:58,000
That wasn't even so hot.

1635
02:06:00,000 --> 02:06:18,000
Oh my lord those things do so much damage.

1636
02:06:18,000 --> 02:06:23,000
They're so hard to kill.

1637
02:06:23,000 --> 02:06:26,000
Surprise I didn't get my life back.

1638
02:06:27,000 --> 02:06:29,000
All right we need to see.

1639
02:06:29,000 --> 02:06:34,000
Okay straight up, straight up, literally straight up.

1640
02:06:37,000 --> 02:06:42,000
See you later.

1641
02:06:42,000 --> 02:06:49,000
No no no no no no no no no.

1642
02:06:56,000 --> 02:07:03,000
Let's do this right.

1643
02:07:03,000 --> 02:07:10,000
Let's do it right.

1644
02:07:10,000 --> 02:07:20,000
Oh come on.

1645
02:07:20,000 --> 02:07:25,000
Come on. Really? No way.

1646
02:07:25,000 --> 02:07:31,000
Fuck. This ain't happening.

1647
02:07:31,000 --> 02:07:34,000
Damn.

1648
02:07:34,000 --> 02:07:36,000
I think I get a life here.

1649
02:07:36,000 --> 02:07:40,000
There's so many enemies here. It's a left or dead.

1650
02:07:40,000 --> 02:07:48,000
Yeah, I got it, but I immediately died. Oh god.

1651
02:07:48,000 --> 02:07:50,000
Yeah, Flametower.

1652
02:07:50,000 --> 02:07:57,000
I think Flametower kind of stuck a fork in that one, unfortunately.

1653
02:07:57,000 --> 02:07:59,000
And I had a money.

1654
02:07:59,000 --> 02:08:03,000
And now I still have a little bit of money.

1655
02:08:03,000 --> 02:08:11,000
Flametower too short and blinds you, unfortunately.

1656
02:08:11,000 --> 02:08:21,000
I'll try this one.

1657
02:08:21,000 --> 02:08:30,000
This game seems tough. It is very tough.

1658
02:08:30,000 --> 02:08:34,000
But it's very fun. It's very fun.

1659
02:08:34,000 --> 02:08:39,000
I got to try to salvage as much money as I can.

1660
02:08:39,000 --> 02:08:46,000
Well, and by salvage money, I mean the game is the game crashed.

1661
02:08:46,000 --> 02:08:51,000
No, what?

1662
02:08:51,000 --> 02:08:59,000
Yeah, I don't know how this is still audio playing.

1663
02:08:59,000 --> 02:09:02,000
I'm not sure how this is still audio playing.

1664
02:09:02,000 --> 02:09:06,000
Yeah, the game crashed.

1665
02:09:06,000 --> 02:09:10,000
That's too bad.

1666
02:09:10,000 --> 02:09:19,000
So where is it? It's not on my taskbar.

1667
02:09:19,000 --> 02:09:25,000
Sounds like it's on the menu screen.

1668
02:09:25,000 --> 02:09:31,000
Oh.

1669
02:09:31,000 --> 02:09:34,000
Cryptarch is apparently still running.

1670
02:09:34,000 --> 02:09:42,000
But where is that running? I'm not entirely sure.

1671
02:09:42,000 --> 02:09:51,000
Well, there's that. Well, we can just start it again.

1672
02:09:51,000 --> 02:10:00,000
Hold on a second.

1673
02:10:00,000 --> 02:10:03,000
I probably could salvage that too.

1674
02:10:03,000 --> 02:10:06,000
Unfortunately.

1675
02:10:06,000 --> 02:10:08,000
I'll try. I'll give it one more go.

1676
02:10:08,000 --> 02:10:10,000
I'm going to give it one more.

1677
02:10:10,000 --> 02:10:13,000
Start to finish. Try to run through it.

1678
02:10:13,000 --> 02:10:15,000
I may or may not get to the last couple of places.

1679
02:10:15,000 --> 02:10:17,000
This is a very, very hard game.

1680
02:10:17,000 --> 02:10:25,000
But that's good. That's a good thing.

1681
02:10:25,000 --> 02:10:28,000
I should do it.

1682
02:10:28,000 --> 02:10:31,000
Can I continue?

1683
02:10:31,000 --> 02:10:33,000
Wait for.

1684
02:10:33,000 --> 02:10:34,000
I think so, all right.

1685
02:10:34,000 --> 02:10:36,000
Yeah, this is the amount. This is the same.

1686
02:10:36,000 --> 02:10:38,000
No, okay, we can keep on.

1687
02:10:38,000 --> 02:10:51,000
I guess it just crashed out and saved them.

1688
02:10:51,000 --> 02:10:54,000
There was a tutorial. It was a pretty short one.

1689
02:10:54,000 --> 02:10:57,000
This is a very dark level.

1690
02:10:57,000 --> 02:11:01,000
I might have to rethink my entire strategy.

1691
02:11:01,000 --> 02:11:04,000
Going quick and trying to blow through.

1692
02:11:04,000 --> 02:11:09,000
I just get so scared of the time.

1693
02:11:09,000 --> 02:11:13,000
But I can't afford anything.

1694
02:11:13,000 --> 02:11:20,000
I have $133,000.

1695
02:11:21,000 --> 02:11:23,000
I highly recommend this though, guys.

1696
02:11:23,000 --> 02:11:28,000
Honestly, this is one of the more fun games in this category

1697
02:11:28,000 --> 02:11:32,000
that I've played since like Binding Vizek.

1698
02:11:32,000 --> 02:11:34,000
There's a lot of different loadout options.

1699
02:11:34,000 --> 02:11:42,000
There's a lot of very, very difficult things in the game.

1700
02:11:42,000 --> 02:11:47,000
But I don't understand what this is.

1701
02:11:47,000 --> 02:11:53,000
Does that mean it cuts through doors?

1702
02:11:53,000 --> 02:11:55,000
I don't know what that means.

1703
02:11:55,000 --> 02:11:57,000
See, the problem with playing through one of these games

1704
02:11:57,000 --> 02:11:59,000
for the first time and trying to figure out

1705
02:11:59,000 --> 02:12:02,000
like that last run by using a flamethrower?

1706
02:12:02,000 --> 02:12:04,000
I blew $100,000 and lost the mission.

1707
02:12:04,000 --> 02:12:07,000
I had to figure out that I didn't like it.

1708
02:12:07,000 --> 02:12:10,000
But that's why it's cool.

1709
02:12:10,000 --> 02:12:12,000
Because you're going to play with all these items

1710
02:12:12,000 --> 02:12:13,000
and all these things,

1711
02:12:13,000 --> 02:12:15,000
and you're going to lose a shitload of times.

1712
02:12:15,000 --> 02:12:17,000
You're going to find the thing that you like.

1713
02:12:17,000 --> 02:12:20,000
And you'll do all your runs like that.

1714
02:12:20,000 --> 02:12:22,000
Oh, no, what's the matter?

1715
02:12:22,000 --> 02:12:24,000
What are you doing?

1716
02:12:24,000 --> 02:12:26,000
What are you doing?

1717
02:12:26,000 --> 02:12:29,000
Just looking at me and just making like a...

1718
02:12:33,000 --> 02:12:34,000
Saw.

1719
02:12:34,000 --> 02:12:38,000
I just saw a saw.

1720
02:12:38,000 --> 02:12:41,000
Why do I feel like I'm going to make like a star comment?

1721
02:12:41,000 --> 02:12:44,000
Like, the relatable game or star?

1722
02:12:44,000 --> 02:12:46,000
I feel like if star played this game,

1723
02:12:46,000 --> 02:12:48,000
he would just do all melee.

1724
02:12:48,000 --> 02:12:50,000
And he would like beat the game in like 20 minutes

1725
02:12:50,000 --> 02:12:52,000
and be like, oh, I didn't know all melee run.

1726
02:12:52,000 --> 02:12:54,000
He'd show me.

1727
02:12:54,000 --> 02:12:57,000
And I'd be like, no, cool, whatever, dude.

1728
02:12:57,000 --> 02:13:00,000
Why does like melee, I feel like melee guy

1729
02:13:00,000 --> 02:13:03,000
is something that like star would do.

1730
02:13:03,000 --> 02:13:06,000
If you're watching right now, star.

1731
02:13:06,000 --> 02:13:08,000
Do it.

1732
02:13:08,000 --> 02:13:10,000
Let's see it, you know?

1733
02:13:10,000 --> 02:13:12,000
Let's see it.

1734
02:13:15,000 --> 02:13:19,000
I don't know, maybe I think I'm going to change up my whole...

1735
02:13:19,000 --> 02:13:21,000
my whole scheme here.

1736
02:13:32,000 --> 02:13:34,000
I can't do that.

1737
02:13:34,000 --> 02:13:37,000
I don't have enough money.

1738
02:13:40,000 --> 02:13:42,000
Well, I'm absolutely not going to beat this one

1739
02:13:42,000 --> 02:13:44,000
because I have like no money.

1740
02:13:44,000 --> 02:13:45,000
132?

1741
02:13:45,000 --> 02:13:47,000
Are the key?

1742
02:13:47,000 --> 02:13:50,000
I'm going to do the double spread shotgun.

1743
02:14:08,000 --> 02:14:09,000
Okay, let's try it.

1744
02:14:09,000 --> 02:14:12,000
Alright, I got nothing to lose really at this point.

1745
02:14:12,000 --> 02:14:15,000
Let's just see how that works.

1746
02:14:19,000 --> 02:14:21,000
That's a lot of recoil.

1747
02:14:21,000 --> 02:14:23,000
I'm like flying too far back.

1748
02:14:23,000 --> 02:14:25,000
I think that's going to screw with me.

1749
02:14:25,000 --> 02:14:27,000
To do the double spread.

1750
02:14:31,000 --> 02:14:33,000
Dangerous though.

1751
02:14:33,000 --> 02:14:36,000
I can spread him out.

1752
02:14:36,000 --> 02:14:39,000
I don't have to do it at the same time.

1753
02:14:39,000 --> 02:14:42,000
And that's probably not enough ammo.

1754
02:14:46,000 --> 02:14:48,000
I would be way more ammo than that.

1755
02:14:48,000 --> 02:14:50,000
Yeah, that's not going to work.

1756
02:14:50,000 --> 02:14:51,000
Oh.

1757
02:14:56,000 --> 02:14:57,000
Great.

1758
02:14:57,000 --> 02:14:59,000
Now I'm definitely going to lose.

1759
02:15:03,000 --> 02:15:06,000
Though I'm absolutely losing this one.

1760
02:15:06,000 --> 02:15:09,000
You guys want to see the end of this run?

1761
02:15:09,000 --> 02:15:11,000
It's going to happen right now.

1762
02:15:11,000 --> 02:15:14,000
You know what's even in there?

1763
02:15:14,000 --> 02:15:15,000
What is even in here?

1764
02:15:15,000 --> 02:15:17,000
Shield.

1765
02:15:17,000 --> 02:15:19,000
Jammer.

1766
02:15:19,000 --> 02:15:22,000
Cool, cool A-jammer.

1767
02:15:25,000 --> 02:15:27,000
Let's go.

1768
02:15:34,000 --> 02:15:36,000
Get this shit, go.

1769
02:15:36,000 --> 02:15:38,000
Where's the shield up there?

1770
02:15:38,000 --> 02:15:40,000
Go.

1771
02:15:46,000 --> 02:15:49,000
There you go.

1772
02:15:49,000 --> 02:15:52,000
I don't even care.

1773
02:15:52,000 --> 02:15:54,000
There you go.

1774
02:15:54,000 --> 02:15:56,000
I can give a shit.

1775
02:16:03,000 --> 02:16:06,000
I can't even leave the ammo.

1776
02:16:06,000 --> 02:16:09,000
I can't even leave it.

1777
02:16:09,000 --> 02:16:12,000
I can't fit down the little bot crack what the hell?

1778
02:16:34,000 --> 02:16:35,000
What?

1779
02:16:35,000 --> 02:16:37,000
No way, no way.

1780
02:16:37,000 --> 02:16:39,000
That was dog shit.

1781
02:16:39,000 --> 02:16:42,000
I got stuck in the corner over there.

1782
02:16:42,000 --> 02:16:45,000
Oh my god.

1783
02:16:45,000 --> 02:16:48,000
I can't even get out of here.

1784
02:16:48,000 --> 02:16:51,000
I can't even get out of here.

1785
02:16:51,000 --> 02:16:54,000
Oh my god.

1786
02:16:54,000 --> 02:16:57,000
I can't even get out of here.

1787
02:16:57,000 --> 02:17:00,000
Oh my god.

1788
02:17:00,000 --> 02:17:02,000
I can't even get out of here.

1789
02:17:02,000 --> 02:17:04,000
Oh my god.

1790
02:17:04,000 --> 02:17:07,000
There's nowhere to go.

1791
02:17:07,000 --> 02:17:10,000
Let's do it.

1792
02:17:10,000 --> 02:17:12,000
Move.

1793
02:17:12,000 --> 02:17:14,000
Where's the core?

1794
02:17:14,000 --> 02:17:17,000
Right down here.

1795
02:17:22,000 --> 02:17:24,000
Look at that technology.

1796
02:17:24,000 --> 02:17:27,000
I ain't even messing around right now.

1797
02:17:27,000 --> 02:17:30,000
I'm here for one purpose.

1798
02:17:30,000 --> 02:17:33,000
Where the brain?

1799
02:17:37,000 --> 02:17:39,000
Oh, get up.

1800
02:17:39,000 --> 02:17:42,000
Just die.

1801
02:17:44,000 --> 02:17:47,000
Huh?

1802
02:17:51,000 --> 02:17:54,000
I'm here.

1803
02:18:21,000 --> 02:18:24,000
I'm here.

1804
02:18:24,000 --> 02:18:27,000
I'm here.

1805
02:18:27,000 --> 02:18:30,000
I'm here.

1806
02:18:30,000 --> 02:18:33,000
I'm here.

1807
02:18:33,000 --> 02:18:36,000
You just locked me out.

1808
02:18:36,000 --> 02:18:39,000
This guy's like locking me out.

1809
02:18:39,000 --> 02:18:42,000
Get out of the way.

1810
02:18:42,000 --> 02:18:45,000
I'm here.

1811
02:19:13,000 --> 02:19:16,000
Start praying.

1812
02:19:22,000 --> 02:19:24,000
Look, blow it up.

1813
02:19:24,000 --> 02:19:27,000
Do it.

1814
02:19:27,000 --> 02:19:30,000
What did the explosion do?

1815
02:19:30,000 --> 02:19:33,000
Did the explosion kill me?

1816
02:19:33,000 --> 02:19:36,000
What's that?

1817
02:19:43,000 --> 02:19:48,000
I'm here.

1818
02:19:48,000 --> 02:19:53,000
I'm here.

1819
02:19:53,000 --> 02:19:57,000
I'm here.

1820
02:19:57,000 --> 02:20:00,000
Captain, you have exceeded the budget.

1821
02:20:00,000 --> 02:20:03,000
The banana waves killed you.

1822
02:20:03,000 --> 02:20:04,000
All right.

1823
02:20:04,000 --> 02:20:06,000
Time for a fucking dog camp.

1824
02:20:06,000 --> 02:20:07,000
That's it.

1825
02:20:07,000 --> 02:20:10,000
You know what?

1826
02:20:11,000 --> 02:20:13,000
Time for a fucking dog camp.

1827
02:20:13,000 --> 02:20:16,000
You know, when life's got you down,

1828
02:20:16,000 --> 02:20:19,000
and then you're getting your ass kicked in a video game.

1829
02:20:19,000 --> 02:20:22,000
That's, you know what?

1830
02:20:22,000 --> 02:20:27,000
It's just time for a fucking dog camp.

1831
02:20:41,000 --> 02:20:43,000
He's licking his ass.

1832
02:20:43,000 --> 02:20:46,000
Hey, hey.

1833
02:20:46,000 --> 02:20:48,000
You're on dog camp.

1834
02:20:48,000 --> 02:20:52,000
Don't you know that, buddy?

1835
02:20:55,000 --> 02:20:58,000
Hey, auto.

1836
02:20:58,000 --> 02:20:59,000
Got you.

1837
02:20:59,000 --> 02:21:03,000
You're on candid dog camp.
