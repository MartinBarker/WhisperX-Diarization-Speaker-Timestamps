1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,000
Okay, that's done on Twitter.

2
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:09,000
Oh, God, people are dying. They need my help.

3
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:15,000
I got you. Don't worry. I got you.

4
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:21,000
There's a spy up there, but I can't do anything about it.

5
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:24,000
But I can kill this sniper.

6
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:26,000
Nevermind.

7
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:36,000
All right. I got to write this on steam.

8
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:40,000
I need to go on steam.

9
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:46,000
Community. I decided first.

10
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:49,000
Groups.

11
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:52,000
Oh, I grew up of 5,000 members.

12
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:54,000
Wow. Awesome, guys. Thanks.

13
00:00:54,000 --> 00:01:01,000
5,000 steam group members. That's unbelievable.

14
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:16,000
Party.

15
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:31,000
And it's happening. Let's say in 15 minutes.

16
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:38,000
Sounds good.

17
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:43,000
And I think it's gonna pop up.

18
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:47,000
Oh, we got hit.

19
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:53,000
All right. Now I can stop playing. I'm in my server right now, guys, if you're wondering.

20
00:01:53,000 --> 00:02:11,000
It's 8 o'clock at night. Are you in Australia or something? Must be pretty across the world.

21
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:18,000
I'm in my server right now.

22
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:25,000
I have to play soldier.

23
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:34,000
Oh. I think we're gonna have a special guest.

24
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:41,000
Yeah, we're gonna have, I think we might have a special guest in a second here, dudes.

25
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:47,000
No, I gotta do something real quick.

26
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:57,000
Real quick and a quick.

27
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:04,000
Let me get back to this page.

28
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:08,000
So one more test for the new guys that just showed up.

29
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:10,000
Boy, was this in your sub box?

30
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:12,000
I feel like it's not.

31
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:15,000
If it is, I'm totally wrong if it isn't.

32
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:16,000
And I screwed something up.

33
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:20,000
But I think we might have a special guest referee.

34
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:24,000
Hold on, just a minute, guys.

35
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:29,000
Hold on, just a minute.

36
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:36,000
Thanks for the 8, Doc.

37
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:47,000
Bring this over here.

38
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:52,000
And special guest.

39
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:59,000
Are we gonna have a special guest?

40
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:04,000
Oh, ladies and gentlemen, special guest is.

41
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:08,000
I'll let him introduce himself when he gets in here.

42
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:11,000
What's up, man?

43
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:13,000
Hold on, hold on.

44
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:19,000
No one can hear anything you're saying because I have to change this.

45
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:21,000
I built you up, too.

46
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:24,000
I was like, oh, here he is, the special guest.

47
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:26,000
And then nobody can hear you.

48
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:28,000
Now they can.

49
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:29,000
Hello.

50
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:31,000
It's star, ladies and gentlemen.

51
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:34,000
Oh, my God, is it the real one?

52
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:37,000
I think it might be the fake one.

53
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:40,000
He usually is.

54
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:43,000
I literally just woke up.

55
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:44,000
Got out of bed.

56
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:46,000
He's streaming.

57
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:49,000
Yeah, yeah, I just decided to do it.

58
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:52,000
I didn't do it last night, so I tell him what's up.

59
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:55,000
I have to do it every week.

60
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:57,000
That is a good goal.

61
00:04:57,000 --> 00:05:00,000
It's on your YouTube channel?

62
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:02,000
Yeah, I don't see it.

63
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:03,000
Maybe I'm just dumb.

64
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:05,000
It should be in feeds.

65
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:08,000
Oh, yeah, they like tuck it away there.

66
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:13,000
Yeah, it's not like in subscription boxes and the feed.

67
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:17,000
I'm like student people on my own team, like doing.

68
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:19,000
Can you get in here?

69
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:20,000
I will do that.

70
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:21,000
I just...

71
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:22,000
Is it possible?

72
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:23,000
Yeah, one second.

73
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:27,000
I was just like removing HUD elements and I'll fix that up.

74
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:30,000
And come in.

75
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:32,000
Somebody said, star, I just want to let you know.

76
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:35,000
You are the shit, brosif.

77
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:39,000
Oh, shit.

78
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:42,000
I did not know that about myself.

79
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:44,000
Well, you are.

80
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:46,000
Nice, nice, uh, Pyro.

81
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:47,000
Good job.

82
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:50,000
Good job, Pyro.

83
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:52,000
PyRizzle?

84
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:57,000
No.

85
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:59,000
Oh, my God, run.

86
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:00,000
There's nothing I could do there.

87
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:05,000
And now the plan is to jump.

88
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:07,000
Oh, the rocket.

89
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:11,000
You're going to use the rocket and immediately get back stabbed again.

90
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:12,000
Okay.

91
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:18,000
The control point is being corrected.

92
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:21,000
Mm.

93
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:25,000
Surfer is full.

94
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:27,000
Who the thunk?

95
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:28,000
Who the thunk?

96
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:29,000
Yeah, my reserve slot.

97
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:30,000
I'm going to have somebody in the sir.

98
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:34,000
Oh, God, this might be bad.

99
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:38,000
I might have to kick a couple people.

100
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:45,000
I'm going to ask if anyone's, because I'm not going to kick anyone to the list of willing.

101
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:46,000
Uh.

102
00:06:46,000 --> 00:07:01,000
See if I can get maybe one or two people.

103
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:06,000
Because I need two slots.

104
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:13,000
I'm bad fat.

105
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:20,000
Boom.

106
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:21,000
Boom.

107
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:22,000
All right.

108
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:23,000
Let's see.

109
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:27,000
Are you, uh, are you like auto joining?

110
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:28,000
Spamming joint game.

111
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:35,000
All right.

112
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:42,000
I'm going to get that set up.

113
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:46,000
My, uh.

114
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:49,000
There's a lot of things you need to get set up.

115
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:50,000
I know there is.

116
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:53,000
There is a lot of stuff I need to get set up.

117
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:55,000
Like removing gold rush.

118
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:56,000
But what?

119
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:57,000
Really?

120
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:58,000
You don't like gold rush?

121
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:00,000
It's alright sometimes.

122
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:01,000
I don't know.

123
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:02,000
It seems like it's come up a lot.

124
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:04,000
Every time I look at your answer, it's like, hey, let's play gold rush.

125
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:06,000
Oh, I love gold rush.

126
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:08,000
Gold rush is like my favorite map.

127
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:09,000
Okay, I didn't say anything.

128
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:11,000
I'm sorry.

129
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:18,000
No, I, I, I got a lot of things that have to happen with this server.

130
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:20,000
All right.

131
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:22,000
He's still, is it still full?

132
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:23,000
Yeah.

133
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:24,000
I'm ready.

134
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:25,000
Is it ready?

135
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:27,000
I'm about to do something right now.

136
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:28,000
It's a drastic time.

137
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:29,000
Scope of drastic measures.

138
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:31,000
Are you leaving your server?

139
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:32,000
No.

140
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:34,000
I'm going to restart it.

141
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:38,000
I don't know if that's the fairest way to do it.

142
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:41,000
I guess this is the, this is the really only way, the fair way.

143
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:42,000
No one's leaving.

144
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:44,000
Yeah, you're all getting out.

145
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:45,000
It's closed.

146
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:49,000
Uh-uh.

147
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:54,000
This is my server, but we're trying to get star in the game.

148
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:57,000
And my reserve slot isn't really set up correctly, so it doesn't work.

149
00:08:57,000 --> 00:09:00,000
So I need to restart the server.

150
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:03,000
Just to make it so everyone can, you know, get in if they need to.

151
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:09,000
Server is going to restart right now after I do this.

152
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:13,000
Let me do this.

153
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:17,000
I'm all getting to here.

154
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:18,000
That's all right.

155
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:19,000
How's your morning doing?

156
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:20,000
You see, you just woke up.

157
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:21,000
Yep.

158
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:24,000
Say that a bed.

159
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:27,000
That's the best kind of, that's the best kind of out of bed.

160
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:28,000
Yeah, just.

161
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:30,000
Uh-uh.

162
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:37,000
Oh, at least I went to the bathroom first.

163
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:40,000
It wasn't like, hey, computer.

164
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:48,000
Yeah, at least you did you, uh, did you do number one, number two, number three, or all of them?

165
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:51,000
Number one, it smelled like pork.

166
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:52,000
What?

167
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:55,000
Extra info.

168
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:57,000
You could have said all the above.

169
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:59,000
Oh, no, I had to give the extra info.

170
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:05,000
Like, brag that I ate a whole bunch of pulled pork yesterday and it's probably the greatest food ever made.

171
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:06,000
I love pulled pork.

172
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:08,000
Pull pork is incredible.

173
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:10,000
All right, so here we go.

174
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:13,000
Server is going to restart.

175
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:16,000
So, dots, bam!

176
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:19,000
Err!

177
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:22,000
It's like I'm playing Diablo 3.

178
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:27,000
It's like a Harley B if neither of us is that on.

179
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:28,000
Look at this.

180
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:31,000
The stream is like, look at, look at how stupid this is right now.

181
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:34,000
It's like, can we get into my own server?

182
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:36,000
Oh my god, I think I got into my own server.

183
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:37,000
Yes.

184
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:40,000
Oh, or a harvest event.

185
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:41,000
Did you get in?

186
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:42,000
Yes.

187
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:45,000
It is a good day to be harvest event.

188
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:49,000
It is a good day.

189
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:52,000
Well, that's one way to do it.

190
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:54,000
So now we can start the stream.

191
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:56,000
So thank you for your patience, dudes.

192
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:58,000
I appreciate it.

193
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:02,000
It only took like 75 hours to start the stream.

194
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:07,000
Only all the hours.

195
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:11,000
All the things.

196
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:13,000
You're joking.

197
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:14,000
All right.

198
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:15,000
I have to restart TF2.

199
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:18,000
Oh, do you really?

200
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:21,000
Oh, we cursed it.

201
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:22,000
Yeah, I do.

202
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:24,000
Because you boarded something bright.

203
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:27,000
My graphics card immediately crashed.

204
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:29,000
All right.

205
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:33,000
Well, you will get in here if you restart as quick as you can.

206
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:35,000
Do a quick speedrun.

207
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:36,000
Join TF2.

208
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:39,000
There still looks like 7 on 7 right now.

209
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:43,000
And if not, then I'm going to have to kick somebody.

210
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:46,000
Someone who's playing spy.

211
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:49,000
That's how you'll choose.

212
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:50,000
It's full.

213
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:51,000
Oh, no, no, I got it.

214
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:53,000
Oh, yes.

215
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:56,000
Yes.

216
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:58,000
Where'd he go?

217
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:00,000
I need to get like a custom hard, like a real custom hard.

218
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:02,000
Because right now this thing is like blocking my view.

219
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:04,000
This capture holds the control points to win the game.

220
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:06,000
It's like, I didn't know that.

221
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:09,000
I told you again.

222
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:11,000
Oh, I just, I thought that was a trade.

223
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:12,000
Sorry.

224
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:13,000
You were trying to do it again.

225
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:14,000
I'm sorry.

226
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:17,000
I thought that was a trade.

227
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:22,000
Oh, run.

228
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:25,000
No, no.

229
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:29,000
That control point was being captured.

230
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:40,000
I was just assuming the item server was perpetually down.

231
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:42,000
Yeah, it should be up.

232
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:44,000
I got my items.

233
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:47,000
Yeah, I do.

234
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:49,000
So hello, everybody.

235
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:52,000
Welcome to this early Sunday stream.

236
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:55,000
We've got special guest star here.

237
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:58,000
I am going to bottom-frag every time.

238
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:01,000
I probably will too.

239
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:04,000
All I want to is jump.

240
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:06,000
Like jump it all I can do.

241
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:11,000
Jump this way, that way.

242
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:14,000
Oh, God.

243
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:15,000
Why is it doing this?

244
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:16,000
Okay, it didn't crash.

245
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:17,000
It didn't crash.

246
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:18,000
It's all good.

247
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:19,000
Good.

248
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:22,000
Good, good, good, good.

249
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:26,000
All right, I'm getting shot at from somewhere.

250
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:28,000
Oh, I'm too crazy.

251
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:30,000
He punched me.

252
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:33,000
He actually punched me.

253
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:35,000
See, I changed my setup a little bit.

254
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:37,000
See, I'm playing obviously in a window.

255
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:41,000
And I moved the window to the right part of my screen.

256
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:45,000
So I'm just like, look, I got to get used to this.

257
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:47,000
Because I have the chat on the left and I have the window.

258
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:48,000
I know, I need two monitors.

259
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:49,000
So bad.

260
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:52,000
I can't believe I waited as long as I did the end.

261
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:54,000
Just for streaming.

262
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:56,000
That's enough reason.

263
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:59,000
I just need a...

264
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:01,000
I need a better computer.

265
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:04,000
It's the problem is my computer is just...

266
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:05,000
It's good.

267
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:08,000
It's good computer, but it's just not good enough

268
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:14,000
to do two things at the same time.

269
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:16,000
I'm gonna go scout.

270
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:19,000
We'll go scout.

271
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:20,000
What's somebody's asking the IP?

272
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:22,000
It's just in my server.

273
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:25,000
When I got smashed right there, that's not good.

274
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:27,000
It's in many centuries.

275
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:29,000
I shouldn't even mention it.

276
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:30,000
But nothing?

277
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:32,000
What am I complaining about?

278
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:34,000
Nobody heard it.

279
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:36,000
No one heard it.

280
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:44,000
Oh, get him.

281
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:46,000
I can't believe I got up and he got away.

282
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:47,000
Also another problem.

283
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:49,000
Harvest event is really dark.

284
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:52,000
So it's a guard to see anyways.

285
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:54,000
This map is...

286
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:55,000
I should play it more often.

287
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:57,000
Because I play way too much harvest, but this is like...

288
00:14:57,000 --> 00:15:00,000
It's totally different.

289
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:03,000
Yeah, it's like a whole new world.

290
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:06,000
Playing crit scout.

291
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:09,000
Yeah.

292
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:12,000
I can't even go over there.

293
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:18,000
You'll be in the rocket jumps.

294
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:21,000
Rocket job.

295
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:23,000
Oh, no, I ran into the damn ghost.

296
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:25,000
I hate this ghost.

297
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:27,000
Why is this mapping my rotation?

298
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:29,000
I don't know why.

299
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:30,000
I missed.

300
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:33,000
Actually, it's good every now and then.

301
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:35,000
Yeah.

302
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:37,000
Kind of like...

303
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:41,000
I really hate Iaduct for the fact that it has pumpkins laying everywhere.

304
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:43,000
You kill by a pumpkin, you feel like an idiot.

305
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:45,000
But Iaduct looks amazing.

306
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:47,000
Compared to the other buy-aducts.

307
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:49,000
Yeah, Iaduct is fun.

308
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:52,000
I just got killed by a pumpkin.

309
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:55,000
Crit scout.

310
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:56,000
Crit scout.

311
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:57,000
Oh, come on.

312
00:15:57,000 --> 00:15:59,000
He wasn't even there before.

313
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:02,000
That's Malaki.

314
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:04,000
Malaki.

315
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:05,000
Malaki.

316
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:08,000
Malaki.

317
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:11,000
I'm going to the straight.

318
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:13,000
Somebody's behind me, but I want to kill the soldiers.

319
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:14,000
Anyways.

320
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:16,000
No, this guy's got me.

321
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:18,000
This guy's got me.

322
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:20,000
Oh, this guy's got me.

323
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:23,000
Oh, no, I got him.

324
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:26,000
I'm not going in there.

325
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:28,000
Pumpkin.

326
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:31,000
I shouldn't have shot him from that far away.

327
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:34,000
Too bad.

328
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:37,000
Too bad.

329
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:40,000
Too bad.

330
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:43,000
Actually, I'm not doing too bad right now.

331
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:48,000
Well, I'm doing terrible because I haven't marked a garden to anyone yet.

332
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:52,000
Okay, it's off of that montage, remember.

333
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:55,000
Totally.

334
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:58,000
I got the most amazing one yesterday.

335
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:02,000
Quite literally the most amazing marking gardener has probably ever happened.

336
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:05,000
Ever.

337
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:07,000
What'd you do?

338
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:10,000
It's...

339
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:11,000
I don't know.

340
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:12,000
I don't know.

341
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:16,000
I haven't described it, but it was four rocket jumps.

342
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:17,000
I was surfing up a ramp.

343
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:20,000
So I was technically on the ground except for the ramp.

344
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:25,000
So I was technically on the ground except it doesn't count you as on the ground.

345
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:29,000
You know, is it the same type of thing when you...

346
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:33,000
You know when you air blast somebody that's on an incline and they don't go anywhere,

347
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:36,000
but technically they're still in the air.

348
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:39,000
Yeah, it's like if anything is slanted and you rocket jump past enough,

349
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:42,000
you'll slide up it and sort of launches you off.

350
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:45,000
It was the middle of sliding up something and I hit somebody.

351
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:48,000
Yeah, when I use the reserve shooter,

352
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:50,000
I'll air blast somebody that's on an incline.

353
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:52,000
They don't go anywhere, but they still get the mini-crets on them.

354
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:56,000
It's weird.

355
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:57,000
Is the server full?

356
00:17:57,000 --> 00:17:59,000
I believe it is.

357
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:00,000
I believe it is.

358
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:03,000
I have to imagine so.

359
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:05,000
This is your first stream ever.

360
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:06,000
And welcome.

361
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:10,000
Thanks for coming, man.

362
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:12,000
Oh, okay, Oss.

363
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:16,000
Absolute, okay, Oss.

364
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:18,000
I need health. I'm not going after that.

365
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:19,000
Demo, man, with that health.

366
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:22,000
What a bad idea. Why am I drinking this right here?

367
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:25,000
That was a terrible idea.

368
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:28,000
Pump good.

369
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:30,000
Yeah, grip.

370
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:32,000
How?

371
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:34,000
That is star.

372
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:37,000
Your ears are not deceiving you.

373
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:40,000
I think I just racked jumped off a pumpkin and it was...

374
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:43,000
It was glorious.

375
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:46,000
Is that like possible?

376
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:47,000
Can you actually do it?

377
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:49,000
Either that or a rocket hit me as I jumped.

378
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:50,000
I don't know.

379
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:53,000
Wow.

380
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:03,000
Oh, I was pulling out.

381
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:05,000
That was just one of those moments when my whole body just shaked.

382
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:06,000
Shaked.

383
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:07,000
Shaked.

384
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:09,000
Because I like this pulling out my melee and he shot me.

385
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:15,000
Nearly 11 p.m.

386
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:17,000
Ooniq bandit. Where are you from, man?

387
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:19,000
That's a long...

388
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:21,000
That's a huge difference.

389
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:29,000
Yeah, pumpkin.

390
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:37,000
Yes, this is being recorded and will be uploaded in a few hours whenever I finish.

391
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:40,000
14 days, you gotta wait for it.

392
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:45,000
It's two weeks for processing.

393
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:52,000
Actually, you know, the 720 streams on YouTube, they do take quite a long time process.

394
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:54,000
Really?

395
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:56,000
Melbourne, Australia.

396
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:58,000
That is across the whole world.

397
00:19:58,000 --> 00:20:00,000
Well, thanks for coming to.

398
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:02,000
It's a long ways away.

399
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:05,000
Go in.

400
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:08,000
Immaculate crits.

401
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:11,000
Haha.

402
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:14,000
Yeah.

403
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:16,000
I can't go over there.

404
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:18,000
That's certain death. Get out of here.

405
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:22,000
Oh, it's a ghost.

406
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:29,000
Now I am so dead.

407
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:32,000
Nice shot, dude.

408
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:35,000
Nice shot.

409
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:38,000
Do I have any scout tips?

410
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:41,000
Start. Do you have any scout tips?

411
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:44,000
Shoot things, I guess.

412
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:47,000
Shoot things and run.

413
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:50,000
Yeah.

414
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:55,000
I will tell you, those scout from me at least used to be one of my worst classes.

415
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:57,000
I was awful.

416
00:20:57,000 --> 00:20:59,000
I was just playing.

417
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:02,000
It's just the more you play with it, the better you're going to get.

418
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:03,000
I know.

419
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:06,000
I had like a die a lot.

420
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:11,000
I had pretty much, it was my least play class behind Pyro.

421
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:14,000
Now it's one of my most play classes.

422
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:17,000
Oh, God.

423
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:23,000
Do you need to die a lot to start realizing you're going to die a lot of scout?

424
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:26,000
No, I think we got a robot star here.

425
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:29,000
I'm sorry.

426
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:32,000
No, not anymore.

427
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:35,000
I am getting random blanks, so maybe everyone's in a while.

428
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:37,000
I'll be a robot.

429
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:38,000
That's okay.

430
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:41,000
We forgive you.

431
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:44,000
We all still love you.

432
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:46,000
I think that's spy.

433
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:48,000
No, yeah, it is.

434
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:51,000
Oh, yeah, it is.

435
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:55,000
It's smelling you getting off the elevate.

436
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:59,000
There's no elevator on this.

437
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:02,000
You was here last night, too, wasn't you?

438
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:03,000
Come on.

439
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:05,000
What's F from Fuldre?

440
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:06,000
I don't know.

441
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:09,000
Oh, come on.

442
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:10,000
I'm sorry.

443
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:14,000
Oh, home alone too.

444
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:16,000
I'm the one that's not cool and you're quoting home alone.

445
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:17,000
Never mind.

446
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:20,000
Never mind.

447
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:23,000
Did you I spoke to it? Oh, I love that movie

448
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:26,000
Babe Bob shot babe. Oh

449
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:35,000
So I went to Dunkin Donuts

450
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:39,000
Don't do it. Oh, you can oh, it's so good

451
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:43,000
You got Dunkin Donuts in New Jersey. I think I saw what the place is

452
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:51,000
Yeah, I actually a one train ride home from Boston. There's Dunkin Donuts. There's like three Dunkin Donuts in South Station

453
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:56,000
Yeah, so I bought a dozen chocolate frosted donuts for myself

454
00:22:57,000 --> 00:23:02,000
The person getting them for you just the entire time they're picking out donuts giving me this awkward look

455
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:06,000
What could you possibly be using these for?

456
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:10,000
That's a lot for one person

457
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:18,000
I need two slots you need two reserves lots

458
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:28,000
Please reply what server is it it's my server

459
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:32,000
My server

460
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:34,000
German East Coast

461
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:41,000
No, put it down. I hate when that happens when I you go too far

462
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:43,000
You like just miss with the mini-century

463
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:46,000
That's too far man

464
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:51,000
You miss with the mini-century. I don't know some some reason it happens though

465
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:57,000
Oh god, this is the ghost again, you know what I'm just gonna talk because oh when you talk you

466
00:23:57,000 --> 00:24:01,000
Just like dance it. Oh wait, that's because I have that I thought I had the um

467
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:04,000
Thought I had the

468
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:06,000
Gunslinger out but I didn't

469
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:10,000
Where is he I heard his buy

470
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:14,000
Not was a dumb thing

471
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:20,000
Someone said donuts are amazing especially crispy crispy creams. You've had a crispy cream donut

472
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:26,000
I think so now maybe oh, yeah, so good

473
00:24:27,000 --> 00:24:31,000
Crispy cream donuts are incredible. I don't know don't have names

474
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:35,000
Well, it's like it's like a company. It's like kind of like a Dunkin Donuts

475
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:38,000
Except it's crispy creams

476
00:24:39,000 --> 00:24:45,000
Pretty much a crispy cream donut is just a glaze donut and it literally melts inside of you mouth

477
00:24:45,000 --> 00:24:47,000
It is just on it's unreal

478
00:24:47,000 --> 00:24:52,000
You can't there's only like a few of them around the Northeast though unfortunate thing

479
00:24:53,000 --> 00:24:56,000
You've ever had um ice cream

480
00:24:58,000 --> 00:25:01,000
Ice cream what what's ice cream is that like something to do with like milk?

481
00:25:03,000 --> 00:25:05,000
What am I doing why am I doing this

482
00:25:07,000 --> 00:25:12,000
Am I ever gonna put a ping limit on my server to be honest?

483
00:25:13,000 --> 00:25:15,000
Probably 20

484
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:23,000
Probably not the only reason why I say that is because I haven't had one in the last like two or three weeks since the server's been online

485
00:25:23,000 --> 00:25:30,000
And hasn't really been any problems so probably not and if there ever was one it would probably be something very very high something like

486
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:33,000
Ridiculously high like 480 or something

487
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:36,000
That's pretty low. That's

488
00:25:37,000 --> 00:25:39,000
I wish I had 480 thing

489
00:25:39,000 --> 00:25:41,000
Oh

490
00:25:43,000 --> 00:25:47,000
This heavy oh my god, I ran out of books. Oh no

491
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:51,000
Oh, why did I did what I do that

492
00:25:55,000 --> 00:25:59,000
Mr. Foreman Gary the foreman Gary

493
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:05,000
Okay, it's like this is guy's name

494
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:10,000
Okay, he he told me I to say his name

495
00:26:11,000 --> 00:26:13,000
And I just did it because I felt like

496
00:26:15,000 --> 00:26:17,000
Don't worry about this thing built up baby. Let's do it baby

497
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:29,000
There was a ghost I'll name him Gary. Oh, what I didn't get it off in time. Oh, I'm so mad at myself

498
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:32,000
Let's go for a punch ready

499
00:26:35,000 --> 00:26:37,000
I

500
00:26:37,000 --> 00:26:44,000
Will go punch only engineer right now. It's gonna work because every time I stream I'm telling you dude every time I stream

501
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:49,000
I'm just going for melee only it for some reason it works. I don't know why I don't know

502
00:26:49,000 --> 00:26:51,000
I wish I did the answer

503
00:26:51,000 --> 00:26:55,000
But for instance like oh my god this guy just screwed me no

504
00:27:05,000 --> 00:27:10,000
Oh, that was a nice attempt with the ng fest only crit sqree

505
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:15,000
It's super effective that's her Pokemon I

506
00:27:19,000 --> 00:27:23,000
Hate this door glitch on our list. I want to leave a stuck somewhere

507
00:27:29,000 --> 00:27:32,000
Punch in the center I'm gonna punch the crap out of it

508
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:40,000
All right, so I'm gonna ask you this first before I

509
00:27:41,000 --> 00:27:44,000
For I answered but do you like the Vikings?

510
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:48,000
Vikings huh

511
00:27:49,000 --> 00:27:50,000
Like

512
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:54,000
Like real Vikings are we talking about fictional Vikings right now?

513
00:27:54,000 --> 00:27:59,000
I don't know that was the question. No, I actually meant to hit Jay. I hate our Jan K. I right next to you

514
00:27:59,000 --> 00:28:01,000
Well, I mean the door was okay

515
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:08,000
Yeah, I was okay. I

516
00:28:09,000 --> 00:28:11,000
I enjoy bike

517
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:16,000
But if you if you're having stream issues try to refresh the stream

518
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:20,000
You're gonna say if you're having stream issues then Vikings aren't that good

519
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:32,000
Yeah, especially if you're on 720 then a good refresh the stream will probably help you out probably

520
00:28:33,000 --> 00:28:35,000
Vikings are even worse

521
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:38,000
How does it look by the way for anyone watching?

522
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:43,000
How because this is only the second time I've ever streamed in 720. Is it will be good?

523
00:28:43,000 --> 00:28:47,000
We sound good. We look good. We smell good and your internet's fine with that

524
00:28:49,000 --> 00:28:51,000
Apparently it wasn't last night. That's for sure

525
00:28:53,000 --> 00:28:55,000
I

526
00:28:55,000 --> 00:28:57,000
Not try to stream 720 all the time

527
00:28:57,000 --> 00:29:02,000
My internet just seems that it doesn't enjoy yeah, rather layback

528
00:29:03,000 --> 00:29:09,000
I if if all goes well then that's I mean last time I did 720 it seemed to work okay

529
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:16,000
But last night I was trying to set it up because I usually stream on Saturday nights and it was just like no

530
00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:20,000
I could I could be only streaming 360 last night. I was like testing it by myself on listed

531
00:29:21,000 --> 00:29:24,000
Well private whatever and it was not happening

532
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:35,000
If you haven't stream problems after bad for you son, I got 9 and 9 problems both are stream 8 1. No

533
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:38,000
Go be

534
00:29:38,000 --> 00:29:40,000
I love your quote

535
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:46,000
Hey, look at what I tell you just punching. Oh, you're not getting away

536
00:29:47,000 --> 00:29:49,000
That was a shotgun

537
00:29:49,000 --> 00:29:51,000
No, was it not okay

538
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:57,000
Yeah, that was a I punched my fist and looked like a shotgun. Oh

539
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:02,000
My god, K off

540
00:30:09,000 --> 00:30:12,000
There's like a line of soldiers waiting to market garden me

541
00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:18,000
I'll go not wait you go

542
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:24,000

543
00:30:25,000 --> 00:30:27,000
Spide spawn

544
00:30:27,000 --> 00:30:28,000
Spide

545
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:36,000
What class is a what what what what class is star? He's a soldier. Sorry when that's by backstab me

546
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:38,000
I had like like an aneurysm or something that was weird

547
00:30:39,000 --> 00:30:41,000
Don't do that. It's not good for you

548
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:44,000
Oh

549
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:51,000
Mini-century fight. Oh, we got too many centuries and we got a spa

550
00:30:54,000 --> 00:30:56,000
I am almost there

551
00:30:56,000 --> 00:30:58,000
No, anyone kills on my market garden

552
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:03,000
81 81 nice

553
00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:08,000
Nice nice nice nice

554
00:31:09,000 --> 00:31:13,000
Somebody asked am I gonna do another scary game face cam?

555
00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:16,000
Yeah, dude that game was horrible

556
00:31:17,000 --> 00:31:21,000
Horrible in the terms of I I completely I'm with you. I'm good with scary

557
00:31:21,000 --> 00:31:25,000
Like just watching over. God, please. Why are you still going down?

558
00:31:26,000 --> 00:31:28,000
We've agreed this is a bad idea

559
00:31:29,000 --> 00:31:34,000
It's you know what it's because I started I'll give you guys I give you the back story about that video

560
00:31:35,000 --> 00:31:40,000
So I started recording and I figured because I got a bunch of people asked me to do that

561
00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:45,000
Somebody was like oh do amnesia do SCP do this or that so I just was like you know

562
00:31:45,000 --> 00:31:49,000
I'm gonna do it. I feel like doing it and I got to a point where I was gonna turn it off

563
00:31:49,000 --> 00:31:54,000
I was like you know what I'm not gonna make this video like I just do something else like I'm not gonna make this video

564
00:31:54,000 --> 00:32:00,000
Because I sat down with it and notice how the video started when I was like kind of down a tooth like I want to

565
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:02,000
19 it sort of

566
00:32:03,000 --> 00:32:08,000
Fades out. Yeah, like I I just I pretty much get oh god. I'm lagging why oh

567
00:32:08,000 --> 00:32:11,000
No, that's a door, but that's the door glitcher than you were talking about before

568
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:16,000
What's I the video starts and I'm like already down two floors?

569
00:32:16,000 --> 00:32:21,000
That's because I stopped recording and I just sitting there going I don't I can't do this

570
00:32:23,000 --> 00:32:27,000
I really I really didn't think I could do it and then halfway through when I was actually recording

571
00:32:28,000 --> 00:32:33,000
You can you can see like in my face during the video. Oh my god over time. This is a pretty ridiculous fight

572
00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:36,000
I'll get back to that screw in a second

573
00:32:36,000 --> 00:32:38,000
We lost no

574
00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:40,000
Round ends as I'm in air

575
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:43,000
Mark it's not one that's all that matters

576
00:32:44,000 --> 00:32:46,000
It's all matters

577
00:32:46,000 --> 00:32:48,000
nothing else matters

578
00:32:49,000 --> 00:32:55,000
But yeah, so I mean I I started to get to that point where I got that first spook the first like big jumping scare

579
00:32:56,000 --> 00:33:01,000
For a second I was like you know what I'm about to hit I'm not I'm gonna escape F9 and I'm not doing it

580
00:33:02,000 --> 00:33:08,000
But that's what I said like you know what I can't give up like I have I'm already like halfway done with like this thing and that is

581
00:33:08,000 --> 00:33:10,000
We'll finish it

582
00:33:10,000 --> 00:33:15,000
When that guy comes out that's oh I'm not gonna ruin it really if you ever do

583
00:33:17,000 --> 00:33:19,000
It's it is it is terrifying

584
00:33:19,000 --> 00:33:21,000
A

585
00:33:21,000 --> 00:33:24,000
Rage quits the game for you too. That's why like at the end of the video

586
00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:26,000
I look like somebody hit me in the face with a wrench after that

587
00:33:26,000 --> 00:33:30,000
I watched more videos of the game because like I wanted to figure out like how it ended or it was more

588
00:33:32,000 --> 00:33:34,000
Yeah, I freaked out cuz

589
00:33:35,000 --> 00:33:37,000
Seriously like

590
00:33:37,000 --> 00:33:41,000
What you saw at the end of that video was like a 100% genuine like my face

591
00:33:41,000 --> 00:33:47,000
I thought I didn't even know what was going on I freaked out and then I was just like wait what happened?

592
00:33:47,000 --> 00:33:51,000
Why am I did me I was genuinely the funnel

593
00:33:56,000 --> 00:33:58,000
Live stream it

594
00:33:58,000 --> 00:34:00,000
Oh

595
00:34:07,000 --> 00:34:12,000
Become known as the stair simulator guy the stair simulator you're on it

596
00:34:13,000 --> 00:34:22,000
Somebody was telling me to do containment breach and I looked up a couple things on it. Oh my god

597
00:34:23,000 --> 00:34:29,000
That just looks it looks it looks ten times worse than SCP. Oh, it's seven the regular one

598
00:34:32,000 --> 00:34:35,000
Oh nice shot. I'm gonna go

599
00:34:36,000 --> 00:34:38,000
Bye

600
00:34:38,000 --> 00:34:44,000
Like that one is like actually 3d like creatures and weird like stuff. We're not really 3d, but it's

601
00:34:45,000 --> 00:34:48,000
I was scared playing Quake 4 so

602
00:34:49,000 --> 00:34:51,000
This is the game you should not be scared playing

603
00:34:52,000 --> 00:34:54,000
Quake 4

604
00:34:55,000 --> 00:34:59,000
Yeah, there's this one room where there's like a giant beating heart and it's really dark

605
00:34:59,000 --> 00:35:04,000
And it took me like 20 minutes to get through but all you have to do is walk up some stairs and like the missions over

606
00:35:05,000 --> 00:35:08,000
I was like just crouch walking the whole time like nope nope

607
00:35:09,000 --> 00:35:11,000
Doing this

608
00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:17,000
Oh, we're gonna get up. I knew that was gonna happen. I knew that was gonna happen

609
00:35:19,000 --> 00:35:22,000
But class what play the most probably engineer

610
00:35:24,000 --> 00:35:27,000
You get actually they'll take a look you know, can I do it from here?

611
00:35:28,000 --> 00:35:34,000
Stats here you go I've actually don't think I've ever shown this I didn't a Q and a one time but these are my team fortress two

612
00:35:34,000 --> 00:35:36,000
Stats

613
00:35:36,000 --> 00:35:40,000
And the reason why spy is so high is cuz back in like 2007

614
00:35:41,000 --> 00:35:43,000
Like that's all I played

615
00:35:43,000 --> 00:35:47,000
Got a spy. I was looking at my stats here today. Now it's disappointed with not much spy I play

616
00:35:48,000 --> 00:35:55,000
Mm-hmm like 35 hours when did I do that when did I waste that much time? Yeah, I have 138 hours to do that

617
00:35:55,000 --> 00:35:58,000
That's nothing though and also this is um I

618
00:35:59,000 --> 00:36:06,000
Think my stats got reset at some point like very early on in the game. Oh, yeah, I reset mine a while. Yeah

619
00:36:09,000 --> 00:36:15,000
God there was one day where I was playing with bots and no one was playing with bots as I go I have to do this

620
00:36:19,000 --> 00:36:23,000
Just got spy spy on spy on spy

621
00:36:25,000 --> 00:36:28,000
Whoa, whoa, no, I didn't want to hit end

622
00:36:31,000 --> 00:36:35,000
All right team. What do you say we do this come on? Let's go baby

623
00:36:38,000 --> 00:36:40,000
We're all here in this together. Yeah

624
00:36:42,000 --> 00:36:44,000
Oh, I'll play spy

625
00:36:44,000 --> 00:36:46,000
spy spy

626
00:36:49,000 --> 00:36:54,000
But I want to be the cool kind of person to play spy I want to be the cool person to fly

627
00:36:54,000 --> 00:36:59,000
Oh, come on. I was trying to did I actually get away with that like I did not I didn't

628
00:37:06,000 --> 00:37:08,000
God I just keep getting people like right when they have no health

629
00:37:10,000 --> 00:37:12,000
How you do it?

630
00:37:16,000 --> 00:37:21,000
I knew I was gonna screw that up new I was gonna screw that up

631
00:37:24,000 --> 00:37:26,000
That attitude

632
00:37:29,000 --> 00:37:35,000
I did a dead space to video well technically, but I technically the grandpa has one on respawn

633
00:37:38,000 --> 00:37:41,000
It's a hole in this straw and I can't drink the rest of my iced tea

634
00:37:43,000 --> 00:37:46,000
They're supposed to be a hole in it. That's how straws work. No, I

635
00:37:47,000 --> 00:37:49,000
Aren't you so glad I'm here?

636
00:37:49,000 --> 00:37:51,000
I am I

637
00:37:51,000 --> 00:37:55,000
It's it's hold on let me fix this stupid straw

638
00:37:58,000 --> 00:38:01,000
There we go I did the I did the best thing I

639
00:38:02,000 --> 00:38:04,000
Flip the straw upside down and put it back in

640
00:38:05,000 --> 00:38:09,000
Genius, I know I am a genius already. I have no idea what we're going

641
00:38:09,000 --> 00:38:12,000
I should have just changed the map to begin with but I was too busy like not paying attention

642
00:38:12,000 --> 00:38:15,000
I hope it's gold rush hopefully it's gold rush stars favorite map

643
00:38:16,000 --> 00:38:21,000
There's like nowhere to jump I love gold rush so much

644
00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:31,000
Actually, I did see one person you can do a jump on a second point second map of gold rush from like start to finish

645
00:38:31,000 --> 00:38:35,000
All the way through with one jump I'd probably just spend the entire round trying to do that

646
00:38:37,000 --> 00:38:42,000
And if I did it our team would win just instantly. It's like getting a nuke

647
00:38:43,000 --> 00:38:45,000
That's like getting a nuke

648
00:38:47,000 --> 00:38:55,000
Somebody asked do I like yeah, I'm using the diamond back because I like it and plus it's strange too

649
00:38:55,000 --> 00:38:57,000
So gotta use it at the strange

650
00:38:58,000 --> 00:39:00,000
I think the diamond back has a bad rap

651
00:39:02,000 --> 00:39:05,000
It's okay. I mean, it's not it's

652
00:39:07,000 --> 00:39:09,000
Like 40 gunslinger and cheese it's yeah

653
00:39:10,000 --> 00:39:15,000
Well, it's part of this way right so the the ambassador and the diamond back can't do the same damage right the

654
00:39:16,000 --> 00:39:18,000
Ambassador shoots slower

655
00:39:19,000 --> 00:39:21,000
The ambassador shoots 20% slower than the diamond back

656
00:39:22,000 --> 00:39:29,000
But you get crits on the headshots. I mean you get crits on this if like you said if there are many centuries around they I would say they're both good

657
00:39:29,000 --> 00:39:33,000
A lot of people really bash on the the diamond back

658
00:39:33,000 --> 00:39:38,000
Well, the best part about the diamond back is the sound. Oh, yeah, so mean technically

659
00:39:38,000 --> 00:39:40,000
It's it's like a better it's a

660
00:39:41,000 --> 00:39:47,000
Default if you're not going for headshots. It's better than the ambassador if you can't get headshots. It's better than the ambassador for sure

661
00:39:48,000 --> 00:39:53,000
The ambassador is still though. It's it's so good. It's so good

662
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:03,000
Oh, yeah playing that guitar are you

663
00:40:04,000 --> 00:40:08,000
Why am I wearing that like Christmas item?

664
00:40:10,000 --> 00:40:12,000
I got to put my ring on and somebody gave me

665
00:40:14,000 --> 00:40:16,000
I like the Christmas heart thing on

666
00:40:18,000 --> 00:40:24,000
You're just I don't know you're hardy I'm a cold like a thing

667
00:40:28,000 --> 00:40:30,000
I totally forgot the frying pan

668
00:40:34,000 --> 00:40:36,000
frying pan is

669
00:40:37,000 --> 00:40:39,000
There's a mini century

670
00:40:41,000 --> 00:40:43,000
You're gonna take that out

671
00:40:45,000 --> 00:40:47,000
Do rank oh

672
00:40:49,000 --> 00:40:51,000
screenshot post-or-read it

673
00:40:51,000 --> 00:40:54,000
Screen shot screen. So I just screenshot. Why don't I need help am I doing?

674
00:41:00,000 --> 00:41:02,000
Hide behind the cot

675
00:41:03,000 --> 00:41:09,000
Blue open the push get over here get over here. Oh God

676
00:41:17,000 --> 00:41:19,000
All right, here we go I

677
00:41:20,000 --> 00:41:22,000
Want to kill you oh

678
00:41:26,000 --> 00:41:31,000
Oh my god, that was so I'm sorry dude. That was like a face stab in a half don't ask me how that happened

679
00:41:33,000 --> 00:41:35,000
Hmm

680
00:41:44,000 --> 00:41:48,000
I want that medical I want to kill that medic I want that medic to heal me

681
00:41:55,000 --> 00:42:02,000
Now yeah, I'm I'm disguised as you I know I know the deal. Oh, I tried to side stab and it never works because I'm too terrible with spot

682
00:42:03,000 --> 00:42:07,000
What you spent all the hours no like a body block

683
00:42:11,000 --> 00:42:13,000
It's gonna be awesome

684
00:42:16,000 --> 00:42:26,000
Get fear three fear three three being scary. I don't think so hmm. I heard it's pretty I heard it's got it's moments my roommate in college played

685
00:42:26,000 --> 00:42:31,000
He was like a big fan of fear one and two he like praised the game all the time. I just never had time to play it be honest

686
00:42:34,000 --> 00:42:37,000
Align cast I gotta I gotta talk about that I

687
00:42:38,000 --> 00:42:44,000
Will talk about that. I think I want to do it in a proper video though. Not like really in a live stream and wait. That's you

688
00:42:45,000 --> 00:42:48,000
Yeah, I just I shoot you I'm sorry

689
00:42:50,000 --> 00:42:57,000
But pretty much for the just about 400 people watching right now. I will I will give you a snake peek of what's going on?

690
00:42:59,000 --> 00:43:01,000
I'm playing an internament

691
00:43:01,000 --> 00:43:03,000
If those be the no incredible orb

00:43:07,000 --> 00:43:13,000
Tournament for this new game. That's not out yet. I don't even know if I can even say the name of the game. It's like it not even in pre alpha

694
00:43:13,000 --> 00:43:17,000
but this this next weekend

695
00:43:18,000 --> 00:43:20,000

710
00:44:19,000 --> 00:44:21,000
But yeah, maybe we'll get to go to e3

711

718
00:44:51,000 --> 00:44:54,000
Well, it doesn't matter. I just did a good rock jump. That's all that matters

719
00:44:58,000 --> 00:45:00,000

721
00:45:06,000 --> 00:45:08,000
What is that? I've been a boost I

722
00:45:09,000 --> 00:45:11,000
I pulled up the dead ringer and I

723
00:45:13,000 --> 00:45:19,000
Oh, that was I think I just had like a brain fought right there because I pulled the dead ring around when he lit me and

724
00:45:19,000 --> 00:45:24,000
And it worked and then it instantly I why did I come out of it? Do you hear the noise? It was like oh I came out of the dead ringer

725
00:45:25,000 --> 00:45:27,000
But I didn't I was still in it

726
00:45:28,000 --> 00:45:30,000

735
00:46:20,000 --> 00:46:21,000
I

736
00:46:21,000 --> 00:46:24,000
Can care less about winning like the whole thing, but I do it would be awesome to go to E3

737
00:46:25,000 --> 00:46:28,000
Because then I could make videos and stuff about going to E3 and

738
00:46:29,000 --> 00:46:31,000
It would be so much fun

739
00:46:33,000 --> 00:46:39,000
Wow, that was a wow I am sorry to every single person here that just got covered in that your body that was my fault

00:47:21,000 --> 00:47:27,000
I probably will do more morning streams well not really morning streams, but early afternoon streams on Sunday

749
00:47:28,000 --> 00:47:35,000

00:47:42,000 --> 00:47:44,000
Oh

751
00:47:47,000 --> 00:47:50,000
Every time I see somebody in the air I always think it's you and I get scared

752
00:47:53,000 --> 00:47:55,000
Every time

753
00:47:57,000 --> 00:48:00,000
Anytime you're in anyone's in the air I

754
00:48:00,000 --> 00:48:02,000
Keep thinking it's you and it freaks me out

755
00:48:09,000 --> 00:48:11,000

00:48:16,000 --> 00:48:18,000

Belly to belly you know what that's from back to back belly to belly. I think it's from where

773
00:49:40,000 --> 00:49:42,000

Well, I my I got up my cat is like scratching

777
00:49:56,000 --> 00:49:58,000
I probably have

778
00:49:58,000 --> 00:50:00,000
One of if not the most annoying cats in the world

779
00:50:03,000 --> 00:50:09,000
See he he knows my window when it's open he knows he can come over and annoy me by just going like

780
00:50:12,000 --> 00:50:15,000
Until I gum let him in and if I don't let him in he will sit there

781
00:50:15,000 --> 00:50:20,000
He probably wouldn't even eat or sleep until I let him in like through like the window

782
00:50:22,000 --> 00:50:27,000
Yeah, he kiddin and it's like you know there's another way you can go right that you can't get in my window

00:50:27,000 --> 00:50:29,000
He just knows I'll let him in

784
00:50:30,000 --> 00:50:32,000
Always leave it open

785
00:50:33,000 --> 00:50:35,000
This is what time is right now

786
00:50:36,000 --> 00:50:38,000
That's the real question

787
00:50:38,000 --> 00:50:40,000
I don't know

788
00:50:41,000 --> 00:50:47,000
Probably another round or two on TF and I think I'm gonna transition to some Diablo free

789
00:50:48,000 --> 00:50:51,000

Yeah, star does make rocket jumping look so much fun. He also makes it look really easy too, and it is absolutely not

807
00:52:14,000 --> 00:52:18,000
One of the best videos I've ever seen of team fortress two is that video where you jumped

Where you jumped across like the whole thing a high tower and man tread in some pyro it was unbelievable

810
00:52:26,000 --> 00:52:29,000
That wasn't even that good. Oh, it was the best. I don't even know

811
00:52:30,000 --> 00:52:33,000
When I finally put all these hard gardener goes together

812
00:52:33,000 --> 00:52:36,000
Well, when you finally put this box garden thing together I

813

It's probably gonna get like 700 million views. It's gonna be that good

814
00:52:44,000 --> 00:52:46,000
The bomb is nearing a checkpoint

815
00:52:49,000 --> 00:52:51,000

Some I know you're gonna win this tournament because I'm guaranteeing it's a spelling bee. That's why I don't want to talk about it

829
00:54:05,000 --> 00:54:07,000
Oh my god get at it

00:54:09,000 --> 00:54:12,000
Just on your head. Oh, it's so scary. I

Third guy, that's like another star. That's doing it

833
00:54:25,000 --> 00:54:28,000
Like heavy. I don't have any diagnoses that I could smoke

834
00:54:29,000 --> 00:54:36,000

You gotta like crouch.

00:54:42,000 --> 00:54:42,000
Grouch.

838
00:54:42,000 --> 00:54:43,000
Grouch.

839
00:54:43,000 --> 00:54:44,000
Grouch.

840
00:54:44,000 --> 00:54:45,000
You gotta be-

841
00:54:45,000 --> 00:54:47,000
You're gonna win because I think I've convinced my team not to try it all off.

842
00:54:47,000 --> 00:54:49,000
You see like the pyro walking out there.

843
00:54:49,000 --> 00:54:52,000
We're taking it easy.

844
00:54:52,000 --> 00:54:54,000
Haha.

845
00:54:54,000 --> 00:54:58,000
Uh-uh.

846
00:54:58,000 --> 00:55:03,000
Card heavy is fun.

847
00:55:03,000 --> 00:55:05,000
Yeah, okay.

848
00:55:05,000 --> 00:55:06,000
It is.

00:55:06,000 --> 00:55:07,000
Card heavy is fun.

850
00:55:07,000 --> 00:55:12,000
Oh, to jump is card heavy.

851
00:55:12,000 --> 00:55:15,000
You gotta get the new rocket launcher for the heavy.

852
00:55:15,000 --> 00:55:19,000
The best you could do is like, um, gloves of running urgently jumps.

853
00:55:19,000 --> 00:55:20,000
Here we go, ready?

854
00:55:20,000 --> 00:55:23,000
I'll show you how to rocket jump as a heavy.

855
00:55:23,000 --> 00:55:27,000
See, look at how far I just went.

856
00:55:27,000 --> 00:55:37,000
Oh no, I'm almost out of my large Dunkin' Donuts fresh brewed iced tea.

857
00:55:37,000 --> 00:55:38,000
That's not a good thing.

858
00:55:38,000 --> 00:55:39,000
Get another.

859
00:55:39,000 --> 00:55:42,000
I mean, I have to drive to Dunkin' Donuts.

860
00:55:42,000 --> 00:55:45,000
I wish I could get a Dunkin' Donuts in my house.

861
00:55:45,000 --> 00:55:46,000
Get it?

862
00:55:46,000 --> 00:55:47,000
Get a Dunkin' Donuts.

863
00:55:47,000 --> 00:55:48,000
Just buy a franchise.

864
00:55:48,000 --> 00:55:49,000
Just own it.

865
00:55:49,000 --> 00:55:53,000
Just so you can live in it.

866
00:55:53,000 --> 00:55:54,000
I would- I would.

867
00:55:54,000 --> 00:55:58,000
If I find a house, I think I'm not even really a big coffee drinker.

868
00:55:58,000 --> 00:56:00,000
I as I love iced tea.

869
00:56:00,000 --> 00:56:02,000
And their iced tea is really, really, really good.

870
00:56:02,000 --> 00:56:03,000
Oh dear god.

871
00:56:03,000 --> 00:56:04,000
Hey, awesome.

872
00:56:04,000 --> 00:56:13,000
Maybe I should shoot some things.

873
00:56:13,000 --> 00:56:15,000
I think I'm gonna shoot some things.

874
00:56:15,000 --> 00:56:16,000
Oh yeah?

875
00:56:16,000 --> 00:56:17,000
Yeah.

876
00:56:17,000 --> 00:56:24,000
I got a ghost reacon and they gave me hats.

877
00:56:24,000 --> 00:56:25,000
Ghost reacon?

878
00:56:25,000 --> 00:56:26,000
Yes.

879
00:56:26,000 --> 00:56:29,000
So now the classes I'm allowed to play in this is to rocket jumping soldier or one of

880
00:56:29,000 --> 00:56:31,000
the classes I got a hat.

881
00:56:32,000 --> 00:56:35,000
Is that game any good?

882
00:56:35,000 --> 00:56:36,000
It's not out yet.

883
00:56:36,000 --> 00:56:37,000
It's out in like a week.

884
00:56:37,000 --> 00:56:39,000
Oh, it's actually looking really good.

885
00:56:39,000 --> 00:56:42,000
Yeah, I heard it's supposed to be pretty intense.

886
00:56:42,000 --> 00:56:46,000
They're going in a different direction, aren't they?

887
00:56:46,000 --> 00:56:53,000
It's kind of funny that a ghost reacon is, I love the first one.

888
00:56:53,000 --> 00:56:57,000
And they have dumbed down the series a lot since then and usually that would like piss

889
00:56:57,000 --> 00:56:58,000
me off to no end.

890
00:56:58,000 --> 00:57:02,000
For some reason this time I'm glad ghost reacon is dumb.

891
00:57:02,000 --> 00:57:05,000
Well, it's like the one game I'm happy about that it's dumb.

892
00:57:05,000 --> 00:57:08,000
It wasn't the ghost recon series very, very strategic.

893
00:57:08,000 --> 00:57:14,000
Like you had a very hard time planning groups and this one, I mean it has all of that,

894
00:57:14,000 --> 00:57:16,000
but for the most part you know it's not going to happen.

895
00:57:16,000 --> 00:57:17,000
Right, right.

896
00:57:17,000 --> 00:57:21,000
It's kind of like TF2.

897
00:57:21,000 --> 00:57:22,000
Hmm.

898
00:57:22,000 --> 00:57:29,000
When I watch like trailer, I think I'm rising big years of war a little bit like that kind

899
00:57:29,000 --> 00:57:31,000
of, it's like third person running around.

900
00:57:31,000 --> 00:57:32,000
Yeah, it's got that third person vibe to it.

901
00:57:32,000 --> 00:57:36,000
It's definitely, it has like all the wall hugging mechanics that you guys would have.

902
00:57:36,000 --> 00:57:40,000
But I don't actually want this game since the first of it showing single player trailers

903
00:57:40,000 --> 00:57:45,000
of it, but multiplayer looks pretty fun.

904
00:57:45,000 --> 00:57:47,000
I love fun things.

905
00:57:47,000 --> 00:57:48,000
Yeah, definitely.

906
00:57:48,000 --> 00:57:52,000
I love fun stuff.

907
00:57:52,000 --> 00:57:53,000
I throw to P.P.

908
00:57:53,000 --> 00:57:57,000
Alright, we'll do...

909
00:57:57,000 --> 00:57:59,000
I cannot get on that car.

910
00:57:59,000 --> 00:58:01,000
What am I doing?

911
00:58:01,000 --> 00:58:04,000
Why did I just pull that out?

912
00:58:04,000 --> 00:58:06,000
I'm going to die.

913
00:58:06,000 --> 00:58:07,000
Why, what do I have this on for?

914
00:58:07,000 --> 00:58:08,000
Not this, it's a steal.

915
00:58:08,000 --> 00:58:12,000
I need to put those on.

916
00:58:12,000 --> 00:58:17,000
Remember, you keep running in a circle, I know.

917
00:58:17,000 --> 00:58:18,000
I know.

918
00:58:18,000 --> 00:58:21,000
That's what happens when I live stream.

919
00:58:21,000 --> 00:58:26,000
I'm like, my two centers in my brain fight for dominance.

920
00:58:26,000 --> 00:58:28,000
And I just like, lock out in circle, what happened?

921
00:58:28,000 --> 00:58:34,000
Now we get a wrangled, essentially, that is Yikes.

922
00:58:34,000 --> 00:58:37,000
I think that's a spy.

923
00:58:37,000 --> 00:58:43,000
Oh, I missed my melee swing because I was in his body.

924
00:58:43,000 --> 00:58:46,000
Where's this other guy?

925
00:58:46,000 --> 00:58:48,000
Wait, sandwich, take it.

926
00:58:48,000 --> 00:58:52,000
Yeah.

927
00:58:52,000 --> 00:58:53,000
Come this way, come this way.

928
00:58:53,000 --> 00:58:58,000
We're going to go up, we're going to go up top.

929
00:58:58,000 --> 00:58:59,000
And...

930
00:58:59,000 --> 00:59:00,000
Oh!

931
00:59:00,000 --> 00:59:04,000
Get on the car!

932
00:59:04,000 --> 00:59:05,000
Hey, oh.

933
00:59:05,000 --> 00:59:07,000
And come on, somebody touch it!

934
00:59:07,000 --> 00:59:10,000
I should have stayed behind it.

935
00:59:10,000 --> 00:59:12,000
Yeah, but you didn't.

936
00:59:12,000 --> 00:59:16,000
You know, I'm stupid.

937
00:59:17,000 --> 00:59:20,000
One more round after this, and then we'll move on to some...

938
00:59:20,000 --> 00:59:22,000
Dwia below three.

939
00:59:22,000 --> 00:59:23,000
Okay.

940
00:59:26,000 --> 00:59:27,000
Oh.

941
00:59:27,000 --> 00:59:28,000
Oh.

942
00:59:28,000 --> 00:59:30,000
Take that.

943
00:59:30,000 --> 00:59:33,000
And...

944
00:59:33,000 --> 00:59:36,000
I showed you a grade A.

945
00:59:36,000 --> 00:59:38,000
That's it, no time.

946
00:59:38,000 --> 00:59:39,000
Oh, my...

947
00:59:39,000 --> 00:59:42,000
I should have given this sandwich, my poor, medic friend.

948
00:59:42,000 --> 00:59:43,000
Let's be close, I was...

949
00:59:43,000 --> 00:59:44,000
No!

950
00:59:45,000 --> 00:59:49,000
I warned you.

951
00:59:49,000 --> 00:59:53,000
It was essentially a warning.

952
00:59:53,000 --> 00:59:55,000
New reg.

953
00:59:55,000 --> 00:59:59,000
I'm sufficient.

954
00:59:59,000 --> 01:00:00,000
Kind of lethal.

955
01:00:00,000 --> 01:00:04,000
It's getting there.

956
01:00:04,000 --> 01:00:07,000
Oh, God's by.

957
01:00:07,000 --> 01:00:10,000
A spa.

958
01:00:11,000 --> 01:00:14,000
Yes, this will be on YouTube.

959
01:00:14,000 --> 01:00:16,000
And...

960
01:00:16,000 --> 01:00:20,000
When I finish the stream, it'll probably be up there after maybe an hour to a processing.

961
01:00:20,000 --> 01:00:21,000
So...

962
01:00:21,000 --> 01:00:23,000
We assume, what time is it right now?

963
01:00:23,000 --> 01:00:26,000
It's 9.30am for me.

964
01:00:26,000 --> 01:00:28,000
Probably streamed for another couple hours or so.

965
01:00:28,000 --> 01:00:30,000
At least another hour.

966
01:00:30,000 --> 01:00:31,000
And...

967
01:00:31,000 --> 01:00:32,000
It should be up by maybe...

968
01:00:32,000 --> 01:00:33,000
New-nish, maybe?

969
01:00:33,000 --> 01:00:34,000
Yeah, so...

970
01:00:34,000 --> 01:00:37,000
Does it upload things if they're really long?

971
01:00:37,000 --> 01:00:38,000
That's what it says.

972
01:00:38,000 --> 01:00:41,000
I talked to some people and they said that apparently that's not true.

973
01:00:41,000 --> 01:00:43,000
That's not the case.

974
01:00:43,000 --> 01:00:45,000
Yeah, I guess they just lie to you.

975
01:00:45,000 --> 01:00:49,000
It's like, oh, you can't upload a automatic stream longer than two hours and then people

976
01:00:49,000 --> 01:00:50,000
do it.

977
01:00:50,000 --> 01:00:51,000
So I don't know.

978
01:00:51,000 --> 01:00:53,000
I guess they would want to discourage everyone.

979
01:00:53,000 --> 01:00:54,000
I don't know.

980
01:00:54,000 --> 01:00:55,000
Yeah.

981
01:00:55,000 --> 01:00:56,000
It's weird.

982
01:00:56,000 --> 01:00:58,000
It's very weird.

983
01:00:58,000 --> 01:01:04,000
Someone said, since when is Herb Lurga a warning?

984
01:01:04,000 --> 01:01:06,000
Herb Lurga.

985
01:01:06,000 --> 01:01:07,000
It is.

986
01:01:07,000 --> 01:01:09,000
Yeah, yeah, I could be seen as a warning.

987
01:01:09,000 --> 01:01:13,000
Well, what else do you think I'm going to do if I'm screaming at it?

988
01:01:13,000 --> 01:01:14,000
Besides...

989
01:01:14,000 --> 01:01:16,000
I'm either on the toilet or about to kill you.

990
01:01:16,000 --> 01:01:18,000
Oh man, they have too many things going on in there.

991
01:01:18,000 --> 01:01:19,000
Watch out for me.

992
01:01:19,000 --> 01:01:22,000
Yeah, you take the sandwich.

993
01:01:22,000 --> 01:01:23,000
You need it.

994
01:01:23,000 --> 01:01:24,000
Dude, eat sandwich.

995
01:01:24,000 --> 01:01:26,000
I'm going to go around.

996
01:01:26,000 --> 01:01:27,000
I'm going to go around.

997
01:01:27,000 --> 01:01:28,000
It's all about...

998
01:01:28,000 --> 01:01:29,000
They only have a mini-century, man.

999
01:01:29,000 --> 01:01:30,000
We're getting pushed back by a mini-sense.

1000
01:01:31,000 --> 01:01:33,000
It's all about...

1001
01:01:33,000 --> 01:01:35,000
They only have a mini-century, man.

1002
01:01:35,000 --> 01:01:39,000
We're getting pushed back by a mini-century and like a bunch of devil men.

1003
01:01:39,000 --> 01:01:40,000
Oh god, I'm so dead.

1004
01:01:40,000 --> 01:01:41,000
Oh god.

1005
01:01:41,000 --> 01:01:44,000
Why do I not have these out?

1006
01:01:44,000 --> 01:01:45,000
Somebody ask?

1007
01:01:45,000 --> 01:01:47,000
All right, here we go.

1008
01:01:47,000 --> 01:01:48,000
Here we go.

1009
01:01:48,000 --> 01:01:49,000
There we go.

1010
01:01:49,000 --> 01:01:50,000
Come on.

1011
01:01:50,000 --> 01:01:51,000
Come on.

1012
01:01:51,000 --> 01:01:52,000
Somebody help me.

1013
01:01:52,000 --> 01:01:53,000
Come on.

1014
01:01:53,000 --> 01:01:55,000
Somebody help me.

1015
01:02:00,000 --> 01:02:02,000
I shot you with my gun.

1016
01:02:02,000 --> 01:02:04,000
It was a bomb gun.

1017
01:02:04,000 --> 01:02:06,000
A bomb gun, is that new?

1018
01:02:06,000 --> 01:02:07,000
Yeah.

1019
01:02:07,000 --> 01:02:09,000
I hope I get it.

1020
01:02:09,000 --> 01:02:10,000
Cool.

1021
01:02:10,000 --> 01:02:11,000
I'm...

1022
01:02:11,000 --> 01:02:12,000
I'm...

1023
01:02:12,000 --> 01:02:13,000
I'm...

1024
01:02:13,000 --> 01:02:14,000
I'm...

1025
01:02:14,000 --> 01:02:15,000
I'm...

1026
01:02:15,000 --> 01:02:18,000
I'm probably not going to switch servers, but some of you guys are asking only because

1027
01:02:18,000 --> 01:02:22,000
the stars in here and I wouldn't want it to be like, oh, we both can't get into the

1028
01:02:22,000 --> 01:02:23,000
same server.

1029
01:02:23,000 --> 01:02:27,000
And plus I'm on my server, so I like playing on my server because I like playing with

1030
01:02:27,000 --> 01:02:33,000
the dudes on my server because they're cool.

1031
01:02:33,000 --> 01:02:35,000
So one more, we say.

1032
01:02:35,000 --> 01:02:36,000
Let's go to...

1033
01:02:36,000 --> 01:02:41,000
No, no, no, no.

1034
01:02:41,000 --> 01:02:43,000
Let's go to good old gold rush.

1035
01:02:43,000 --> 01:02:45,000
No, please, no.

1036
01:02:45,000 --> 01:02:48,000
All right, finally, fine.

1037
01:02:48,000 --> 01:02:56,000
Well, then I'm trying to like figure out how to like do something fun.

1038
01:02:56,000 --> 01:02:57,000
Ah!

1039
01:02:57,000 --> 01:02:58,000
Nrrrr.

1040
01:02:58,000 --> 01:02:59,000
I slapped you.

1041
01:02:59,000 --> 01:03:00,000
I got you.

1042
01:03:00,000 --> 01:03:02,000
You need to rapid fire that.

1043
01:03:02,000 --> 01:03:03,000
Oh, you can do that?

1044
01:03:03,000 --> 01:03:07,000
Yeah, if you just keep mashing the button, you can get slapped so much it like pops you

1045
01:03:07,000 --> 01:03:08,000
up in the air.

1046
01:03:08,000 --> 01:03:09,000
Hold you there.

1047
01:03:09,000 --> 01:03:11,000
All right, let's go.

1048
01:03:11,000 --> 01:03:16,000
Oh, you're going to be mad, but I kind of want to play on Turbline.

1049
01:03:16,000 --> 01:03:23,000
You know what, as long as I don't know, I just want to gel, man.

1050
01:03:23,000 --> 01:03:24,000
Turbine.

1051
01:03:24,000 --> 01:03:29,000
I guess Turbine has stairs.

1052
01:03:29,000 --> 01:03:31,000
I just love Turbine.

1053
01:03:31,000 --> 01:03:32,000
I love a lot of things, don't I?

1054
01:03:32,000 --> 01:03:34,000
Should have played 2-4.

1055
01:03:34,000 --> 01:03:35,000
2-4.

1056
01:03:35,000 --> 01:03:39,000
But Turbine's like the good 2-4, doesn't it?

1057
01:03:39,000 --> 01:03:42,000
No, the 2-4 is the best 2-4.

1058
01:03:42,000 --> 01:03:49,000
Oh, I'll stick them all night.

1059
01:03:49,000 --> 01:03:52,000
Oh, it's my spray.

1060
01:03:52,000 --> 01:03:54,000
Ah, Derma.

1061
01:03:54,000 --> 01:03:55,000
Oh.

1062
01:03:55,000 --> 01:04:00,000
This hero now hates you.

1063
01:04:00,000 --> 01:04:01,000
Gary Monster.

1064
01:04:01,000 --> 01:04:02,000
Look what you did.

1065
01:04:02,000 --> 01:04:03,000
What I do.

1066
01:04:03,000 --> 01:04:04,000
What I do.

1067
01:04:04,000 --> 01:04:10,000
What happened?

1068
01:04:10,000 --> 01:04:11,000
What I do?

1069
01:04:11,000 --> 01:04:15,000
You picked this map.

1070
01:04:15,000 --> 01:04:20,000
So there's a ceiling on this map.

1071
01:04:20,000 --> 01:04:23,000
There's nowhere that does not have a ceiling.

1072
01:04:23,000 --> 01:04:30,000
Yeah, but you could do like an off the wall kind of like move, can't you?

1073
01:04:30,000 --> 01:04:33,000
Yeah.

1074
01:04:33,000 --> 01:04:34,000
Yeah.

1075
01:04:34,000 --> 01:04:36,000
I don't know, I'll ask him.

1076
01:04:36,000 --> 01:04:38,000
Star, are you going to play Diablo 3 as well?

1077
01:04:38,000 --> 01:04:39,000
Yeah, sure.

1078
01:04:39,000 --> 01:04:40,000
Yeah, sure.

1079
01:04:40,000 --> 01:04:41,000
Yeah, sure.

1080
01:04:41,000 --> 01:04:42,000
T-Milion.

1081
01:04:42,000 --> 01:04:43,000
Okay.

1082
01:04:43,000 --> 01:04:44,000
Oh, I hear a dog.

1083
01:04:44,000 --> 01:04:51,000
I think that might be my dog.

1084
01:04:51,000 --> 01:04:57,000
My dog.

1085
01:04:57,000 --> 01:04:59,000
Oh, my God, a sentry.

1086
01:04:59,000 --> 01:05:03,000
A strategy to turbine hold mid-wind game.

1087
01:05:03,000 --> 01:05:05,000
Oh.

1088
01:05:05,000 --> 01:05:06,000
How are you still?

1089
01:05:06,000 --> 01:05:08,000
Oh, you get an overview.

1090
01:05:08,000 --> 01:05:09,000
Makes sense.

1091
01:05:09,000 --> 01:05:11,000
Oh, damn it.

1092
01:05:11,000 --> 01:05:15,000
I was trying to go for a top kill on that.

1093
01:05:15,000 --> 01:05:21,000
I'm going to walk into corner.

1094
01:05:21,000 --> 01:05:23,000
Why is this respawn so long?

1095
01:05:23,000 --> 01:05:24,000
I changed that.

1096
01:05:24,000 --> 01:05:25,000
It's respawned.

1097
01:05:25,000 --> 01:05:26,000
It's respawned.

1098
01:05:26,000 --> 01:05:29,000
I'm respawned by time, right?

1099
01:05:29,000 --> 01:05:31,000
You can't.

1100
01:05:31,000 --> 01:05:33,000
It's too turbine.

1101
01:05:33,000 --> 01:05:35,000
You could change the respawn.

1102
01:05:35,000 --> 01:05:37,000
Easy can.

1103
01:05:37,000 --> 01:05:38,000
I don't know.

1104
01:05:38,000 --> 01:05:40,000
I have my respawned wave time at two.

1105
01:05:40,000 --> 01:05:47,000
Isn't that supposed to be God, crits?

1106
01:05:47,000 --> 01:05:49,000
I thought I was going to bite my ankles in a second.

1107
01:05:49,000 --> 01:05:54,000
He's probably going to run here.

1108
01:05:54,000 --> 01:05:57,000
Oh, come on.

1109
01:05:57,000 --> 01:06:03,000
I want my crits.

1110
01:06:03,000 --> 01:06:05,000
Let grandpa play Diablo.

1111
01:06:05,000 --> 01:06:06,000
I don't think he would get it.

1112
01:06:06,000 --> 01:06:09,000
I think he'd be too confused.

1113
01:06:09,000 --> 01:06:11,000
There's too many numbers to deal with in Diablo.

1114
01:06:11,000 --> 01:06:12,000
You don't just shoot people.

1115
01:06:12,000 --> 01:06:15,000
Well, that's why they made numbers off by default.

1116
01:06:15,000 --> 01:06:17,000
And you know advanced tool tips.

1117
01:06:17,000 --> 01:06:19,000
People like him.

1118
01:06:19,000 --> 01:06:22,000
What just happened?

1119
01:06:22,000 --> 01:06:25,000
All right, so I charged with the charging charge.

1120
01:06:25,000 --> 01:06:28,000
And right when I clicked right click, I got backstabbed.

1121
01:06:28,000 --> 01:06:33,000
And my body just like baseball slid across like the whole map.

1122
01:06:33,000 --> 01:06:34,000
I love getting backstabbed.

1123
01:06:34,000 --> 01:06:36,000
It's right as you're I could jump and your body just poof.

1124
01:06:36,000 --> 01:06:39,000
It's God.

1125
01:06:39,000 --> 01:06:42,000
Boom.

1126
01:06:42,000 --> 01:06:46,000
Okay.

1127
01:06:46,000 --> 01:06:48,000
Let me say.

1128
01:06:48,000 --> 01:06:51,000
Let me find some dude to run into here.

1129
01:06:51,000 --> 01:06:54,000
Here's a mini-century.

1130
01:06:54,000 --> 01:06:55,000
Mm-hmm.

1131
01:06:55,000 --> 01:06:57,000
Help me.

1132
01:06:57,000 --> 01:07:00,000
I'm real ice-wear.

1133
01:07:00,000 --> 01:07:03,000
That's a sticky.

1134
01:07:03,000 --> 01:07:05,000
That's me getting shot.

1135
01:07:05,000 --> 01:07:06,000
Hi, right here.

1136
01:07:06,000 --> 01:07:08,000
I know a secret.

1137
01:07:08,000 --> 01:07:10,000
What?

1138
01:07:10,000 --> 01:07:12,000
And then you just what?

1139
01:07:12,000 --> 01:07:15,000
What?

1140
01:07:15,000 --> 01:07:17,000
I was going to work on my secret technique.

1141
01:07:17,000 --> 01:07:18,000
And 20 seconds.

1142
01:07:18,000 --> 01:07:20,000
Hold on a minute.

1143
01:07:21,000 --> 01:07:24,000
Oh, actually, I was about to type in the server password.

1144
01:07:24,000 --> 01:07:25,000
It's like, hold on.

1145
01:07:25,000 --> 01:07:29,000
Let me just type my arcon password right now in front of like 400 people.

1146
01:07:29,000 --> 01:07:30,000
Okay.

1147
01:07:30,000 --> 01:07:32,000
No big bad idea.

1148
01:07:35,000 --> 01:07:37,000
20, that's too long.

1149
01:07:37,000 --> 01:07:38,000
20 seconds.

1150
01:07:38,000 --> 01:07:41,000
It's supposed to be like nine.

1151
01:07:47,000 --> 01:07:48,000
Come on.

1152
01:07:48,000 --> 01:07:50,000
Oh, it was turbine.

1153
01:07:50,000 --> 01:07:53,000
Oh, I had a knockback.

1154
01:07:53,000 --> 01:07:55,000
Get over here.

1155
01:07:55,000 --> 01:07:56,000
It is morning.

1156
01:07:56,000 --> 01:07:57,000
It is nine.

1157
01:07:57,000 --> 01:08:02,000
Just about 10 a.m. here in the East Coast United States.

1158
01:08:06,000 --> 01:08:09,000
Oh, I've got it.

1159
01:08:09,000 --> 01:08:10,000
I thought it.

1160
01:08:10,000 --> 01:08:12,000
Oh, he only had like 2% health left.

1161
01:08:12,000 --> 01:08:15,000
10% 20, whatever.

1162
01:08:19,000 --> 01:08:22,000
It killed a guy.

1163
01:08:22,000 --> 01:08:25,000
This is why we can't have nice things.

1164
01:08:27,000 --> 01:08:28,000
Please, German.

1165
01:08:28,000 --> 01:08:31,000
Just please 1, 2, 4.

1166
01:08:31,000 --> 01:08:35,000
I think 2, 4 is, maybe I took it out of the rotation.

1167
01:08:35,000 --> 01:08:36,000
All right.

1168
01:08:36,000 --> 01:08:37,000
How about this?

1169
01:08:37,000 --> 01:08:39,000
Before I leave, I will switch the map to 2, 4.

1170
01:08:39,000 --> 01:08:40,000
How's that sound?

1171
01:08:40,000 --> 01:08:42,000
That does not sound good.

1172
01:08:42,000 --> 01:08:45,000
Yeah, this guy does.

1173
01:08:45,000 --> 01:08:47,000
Oh, my God.

1174
01:08:47,000 --> 01:08:50,000
That guy did not know that was coming.

1175
01:08:50,000 --> 01:08:53,000
Yeah, he was too busy hitting me.

1176
01:08:56,000 --> 01:08:59,000
Remember, if you crouch and just stand still when you're in a melee fight,

1177
01:08:59,000 --> 01:09:02,000
one-on-one, you're probably going to win.

1178
01:09:02,000 --> 01:09:03,000
Because people freak out too much.

1179
01:09:03,000 --> 01:09:06,000
They run around, they go, oh, it's this.

1180
01:09:06,000 --> 01:09:08,000
And hey, open that door.

1181
01:09:08,000 --> 01:09:09,000
Whoa.

1182
01:09:09,000 --> 01:09:10,000
I'm going to get the intelligence.

1183
01:09:10,000 --> 01:09:12,000
You know what, screw this.

1184
01:09:12,000 --> 01:09:13,000
Oh, never mind.

1185
01:09:13,000 --> 01:09:14,000
He already got it.

1186
01:09:14,000 --> 01:09:16,000
Good job, he's got it.

1187
01:09:17,000 --> 01:09:19,000
Good job, dude.

1188
01:09:19,000 --> 01:09:23,000
You typed 25 comments and haven't gotten a cheeseburger yet?

1189
01:09:23,000 --> 01:09:25,000
I think there's a YouTube bug.

1190
01:09:25,000 --> 01:09:28,000
You should have already gotten at least three cheeseburgers dispensed from your laptop.

1191
01:09:28,000 --> 01:09:29,000
Are you reading?

1192
01:09:29,000 --> 01:09:30,000
Well, just on the chat.

1193
01:09:30,000 --> 01:09:31,000
The stream.

1194
01:09:31,000 --> 01:09:33,000
How do you do that?

1195
01:09:35,000 --> 01:09:38,000
It's just, you make a...

1196
01:09:38,000 --> 01:09:41,000
I used to be all the time, sorry, I can't even speak.

1197
01:09:41,000 --> 01:09:42,000
To where stuff going on?

1198
01:09:42,000 --> 01:09:44,000
I'm sure I'm doing it.

1199
01:09:44,000 --> 01:09:51,000
You just do update comments automatically, and they'll come in as they come in.

1200
01:09:51,000 --> 01:09:55,000
I think there's still a minute or so behind, though, that's the thing with YouTube.

1201
01:09:55,000 --> 01:09:58,000
This isn't even pro-terbine.

1202
01:09:58,000 --> 01:10:00,000
There's no banana.

1203
01:10:00,000 --> 01:10:02,000
Pro-terbine?

1204
01:10:02,000 --> 01:10:03,000
Yeah.

1205
01:10:03,000 --> 01:10:06,000
And pro-terbine, there's a banana.

1206
01:10:06,000 --> 01:10:09,000
Is it really?

1207
01:10:09,000 --> 01:10:11,000
Well, they call it banana, but it's like a different path on the side.

1208
01:10:11,000 --> 01:10:14,000
It's shaped like a banana.

1209
01:10:14,000 --> 01:10:17,000
You should get a double cheeseburger.

1210
01:10:17,000 --> 01:10:20,000
You should come out of your...

1211
01:10:20,000 --> 01:10:23,000
out of your CD trade.

1212
01:10:23,000 --> 01:10:26,000
Every 25 comments that you make on the stream.

1213
01:10:26,000 --> 01:10:31,000
A double cheeseburger from your favorite restaurant comes out of your CD trade.

1214
01:10:31,000 --> 01:10:33,000
I don't have a CD trade.

1215
01:10:33,000 --> 01:10:34,000
That's probably why it's not working.

1216
01:10:34,000 --> 01:10:35,000
Yeah.

1217
01:10:35,000 --> 01:10:36,000
If you don't have a CD trade...

1218

1332
01:24:43,000 --> 01:24:48,000

1333
01:24:48,000 --> 01:24:53,000
lately is that just on spies yeah if a spy disguises as a pyro and they're wearing a certain

1334
01:24:53,000 --> 01:24:58,000
hat it can't display the hat oh she's or something like that oh god I that got his

1337
01:25:12,000 --> 01:25:21,000

1338
01:25:28,000 --> 01:25:36,000
what movies what films my planet on seeing probably I still haven't seen the Avengers I have to see the

1339
01:25:36,000 --> 01:25:46,000
avengers have you seen that star yep is it was it good yes I know it's good because there's explosions

1340
01:25:47,000 --> 01:25:51,000
but I had like a two hour long conversation with someone about why it's terrible really

1341
01:25:52,000 --> 01:25:56,000
just nothing makes sense if you watch it you need to question everything that happens and say why

1342
01:25:56,000 --> 01:26:07,000
use this happening and you will realize you don't know nobody knows the avengers I don't really

1343
01:26:07,000 --> 01:26:13,000
watch a lot of movies to be honest dark night yeah that's definitely one I mean yeah you have to see

1344
01:26:13,000 --> 01:26:19,000
that though that this is pretty much it's pretty much a moral obligation for every human being to

1345
01:26:19,000 --> 01:26:29,000
watch the crystal and all of that man movies like at least you know you're ubering a spy yeah I know

1346
01:26:30,000 --> 01:26:36,000
I'm aware of that I realize that like about two or three seconds into that uber I just thought I'd let you know

1347
01:26:36,000 --> 01:26:40,000
yeah I realized it because I realized especially when you ran the other direction when I ubered

1348
01:26:40,000 --> 01:26:45,000
him when he turned left and like went backwards I was like wait I did fight that way what are you doing

1380
01:30:48,000 --> 01:30:51,000
all right so now Diablo 3

1381
01:30:52,000 --> 01:31:04,000
super money and I combat I've it's I can't I can't get into it it's I don't know what it is

1382
01:31:04,000 --> 01:31:09,000
I'm not sure I have a couple of friends now that are really starting to enjoy it but I just can't

1383
01:31:09,000 --> 01:31:16,000
I don't know why they did just add a new game mode which is weird it's kind of like realism I guess

1384
01:31:16,000 --> 01:31:25,000
where everybody dies quicker really yeah I just I need to get into it at some point maybe I'm

1385
01:31:25,000 --> 01:31:33,000
not sure yet but is this even in the right spot like it is not quite hold on I'm gonna screen

1386
01:31:33,000 --> 01:31:39,000
I gotta go black for a second dudes you can even rocket jump in that game and I still don't

1387
01:31:39,000 --> 01:31:50,000
like it that much so I don't know what else there could be to encourage me to play um maybe hats

1388
01:31:51,000 --> 01:31:59,000
oh there are hats then yeah that's a good way to play screen region Diablo 3

1389
01:32:01,000 --> 01:32:08,000
is that and you know you can stream with DX story and it's better in screen region

1390
01:32:09,000 --> 01:32:19,000
really yeah whoa stream exception oh my god do you use DX story oh yeah yeah you do yeah I do I don't

1391
01:32:19,000 --> 01:32:25,000
stream with it though you should oh my good god every time I try to do a stupid window right now

1392
01:32:26,000 --> 01:32:30,000
it'll be magic all right I'm gonna try this one more time because this is being ridiculous

1393
01:32:31,000 --> 01:32:40,000
okay stream exception media that was just like I felt like I was looking through a tunnel right

1394
01:32:40,000 --> 01:32:46,000
there that might like I'm gonna like puke okay love of everything that is sacred can we get this

1395
01:32:46,000 --> 01:32:56,000
in the right spot yes you're story telling you but the X-Tory is expensive okay that's good enough

1396
01:32:57,000 --> 01:33:00,000
good enough good enough

1397
01:33:04,000 --> 01:33:07,000
all right nobody like steal my password

1398
01:33:12,000 --> 01:33:18,000
stolen hacked nobody steal my stuff because I have like a book I have like really good stuff

1399
01:33:18,000 --> 01:33:26,000
no I don't all right I'm on nightmare oh you like my like what you talk to name burglar

1400
01:33:27,000 --> 01:33:39,000
he's the burglar are you and I in a game I'm not in a game I'm on X3 nightmare no that's

1401
01:33:40,000 --> 01:33:47,000
I'm further than that well you have to come help me okay you have to okay sure everything's on

1402
01:33:47,000 --> 01:33:51,000
I'm sure you don't want to just kill asthma and 4,000 times that's right

1403
01:33:52,000 --> 01:33:57,000
now we're gonna make this game where you don't have to run the same bosses open over again

1404
01:33:59,000 --> 01:34:04,000
then we're gonna make asthma and give you all the experience every single cent of experience

1405
01:34:04,000 --> 01:34:09,000
I want in my bank account so for holon I gotta get over like the Diablo 3 lag for the first two

1406
01:34:09,000 --> 01:34:14,000
minutes and just like doing random moves I wonder I you know this gotta be a reason why that

1407
01:34:14,000 --> 01:34:19,000
happens it has to be because it's syncing you up with like the DRM or something like that it has

1408
01:34:19,000 --> 01:34:31,000
to be I don't know but you need to invite me that's right star invite to party invite to the party

1409
01:34:31,000 --> 01:34:35,000
yeah and now I'm gonna reject it be cool but please be like friend

1410
01:34:36,000 --> 01:34:38,000
nah turn burglar

1411
01:34:42,000 --> 01:34:48,000
the turn burglar that I was I made his name burglar because of like burgaboy

1412
01:34:53,000 --> 01:34:59,000
oh yeah little legs yeah you gotta get rid of the you gotta get rid of the initial lag of Diablo 3

1413
01:34:59,000 --> 01:35:08,000
oh who hooray all right I think we can do it

1414
01:35:11,000 --> 01:35:15,000
well it's the the reason why it lags is even when I'm not streaming when I'm just playing

1415
01:35:15,000 --> 01:35:21,000
just by myself the first like two or three minutes every time you play Diablo 3 for some reason

1416
01:35:21,000 --> 01:35:24,000
it just does this yeah do a new move and it's like wait what is this yeah you have to like let it

1417
01:35:24,000 --> 01:35:29,000
load Diablo 3 or anything it's sort it's sort of like Minecraft that's like the only way I can

1418
01:35:29,000 --> 01:35:33,000
really make an assumption to what it's kind of like you know Minecraft is like when you first

1419
01:35:33,000 --> 01:35:38,000
start playing it's like loading every single thing in the world see like no I have to load all this

1420
01:35:38,000 --> 01:35:45,000
stuff it'll leave it out in a minute I promise oh I did level a lot more of you I didn't even

1421
01:35:45,000 --> 01:35:56,000
yeah all in all I'm still like you know it's a good game um medium pizza medium a large cheese pizza yes

1422
01:35:58,000 --> 01:36:02,000
well pizza now let's go let's go with the lag

1423
01:36:07,000 --> 01:36:10,000
all right I want to get some rays some unique

1424
01:36:10,000 --> 01:36:11,000
thanks

1425
01:36:12,000 --> 01:36:16,000
all the people still people people are still seeing extreme exception no they're not in this

1426
01:36:16,000 --> 01:36:18,000
whereas that's just an old comment from somebody from a while back

1427
01:36:25,000 --> 01:36:28,000
I don't shoot arrows anymore I'm taking all the stuff on people still in there seeing

1428
01:36:30,000 --> 01:36:30,000
shouldn't be

1429
01:36:33,000 --> 01:36:35,000
well let me watch my own stream make sure nothing's happening

1430
01:36:36,000 --> 01:36:41,000
you should stream with the x story I gave the recommendation I mean I should

1431
01:36:41,000 --> 01:36:46,000
stream the stocks added teach you in two seconds every every time I stream when I did the

1432
01:36:46,000 --> 01:36:53,000
exploit game stream thing for some reason I don't know why it like it lags it lags really

1433
01:36:53,000 --> 01:37:00,000
really terribly oh no we're not getting streamception it looks okay what about 720

1434
01:37:00,000 --> 01:37:09,000
that looks okay too okay just making sure nothing was happening it's probably the youtube

1435
01:37:09,000 --> 01:37:21,000
comment system like all slow and dumb that's what it is so I'm playing which doctor

1436
01:37:23,000 --> 01:37:26,000
which doctor is very fun very good very cool

1437
01:37:30,000 --> 01:37:33,000
I am shooting bombs bombs

1438
01:37:35,000 --> 01:37:39,000
this is actually pretty cool build with demon hunter I found out that we just regenerate hatred

1439
01:37:39,000 --> 01:37:44,000
like ridiculous amounts of it you could use cluster arrow nonstop really that's true I was

1440
01:37:44,000 --> 01:37:55,000
amazing that's pretty cool pretty damn cool pretty snazzy pretty snazzy this guy's an elite in these

1441
01:37:55,000 --> 01:37:58,000
did he kill my little buddy oh he's back onward

1442
01:38:00,000 --> 01:38:08,000
I'm feeling maybe I shouldn't even be helping you my I don't know I've got it's 5300 damage it

1443
01:38:08,000 --> 01:38:20,000
feels wrong but I need the help get out of here huh already a rare really didn't think this

1444
01:38:20,000 --> 01:38:26,000
happened I thought it was just gonna be the sea of blue but I want one what do I think of the

1445
01:38:26,000 --> 01:38:34,000
spider-man reboot I think it's um not out yeah it's not out I mean I don't know I thought it was

1446
01:38:34,000 --> 01:38:39,000
gonna be like a Christopher Nolan type reboot but it's kind of everything's like I'll see GIE and stuff

1447
01:38:42,000 --> 01:38:48,000
I don't want to see it but I don't know man I'll probably see it just do some else leave

1448
01:38:48,000 --> 01:38:54,000
spider-man alone oh I'll probably watch it to be honest I was a big spider-man man I love the

1449
01:38:54,000 --> 01:39:03,000
first movie second one was good too oh boy hopefully uh this time they do anything with venom

1450
01:39:03,000 --> 01:39:13,000
even later on well please not like a total debag anything like that venom I have a cool face

1451
01:39:13,000 --> 01:39:20,000
and giant teeth but I pull my mask back to talk thanks yeah I didn't really like the way they

1452
01:39:20,000 --> 01:39:24,000
handled venom either it was kind of lack of luck I'm mad at you because you took my girlfriend or

1453
01:39:24,000 --> 01:39:31,000
something I don't remember what his deal was wasn't he also in the only in the movie for like

1454
01:39:31,000 --> 01:39:38,000
25 minutes the actual venom like symbiote monsters like that's less than that and the way he

1455
01:39:38,000 --> 01:39:46,000
beats him is like oh I gotta humiliate a guy like that why you gotta be like I thought you were a

1456
01:39:46,000 --> 01:40:00,000
good guy spider-man if you guys want to see my ruins I'll give you a little looksy looksy do

1457
01:40:02,000 --> 01:40:06,000
so this is poison I'm using poison dart and fire bats and I have it so it's just pretty much

1458
01:40:06,000 --> 01:40:13,000
pure damage so if you take a look poison dart I have it so it's then the the fire one so it just

1459
01:40:13,000 --> 01:40:18,000
doesn't more just straight up damage every time you hit somebody that is leveled up apparently oh I'm

1460
01:40:18,000 --> 01:40:27,000
sorry then fire bats I have the poison ones actually I got a new one I have ferrets hmm I'll stick with

1461
01:40:27,000 --> 01:40:35,000
the poison ones for now I think ferrets yeah I got the gargantuan the one that goes crazy when there's

1462
01:40:35,000 --> 01:40:42,000
more than a few people around yeah I got oh yeah yeah yeah so harvest because it is just

1463
01:40:43,000 --> 01:40:49,000
too good for not having intelligence is it giving you now 102 for every enemy affected so I get

1464
01:40:49,000 --> 01:40:57,000
I can get a fire like 550 and intelligence if I get five people oh it's that's a lot mask

1465
01:40:57,000 --> 01:41:02,000
confusion and then spirit walk mask confusion makes everyone hit themselves pretty much and spirit

1466
01:41:02,000 --> 01:41:07,000
walk is just amazing because it makes you pretty much unkillable you just go like this you go

1467
01:41:08,000 --> 01:41:15,000
and you run around very very awesome so do you have ferrets I don't I don't have ferrets

1468
01:41:15,000 --> 01:41:26,000
on let me turn on my uh ferrets make this a little my GPU fan a little higher like okay just to make sure

1469
01:41:27,000 --> 01:41:41,000
all right we're gonna go we're gonna find this is the spider lady isn't it um yeah she's down

1470
01:41:41,000 --> 01:41:48,000
away still now we we missed her we missed her all right if you were just here for the TF2 then take

1471
01:41:48,000 --> 01:41:50,000
it easy man thank you come

1472
01:41:54,000 --> 01:42:02,000
give me this gold my ferrets they pick up gold for me do they really the most yeah the most important

1473
01:42:02,000 --> 01:42:07,000
skill in the game it's pick up gold that is a really important skill because you have to like

1474
01:42:07,000 --> 01:42:13,000
go move over and run over and then crease gold fine just for being ferrets like I didn't know

1475
01:42:13,000 --> 01:42:20,000
ferrets did that but they're rolling in it rolling in those ferrets

1476
01:42:23,000 --> 01:42:31,000
so we went the wrong way it's Diablo 3 that's the name of the game in D3 going the wrong way it

1477
01:42:31,000 --> 01:42:37,000
almost feels sometimes like it generates the map as you go somewhere like go you went this way

1478
01:42:37,000 --> 01:42:46,000
looks generated so many little spider freaks oh god come on go get him got ganchoan

1479
01:42:47,000 --> 01:42:51,000
so though we were talking about the ganchoan the little buddy that I have for a pet

1480
01:42:54,000 --> 01:42:57,000
and we we can't have the conclusion that this is what he's doing so I'll try and do the voice

1481
01:42:59,000 --> 01:43:01,000
I don't know if we get it through the spite

1482
01:43:01,000 --> 01:43:08,000
so ready so this is look at how like cutie is so ready just like

1483
01:43:08,000 --> 01:43:17,000
fresh fresh that's the noise he's making when he runs

1484
01:43:17,000 --> 01:43:22,000
and he's got a diaper to be that you run I hit this guy I help you

1485
01:43:22,000 --> 01:43:31,000
I'm out at her I just feel like he's big dumb cute but I'm gonna die doesn't it lead right here

1486
01:43:33,000 --> 01:43:37,000
it's okay I'll hold you yikes

1487
01:43:42,000 --> 01:43:48,000
confusion all right let's get a rare so yeah I thought I had a really cool skill that

1488
01:43:48,000 --> 01:43:54,000
could rival your mask confusion because it knocks everything back for like 10 seconds really it

1489
01:43:54,000 --> 01:44:00,000
doesn't work on rares the really like all rares are immune to knockback that's kind of

1490
01:44:00,000 --> 01:44:07,000
vs yeah I was kind of gonna go like all knockback demon under there's Diablo 2

1491
01:44:09,000 --> 01:44:15,000
I probably still am it's just kind of like that rares are gonna be like this okay you might get one

1492
01:44:15,000 --> 01:44:18,000
back up a little bit

1493
01:44:26,000 --> 01:44:29,000
hey jamer can you make a shout out to edgel like in the stream just say your name

1494
01:44:31,000 --> 01:44:31,000
what's up edgel

1495
01:44:31,000 --> 01:44:40,000
I think it's around edgel edgel waffles yes

1496
01:44:43,000 --> 01:44:47,000
oh god yes please I actually don't like waffles I go waffles at least I know I know that's

1497
01:44:47,000 --> 01:44:52,000
blasphemy I know like Belgium waffles are better naturally I mean

1498
01:44:52,000 --> 01:44:53,000
I mean

1499
01:44:57,000 --> 01:45:02,000
I you know waffles are just two it's almost like too much it's too doughy ready for me

1500
01:45:02,000 --> 01:45:06,000
same thing with pancakes I'm not a big pancake person either wow

1501
01:45:09,000 --> 01:45:15,000
I did not need to know that about you I don't think anyone need to know that about you

1502
01:45:15,000 --> 01:45:19,000
like everyone is leaving the stream right now because I said that

1503
01:45:19,000 --> 01:45:26,000
yeah well what's the point of watching this if this guy doesn't even like pancakes I thought we

1504
01:45:26,000 --> 01:45:34,000
could like bond on some sort of human level but apparently not I thought we were gonna be friends

1505
01:45:36,000 --> 01:45:40,000
well why would I want to be friends with you now I need help do I have any potions that I'm not

1506
01:45:40,000 --> 01:45:48,000
using I gotta run back to town real quick you don't like pancakes unsubbed no I love pancakes come

1507
01:45:48,000 --> 01:45:57,000
back I was only joking you know I the only pancakes I like are are chocolate chip pancakes that's it

1508
01:45:59,000 --> 01:46:03,000
everything else I'm not a big fan of are you just like trying to run your name into the ground

1509
01:46:03,000 --> 01:46:09,000
but chocolate chip pancakes are really good what's wrong with that chocolate chip pancakes this

1510
01:46:09,000 --> 01:46:14,000
is a breakfast food we were talking about yeah you want to put chocolate chips in would you put

1511
01:46:14,000 --> 01:46:21,000
like chocolate chips and scrambled eggs and be like oh good idea yeah but scrimp eggs are like eggs

1512
01:46:21,000 --> 01:46:27,000
then they're not like pancakes are sweet you know all right let me let me give you a rebuttal

1513
01:46:27,000 --> 01:46:34,000
would you put cheese on your pancakes I'm sure that wouldn't be that bad I don't think so I don't

1514
01:46:34,000 --> 01:46:41,000
know about that what does cheese go badly with besides chocolate chips I'm like a glass of

1515
01:46:41,000 --> 01:46:46,000
chocolate milk feel like put easy cheese in it well besides anything chocolate

1516
01:46:49,000 --> 01:46:53,000
well when does chocolate go bad you you just made my point for me

1517
01:46:57,000 --> 01:47:00,000
I'm trying to say chocolate doesn't go with anything wait this is just eat chocolate

1518
01:47:03,000 --> 01:47:09,000
chocolate ice cream chocolate milkshake chocolate straw berries yeah all by

1519
01:47:09,000 --> 01:47:17,000
the point is I'm right I just said I just have to go back to town again because I forgot I've

1520
01:47:17,000 --> 01:47:27,000
went hit a buy potions and I didn't chocolate chip pancakes that's the best part about the

1521
01:47:27,000 --> 01:47:32,000
apple three is what is your time to consider the important parts of life that we weren't talking

1522
01:47:32,000 --> 01:47:37,000
about this one playing TF2 but now we're down to the root well now we have a little it's a little

1523
01:47:37,000 --> 01:47:43,000
more laid back we get some time to discuss things laid back it's a little more laid back I would

1524
01:47:43,000 --> 01:47:52,000
consider this more serious this is so serious it's Diablo here I am clicking on things and you're

1525

1547
01:50:24,000 --> 01:50:30,000
we did a full circle we did but that's we need to XP and we need to add them to oh I didn't even

01:50:59,000 --> 01:51:08,000
um I'm I'm gonna be losing like 2000 life I put this on but I'm gonna gain a ton of damage

1553
01:51:09,000 --> 01:51:16,000

1554
01:51:16,000 --> 01:51:25,000
almost a thousand more damage it's up blue we'll do it yeah we'll do it and temporarily I'm just

1559
01:52:04,000 --> 01:52:06,000
you know what's all this what do you drop in I want to look

1560
01:52:07,000 --> 01:52:12,000
but imagine if this is what the elbow three was we just stand in place and items fall what's this

1561
01:52:12,000 --> 01:52:17,000
we know what's that what's this what's this this magic in the air what's this what's this

1562
01:52:19,000 --> 01:52:22,000
all right 20 germapoints do whoever figures out what that song is for up

1563
01:52:24,000 --> 01:52:27,000
that's the only remember what you can buy germapoints

1564
01:52:29,000 --> 01:52:35,000
I don't think anything to be on but you can still buy a salad you can buy a germap salad

1565
01:52:35,000 --> 01:52:43,000
but 15 germapoints don't sell it germapoints give it to me there's probably chocolate chips in the

1566
01:52:43,000 --> 01:52:49,000
germapoints I don't know if people want it you know I can't believe that you uh that you don't like

1567
01:52:49,000 --> 01:52:53,000
chocolate chip pancakes that's that's that's unbelievable I've never actually had them just because

1568
01:52:53,000 --> 01:53:00,000
the thought of that is absolutely rare disgusting disgusting chocolate chip oh it's an off-hand

1569
01:53:00,000 --> 01:53:08,000
hold on oh man oh man gosh she got oh I can't I don't have time to look at that but I think it's

1570
01:53:08,000 --> 01:53:18,000
better I'm a witch doctor I am a witch doctor star is a demon hunter we're two best friends in

1571
01:53:18,000 --> 01:53:26,000
Diablo three I hunt demons except sometimes they help me make sense makes sense

1572
01:53:29,000 --> 01:53:39,000
the bones I carry a bow and confusion mask confusion everyone's not fight each other

1573
01:53:40,000 --> 01:53:47,000
oh my god too much it's a good thing you don't have that health

1574
01:53:48,000 --> 01:53:56,000
good thing I could need it I could need it I could use it oh we got the lead watch out we got

1575
01:53:56,000 --> 01:54:01,000
it lead any he's got that pole move any slows you down that's just fantastic he did

1576
01:54:01,000 --> 01:54:13,000
he has all the things he dropped any yeah those of you that said nightmare before Christmas

1577
01:54:13,000 --> 01:54:19,000
you uh you are a winner you get my right I'm gonna I'm gonna put my hand up the screen right now

1578
01:54:19,000 --> 01:54:25,000
and it's a high five oh hey come here hey fuck fuck where you go what's that

1579
01:54:25,000 --> 01:54:33,000
wait where do you keep finding these I don't know floor how come I'm not finding these and

1580
01:54:34,000 --> 01:54:41,000
oh it's way better than what I have thank you that did not just find so many items I don't know what you do

1581
01:54:43,000 --> 01:54:54,000
uh no where there it is 231947 intellect it's way better but it's way yeah critical hit chance though

1582
01:54:56,000 --> 01:55:03,000
it's got 2.5% crit on it this does not have it but oh hey what's your amulet I'll inspect you I'll

1583
01:55:03,000 --> 01:55:10,000
inspect you I'm gonna put this on I'm gonna put a vitality gem in that because I I'm under 10k

1584
01:55:10,000 --> 01:55:15,000
health right now is awful just like this amulet tell me if you're like interested and you can

1585
01:55:15,000 --> 01:55:23,000
just have it anyway all right like seriously you have just replaced like six pieces of my gear

1586
01:55:24,000 --> 01:55:31,000
okay the critical hit damage this this I have a rare on 30 what do you think 30% more crit damage

1587
01:55:31,000 --> 01:55:37,000
or extra health and a little bit more damage how much are you critting with mask confusion um 10

1588
01:55:37,000 --> 01:55:42,000
million I think I'm gonna leave it on because I do pretty big crits with poison dart

1589
01:55:42,000 --> 01:55:49,000
it's the treasure google

1590
01:55:53,000 --> 01:55:55,000
hmm

1591
01:55:59,000 --> 01:56:07,000
what I recommend getting d3 compared to d2 hmm I probably not there is this really good game

1592
01:56:07,000 --> 01:56:12,000
called you know I think this is treasure goblin where's he why is all his money over here

1593
01:56:14,000 --> 01:56:16,000
why was that money right there where's this goblin that was the goblin like

1594
01:56:16,000 --> 01:56:24,000
go you know um d2 is one of my favorite games ever made so I'm very very biased when it comes

1595
01:56:24,000 --> 01:56:30,000
to comparing the obelotu and the obelotary but the obelotu I mean this game is awesome

1596
01:56:30,000 --> 01:56:34,000
man I'm playing it right now I've I've dumped a ton of time into it but if you were a huge fan of

1597
01:56:34,000 --> 01:56:39,000
the obelotu then it's if you saw I did a review on this game already it's on the channel but

1598
01:56:41,000 --> 01:56:44,000
it's it's kind of a left-down in the item department at least as of right now they're gonna

1599
01:56:44,000 --> 01:56:49,000
apparently they're gonna maybe potentially look at legendaries because where it stands right now

1600
01:56:49,000 --> 01:56:55,000
a legendary item can be potentially worse than a blue which is that's just just shouldn't be

1601
01:56:55,000 --> 01:57:01,000
happening but for the most part I mean if you've never played a Diablo game this is a perfect time

1602
01:57:01,000 --> 01:57:05,000
to get into it because this game is just it's a very streamlined it's very fond very addicting

1603
01:57:06,000 --> 01:57:10,000
I say yes go buy go buy it if you've never if you've never played Diablo before and you want to

1604
01:57:10,000 --> 01:57:13,000
then check it out for sure it's awesome

1605
01:57:17,000 --> 01:57:25,000
star oh god oh my god oh my god oh my god too many blue oh no oh my god my friend my my god

1606
01:57:25,000 --> 01:57:35,000
I can't you would he died now he almost it he grew stabilizers you did to have like when you go home

1607
01:57:35,000 --> 01:57:40,000
with your witch doctor on the wall you need to put notches on the wall for how high or gargantuan

1608
01:57:40,000 --> 01:57:46,000
girls well I want to look at something real quick give me one second okay oh hide and corner

1609
01:57:46,000 --> 01:57:52,000
with you how far behind is this dream like this three like I think this I think my 720 stream is

1610
01:57:52,000 --> 01:57:57,000
like seven years behind that happens oh let me let me take a look at this

1611
01:58:00,000 --> 01:58:05,000
because that's like so people are still like just answering that nightmare before Christmas and that

1612
01:58:05,000 --> 01:58:10,000
was like five minutes ago so I want to see I want to see just how far back it is

1613
01:58:12,000 --> 01:58:19,000
somebody said 15 seconds actually no the youtube comment system is probably just bugged like it

1614
01:58:19,000 --> 01:58:25,000
always is I probably said that before yeah oh why am I I'm watching an ad ad

1615
01:58:31,000 --> 01:58:39,000
adception right there ads on top of ads on top of ads they're advertising an ad go watch this ad

1616
01:58:42,000 --> 01:58:46,000
please go watch this ad on top of this ad on top of this ad go watch this ad

1617
01:58:46,000 --> 01:58:52,000
there are many to stop Dan from let me see let me see go watch this ad on top of this ad

1618
01:58:52,000 --> 01:58:56,000
you're go watch this ad my hatred is too low for this

1619
01:58:58,000 --> 01:59:04,000
yeah I guess if you are behind on 720 then oh my god what am I dead from

1620
01:59:05,000 --> 01:59:12,000
if you're behind on 720 then refer I died oh

1621
01:59:13,000 --> 01:59:18,000
so my fault no it's my fault if you're behind on 720 refresh the page because that'll

1622
01:59:18,000 --> 01:59:23,000
put that I'll get you back in check because some people are like five to ten minutes behind

1623
01:59:28,000 --> 01:59:34,000
why don't I have ad block on um because I mean at least for youtube I like to support

1624
01:59:34,000 --> 01:59:40,000
youtubers like at least people that run ads on their videos so like if I have a friend or

1625
01:59:40,000 --> 01:59:45,000
something that has ads I usually keep it on just because I like to be nice to them I don't know

1626
01:59:48,000 --> 01:59:52,000
pretty good guy plus can't ad block block other stuff it's that kind of not supposed to

1627
01:59:54,000 --> 02:00:00,000
I don't think so what's the not supposed to block I don't know like I remember like hearing that

1628
02:00:00,000 --> 02:00:03,000
some it's some places like it might think something is an ad when it's not

1629
02:00:03,000 --> 02:00:13,000
I don't think I see anything like that do you have ad block I do I turn it off sometimes though

1630
02:00:13,000 --> 02:00:18,000
usually when I watch streams or whatever yeah I assume that's what a lot of people do because I

1631
02:00:18,000 --> 02:00:22,000
mean I I guess it can get really annoying like if you're just browsing websites and it's like oh

1632
02:00:22,000 --> 02:00:28,000
take over your entire screen with an ad I hate those I would like to open like four pages to tell

1633
02:00:28,000 --> 02:00:32,000
you that this is an ad yeah the worst thing is gonna open it until you to watch the other page

1634
02:00:33,000 --> 02:00:41,000
oh that did I for a second I thought we just beat her but I was I was looking at the chat

1635
02:00:48,000 --> 02:00:51,000
she's done kill the daughters of pain

1636
02:00:52,000 --> 02:00:57,000
the story's in hot wait did she she really did died didn't she

1637
02:00:58,000 --> 02:01:04,000
oh no that's that's like her like introduce myself thing isn't it oh yeah this is the one

1638
02:01:04,000 --> 02:01:08,000
where she doesn't even fight you she just like shows up and is like hey and then you shoot her once

1639
02:01:08,000 --> 02:01:14,000
and she says no she just introduces herself hi I'm a spider yeah somebody said ad blockers

1640
02:01:14,000 --> 02:01:18,000
didn't mess up some for honestly for this part I was flying through when I was doing with this

1641
02:01:18,000 --> 02:01:23,000
character and I was thinking myself that you probably were supposed to beat her there and there

1642
02:01:23,000 --> 02:01:29,000
was probably supposed to be a different boss later and they just are like no yeah baby no I'm

1643
02:01:29,000 --> 02:01:36,000
old as a letter glitter run away really feels like that feels like that with a lot of stuff in this game

1644
02:01:37,000 --> 02:01:41,000
but there are other patch in it there's apparently a big patch they're working on for this game

1645
02:01:41,000 --> 02:01:46,000
and I don't they haven't said anything about it but let's let's wait and see what it is I hope it's

02:05:32,000 --> 02:05:34,000
I

1676
02:05:35,000 --> 02:05:42,000
potions are very expensive that's why I got ferrets ferrets

blowdart let me check this out let's see oh it's okay cool it's a lot less

1687
02:06:33,000 --> 02:06:37,000
group not really a crowd boob anymore it's kind of a single target move now

1688
02:06:39,000 --> 02:06:46,000
I should go to whimsy shire I'm not at that stage I'm a noob I'm not ready for

1690
02:06:53,000 --> 02:06:59,000

1691
02:07:01,000 --> 02:07:07,000
blows through mana like crazy though I don't know if I like it I'll try it for a little while

1692
02:07:12,000 --> 02:07:15,000
uh I'm not picking up pages of jewel crafting only because I'm it's not something I point

1693
02:07:15,000 --> 02:07:19,000

1694
02:07:20,000 --> 02:07:24,000
yeah I mean it's I'm in nightmare right now so the pages of jewel crafting

1695

run away go get him bats

1697
02:07:40,000 --> 02:07:43,000

1706
02:08:45,000 --> 02:08:53,000
fine the time is it so almost 20 of 11 am oh yeah it tells you the time in Diablo

1707
02:08:53,000 --> 02:08:57,000
yeah remember we were talking about that it's like oh how much time we lost oh there it is

1708
02:08:57,000 --> 02:09:00,000
in my dex story it was covered but actually it's on the left now

1709
02:09:01,000 --> 02:09:05,000
the sin hot

1710
02:09:08,000 --> 02:09:09,000
get that way point

1711
02:09:13,000 --> 02:09:15,000
bats bats everywhere

1712
02:09:19,000 --> 02:09:20,000
give me that money give me that money

1713
02:09:23,000 --> 02:09:29,000
yo money good fusion see I used it to a good time that time didn't are you proud of it

1714
02:09:29,000 --> 02:09:32,000
I am there was it was a lot of reasons to do that

1715
02:09:35,000 --> 02:09:40,000
I might have to take off that passive skill what makes all my mana stuff cost more money

1716
02:09:40,000 --> 02:09:43,000
mean more mana oh makes all my mana cost more money

1717
02:09:45,000 --> 02:09:53,000
I mean no matter cost more mana for what it's yeah it's all of your damages increased by 20%

1718
02:09:53,000 --> 02:10:00,000
but every spell cost 30% more mana but that's so good that's it's so much more damage than I

1719
02:10:00,000 --> 02:10:08,000
wouldn't be doing squeaky chair wait wait

1720
02:10:14,000 --> 02:10:18,000
I'll probably be playing Diablo 3 I mean today you mean today

1721
02:10:18,000 --> 02:10:25,000
hmm it probably after we kill um aspa then once we get to the last part of this act

1722
02:10:26,000 --> 02:10:32,000
I might take a break but if you met long-term I'll be playing this game for probably very long time

1723
02:10:33,000 --> 02:10:38,000
I would say if it turns out after all the patches and all the bug fixes and

1724
02:10:39,000 --> 02:10:44,000
after the initial launch period then but all stays well and it's all good I'll be playing this game

1725
02:10:44,000 --> 02:10:49,000
for a very very very long time yeah okay you're here this game I'm exel

1726
02:10:50,000 --> 02:10:55,000
I really still need to play uh most Mxc mostly 3-mm elimination challenge yes did you actually

1727
02:10:55,000 --> 02:11:03,000
install a D2 I actually did not but I could that I'll take two seconds it's only like a one gig file to be

1728
02:11:03,000 --> 02:11:08,000
honest or did you download it I think I have to download it so it shouldn't take that long to

1729
02:11:08,000 --> 02:11:17,000
do when you download it and install it don't open it oh okay I think actually I think I still have

1730
02:11:17,000 --> 02:11:22,000
I think I downloaded it on this computer a long time ago I think it's just still sitting like

1731
02:11:22,000 --> 02:11:28,000
the installation file is just still sitting on the computer somewhere I'd like to ask you a

1732
02:11:28,000 --> 02:11:33,000
very serious question right now okay what is with the dudes in the background what is your theory

1733
02:11:34,000 --> 02:11:42,000
on why you can never see their feet um they're having a party and they're the pinata

1734
02:11:45,000 --> 02:11:51,000
these poor guys I mean as men would certainly have a much higher chance of winning this whole war

1735
02:11:51,000 --> 02:11:55,000
if you just like unchained yeah you oh watch out for the disco ball just like one of them

1736
02:11:56,000 --> 02:11:59,000
you unchained one of those guys he will take out an entire city yeah I don't know

1737
02:12:00,000 --> 02:12:02,000
maybe they they're not that good at fighting

1738
02:12:06,000 --> 02:12:11,000
so they're good at what do they do why are they here well I mean look look think of it this way

1739
02:12:12,000 --> 02:12:15,000
these guys are probably not that strong at this point they've been kind of chained up with like

1740
02:12:15,000 --> 02:12:20,000
stuff in their heads why I don't I don't think they'd be that tough anymore if you release them

1741
02:12:20,000 --> 02:12:27,000
they'd probably just fall over and go well even if they just fell over that'd be a pretty big fall

1742
02:12:28,000 --> 02:12:34,000
they can fall in the right spot maybe they can fall around and be like change my diaper

1743
02:12:36,000 --> 02:12:41,000
you don't want that in her I get through wherever you're so close now so close

1744
02:12:43,000 --> 02:12:52,000
oh yeah you destroyed the synhot I can't believe you oh dear you second important question

1745
02:12:52,000 --> 02:12:58,000
yeah why is there no elevator here yeah and you know what follow up important question how did

1746
02:12:58,000 --> 02:13:07,000
azmedan get down here like did he he didn't come down these stairs he's too big was he just like

1747
02:13:07,000 --> 02:13:13,000
born in the bottom and it just never goes anywhere he doesn't ever go out I guess like oh

1748
02:13:13,000 --> 02:13:19,000
I mean like here's my house my big azmedan house I'm like a 75 foot tall like 9 million

1749
02:13:19,000 --> 02:13:25,000
pollen monster let me walk down my spiral staircase when you can like astral project images of your

1750
02:13:25,000 --> 02:13:31,000
heads you can talk shit to people like when that's your thing I don't imagine going out yeah I

1751
02:13:31,000 --> 02:13:38,000
probably just sit there like call x girlfriend you have no hope put the put dive

1752
02:13:44,000 --> 02:13:46,000
eat it bats eat bats

1753
02:13:49,000 --> 02:13:58,000
more bats stand in the middle oh god oh god oh god yeah I need I need a more crowd move this

1754
02:13:58,000 --> 02:14:03,000
this is this big very single target it's not sure I'm gonna stick with it or I'm gonna have to change

1755
02:14:03,000 --> 02:14:12,000
boys and dark something else maybe he uses teleportation that is a good theory that is a good theory

1756
02:14:12,000 --> 02:14:22,000
maybe I mean he is the lord of uh uh sin beer I was saying beer did you say beer no I said beer

1757
02:14:23,000 --> 02:14:29,000
azmedan lord of beer oh yeah azmedan like he owns a micro brewery a lot of beer

1758
02:14:30,000 --> 02:14:37,000
how dare you oh god I'm dead I'm gonna die right now how dare you insult the lord of beer

1759
02:14:38,000 --> 02:14:48,000
yeah well oh in the fear of my delicious hops and yees time you know I thought he was fearing that's

1760
02:14:48,000 --> 02:14:59,000
why he was always uh lord of sin getting off on that he is a weird one he does live with a spider

1761
02:14:59,000 --> 02:15:06,000
lady that's hell bent on making us like love her but hate her at the same time why won't you bang me

1762
02:15:06,000 --> 02:15:10,000
this is his roommate by the way you know that says you that's what you got to live with I would go crazy

1763
02:15:10,000 --> 02:15:18,000
to his wife or something maybe he just got drunk one night and woke up down there is what someone said

1764
02:15:18,000 --> 02:15:24,000
she just won't leave like oh man where am I you have job showed shit face right now what is this

1765
02:15:24,000 --> 02:15:34,000
place I own it now oh this is mine oh this is mine

1766
02:15:36,000 --> 02:15:46,000
yeah I think he doesn't even know why these giant tall guys are here all right this definitely

1767
02:15:46,000 --> 02:15:52,000
gets comment of the stream uh damn it I want to take a dump well you guys talk louder so I can hear

1768
02:15:52,000 --> 02:16:06,000
you from the crap oh my god oh my goodness getter yeah I can't even stun that that move only works

1769
02:16:06,000 --> 02:16:13,000
on like actual enemies unfortunate all right kill him before the teleport kill him before the

1770
02:16:13,000 --> 02:16:23,000
teleport oh he's just lying down die die die die what's your like a normal and one shot or maybe we're

1771
02:16:23,000 --> 02:16:32,000
getting it oh wow well blow up at one of asthma dance like four hearts is he a cow or something

1772
02:16:33,000 --> 02:16:40,000

1774
02:16:47,000 --> 02:16:52,000
dirt oh look oh come on it's starting to make sense what's what is it this is one of those big

1775
02:16:52,000 --> 02:17:01,000
guys chests it's ripped open and the heart is placed over here what what you see that's why would

1776
02:17:01,000 --> 02:17:12,000
they do such a thing and then the heart powers door sale I don't get how the hearts power is

1777
02:17:12,000 --> 02:17:16,000
well how come how come then look at this guy how come this guy isn't like has a sin heart maybe

1778
02:17:16,000 --> 02:17:19,000
he's not cool enough maybe you didn't like I guess they're I guess they're like harvesting them like

1779
02:17:19,000 --> 02:17:25,000
okay seriously seriously look at this there is no way as madden can fit down this staircase look

1780
02:17:25,000 --> 02:17:30,000
at this there's no way look at this look at look at look at the height I'm pointing at the screen

1781
02:17:30,000 --> 02:17:36,000
right now by the way I don't know why the height of this ceiling look at this oh I'm gonna go

1782
02:17:36,000 --> 02:17:40,000
in my door like he wouldn't even be able to get in here just jump down like he isn't used to

1783
02:17:40,000 --> 02:17:49,000
stay so just run fat and he rolls off the edge somebody asked how was this early morning um I

1784
02:17:49,000 --> 02:17:53,000
started this anymore well yeah yeah I started this straight I've been going for a couple hours at

1785
02:17:53,000 --> 02:18:03,000
least a few hours it was it was early morning when I started I am here so after this I'm probably

1786
02:18:03,000 --> 02:18:09,000
gonna close the stream out for a little while I might come back I'm not sure though probably not

1787
02:18:09,000 --> 02:18:15,000
because I want to get some food in my way I might go to the gym but get the way point where about

1788
02:18:15,000 --> 02:18:21,000
