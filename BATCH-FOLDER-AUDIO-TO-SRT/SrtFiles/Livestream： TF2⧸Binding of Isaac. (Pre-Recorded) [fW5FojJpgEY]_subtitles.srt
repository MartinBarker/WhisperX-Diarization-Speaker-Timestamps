1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,000
The critic song.

2
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:10,000
So, dudes.

3
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:15,000
Oh, he's close out some of the windows.

4
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:17,000
Okay.

5
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:21,000
Whoa.

6
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:22,000
Whoa. All right.

7
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:25,000
Important, very, very important for the stream starts.

8
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:28,000
I set up a new virtual audio cables thing.

9
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:35,000
And I want you guys to tell me if you can hear the music that is about to start playing.

10
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:38,000
So let me know because otherwise it will be no sound.

11
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:39,000
So ready?

12
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:43,000
Let me know if you can hear the medic music.

13
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:44,000
Oh yeah.

14
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:49,000
Can you guys hear that?

15
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:51,000
Okay.

16
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:55,000
Good to know because that means I set the audio cable thing up correctly.

17
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:59,000
So that's good to know.

18
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:02,000
Loud and clear, Burger Boy.

19
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:04,000
All right.

20
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:08,000
So tonight, first of all, happy Saturday.

21
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:11,000
Hope you guys are having a fantastic Saturday.

22
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:13,000
Second of all, of course, grandpa is tonight.

23
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:14,000
There's a lot of things going on tonight.

24
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:18,000
There's a lot of things going on in the world of Jeremy.

25
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:20,000
Did a video, doing a live stream.

26
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:23,000
Grandpa is tonight on Machinima.

27
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:26,000
A lot of crazy stuff.

28
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:28,000
So I've been all over the place today.

29
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:35,000
Flow me.

30
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:36,000
Do it.

31
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:37,000
All right.

32
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:38,000
All right.

33
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:39,000
Let him explain himself.

34
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:41,000
Let him explain himself.

35
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:42,000
All right, Flow me.

36
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:45,000
You have 10 words to explain yourself.

37
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:56,000
10 words.

38
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:58,000
In 10 words or less.

39
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:04,000
All right.

40
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:05,000
I'm going to get rid of that.

41
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:09,000
Two plus two is four.

42
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:13,000
All right.

43
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:15,000
So let me just, where's my phone?

44
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:19,000
Oh, I always am losing my damn phone.

45
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:21,000
It always happens.

46
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:22,000
Oh, down.

47
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:24,000
I think it's across the road.

48
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:26,000
There it is.

49
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:27,000
Hello, phone.

50
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:31,000
All right.

51
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:38,000
Oh, if you're watching this on YouTube,

52
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:40,000
like eventually when I upload this tomorrow,

53
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:42,000
if you're watching this on YouTube,

54
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:44,000
you go ahead and you can skip two or three minutes

55
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:45,000
while I set this up.

56
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:46,000
I know I put an annotation there,

57
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:47,000
but sometimes people go,

58
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:49,000
whoa, when do you start?

59
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:50,000
So go ahead and skip a couple minutes

60
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:52,000
if you're watching this on the YouTube's.

61
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:56,000
Okay.

62
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:57,000
Twitter.

63
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:58,000
Hello, Twitter.

64
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:03,000
So yeah, Team Fortress 2 and Binding of Isaac.

65
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:05,000
And you're probably wondering,

66
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:08,000
why am I playing that crazy ridiculous disturbing game?

67
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:11,000
Well, because this DLC for coming out in like a couple days.

68
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:13,000
So I want to get back into it,

69
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:14,000
because I love back in.

70
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:16,000
So let's see.

71
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:17,000
Let's see.

72
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:18,000
Streaming.

73
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:21,000
G.

74
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:22,000
F.

75
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:23,000
Two.

76
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:25,000
And Binding of Isaac.

77
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:30,000
Oh, come here.

78
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:39,000
H.T.T.P.

79
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:41,000
Clones.

80
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:42,000
Lash.

81
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:43,000
W.W.

82
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:44,000
Yes.

83
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:47,000
Twitch.

84
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:48,000
Twitch.

85
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:49,000
Twitch.

86
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:50,000
Twitch TV.

87
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:52,000
Fun.

88
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:54,000
I'm not gonna run on it, but.

89
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:56,000
Don't ask me why I always do this on my phone.

90
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:58,000
I just like don't feel like opening up another tab.

91
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:02,000
Like it's probably faster if I did it on my Dan computer.

92
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:05,000
There's that.

93
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:06,000
Is that all right.

94
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:08,000
Ready to go here in a second.

95
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:12,000
Just gonna put a steam message out to the steam community.

96
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:14,000
I have to be, oh my.

97
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:15,000
Oh, what?

98
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:16,000
New name apparently.

99
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:18,000
Massive bus accident.

100
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:21,000
Is my name on here.

101
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:24,000
Well, that's one way to do have your name B.

102
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:25,000
Whatever.

103
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:28,000
Massive bus accident.

104
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:34,000
Oh, weird.

105
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:36,000
Streaming.

106
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:37,000
Yes.

107
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:47,000
Oh, I don't think that's so funny.

108
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:56,000
Oh, screaming now.

109
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:57,000
Oh.

110
00:04:57,000 --> 00:05:08,000
Colin's last night.

111
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:09,000
Streaming.

112
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:15,000
I actually put this here.

113
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:16,000
Oh, man.

114
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:19,000
Do you have to do a body of my.

115
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:20,000
Just waiting.

116
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:25,000
I'll change that.

117
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:27,000
Open my face.

118
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:31,000
This party.

119
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:34,000
15 minutes.

120
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:35,000
All right.

121
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:36,000
Oh, God.

122
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:39,000
Oh, no.

123
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:41,000
Oh, no.

124
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:45,000
It is like duped and drank on my floor.

125
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:47,000
Oh, God.

126
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:50,000
Oh, God.

127
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:53,000
Oh, you know what?

128
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:55,000
I'm going to stay in there.

129
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:57,000
This is staying there.

130
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:59,000
I'll deal with it later.

131
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:00,000
God.

132
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:03,000
What a pro.

133
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:06,000
Oh, okay.

134
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:11,000
It's like a cup of milk on my floor right now.

135
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:13,000
That is not cool.

136
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:14,000
Whatever.

137
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:16,000
The show must go on.

138
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:21,000
Let's do it.

139
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:24,000
That's that.

140
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:29,000
And here's the tweet.

141
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:32,000
I can't believe that.

142
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:36,000
Milk does a body good unless you dump it on your floor.

143
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:39,000
I don't know.

144
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:45,000
Geez, Louise.

145
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:47,000
Is that work?

146
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:48,000
It was fun though.

147
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:50,000
Nice like avatar.

148
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:53,000
All right.

149
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:56,000
We're good to go.

150
00:06:56,000 --> 00:07:00,000
We're good to go.

151
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:07,000
Oh.

152
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:08,000
Okay.

153
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:12,000
Now I'm going to make the chat so I can see it.

154
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:15,000
Good Lord.

155
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:18,000
Well, that was not cool.

156
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:21,000
It's good to server with zero people in it.

157
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:24,000
And my T-F2 server is coming along.

158
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:28,000
I know I said last week it was going to be done this week but it's not.

159
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:31,000
It's close though.

160
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:35,000
I have to talk to the guys at game servers.com.

161
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:38,000
We have to have a meeting.

162
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:41,000
Some type of meeting.

163
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:44,000
What's up, dudes?

164
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:47,000
If you're just joining us.

165
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:50,000
I'm just going to spend a couple of milk on my floor.

166
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:53,000
And it's going to stay there until I'm done screaming.

167
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:55,000
I hope I don't ruin anything.

168
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:58,000
If it like seeps over near my computer, that's going to be really bad.

169
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:01,000
That might as well be like an emergency stop.

170
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:02,000
All right.

171
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:05,000
Let's go to...

172
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:07,000
No, no toot forward.

173
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:09,000
No, dust bowl.

174
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:12,000
We play dust bowl too much.

175
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:15,000
How about...

176
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:22,000
A gravel pit.

177
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:24,000
I'm okay with gravel pit.

178
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:26,000
Let's do gravel pit.

179
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:28,000
This is the server.

180
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:30,000
Ladies and gents.

181
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:33,000
Head there.

182
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:36,000
Gravel pit.

183
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:38,000
Yeah, dust bowl is a little overplayed.

184
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:40,000
But I love it though.

185
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:42,000
I love dust bowl.

186
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:45,000
That's because I'm an old school TF2 player.

187
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:47,000
I mean, I haven't played since 2007.

188
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:48,000
And I remember that.

189
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:53,000
It used to only be dust bowl, two fort, turbine.

190
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:56,000
Gravel pit.

191
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:57,000
What would the...

192
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:59,000
There was only like two more...

193
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:02,000
There was only six maps when TF2 launched.

194
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:08,000
Two fort, dust bowl, gravel pit, turbine.

195
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:11,000
What would the other two maps?

196
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:13,000
What the hell would the other two maps?

197
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:16,000
Can somebody in the chat throw that out there?

198
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:18,000
Well and...

199
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:19,000
Granary.

200
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:20,000
Right?

201
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:21,000
Those are the only...

202
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:25,000
There was only six that came out at release.

203
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:27,000
Let's go below.

204
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:29,000
Let's go attack eight tonight.

205
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:32,000
I feel like being an attacker.

206
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:33,000
Hmm.

207
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:36,000
No, we're gonna stop with medic.

208
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:40,000
I'm starting with the medic.

209
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:43,000
Alright, let's get the audio good here.

210
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:45,000
Game audio good?

211
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:46,000
Voice audio, is it?

212
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:47,000
We getting up a pod?

213
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:50,000
I'm gonna have to tell.

214
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:53,000
We should begin.

215
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:57,000
Dun dun dun dun dun dun dun dun.

216
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:58,000
Oh yeah.

217
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:00,000
High five, baby.

218
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:02,000
Excellent.

219
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:06,000
Alright, let's push this point, voice.

220
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:09,000
Yeah, if anyone wants to do me, I will accept it.

221
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:13,000
I'm not gonna promise I will win the duel.

222
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:16,000
It's anyone watching the stream, but I will try my best.

223
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:26,000
I got you, I got you, I got you.

224
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:28,000
Follow me, doctor!

225
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:31,000
I'm gonna cover the house, I'm gonna push the cover.

226
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:32,000
We got, we need to...

227
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:33,000
We need this over or what?

228
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:34,000
Are we good?

229
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:37,000
We're good to go?

230
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:38,000
I think we're gonna get this.

231
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:39,000
You know what?

232
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:40,000
I'm gonna go.

233
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:43,000
Not that way.

234
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:45,000
I had to use it.

235
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:47,000
I had to use it.

236
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:48,000
Oh no.

237
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:50,000
Oh no.

238
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:52,000
Oh, I shouldn't have left.

239
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:53,000
That was my bad.

240
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:56,000
I should have ice creamed that up.

241
00:10:56,000 --> 00:11:01,000
Oh boy, I'm gonna die, I'm gonna die, I'm gonna die.

242
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:02,000
J.M.Z.

243
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:04,000
Hole.

244
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:05,000
We're okay.

245
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:08,000
That guy's gonna try and shoot the window.

246
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:09,000
We got it, we got it, we got it.

247
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:11,000
Oh, even that sandwich.

248
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:13,000
Spy, where are you?

249
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:16,000
Bastard, there you are.

250
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:23,000
We gotta get out of here, we gotta get out of here, we gotta get destroyed.

251
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:28,000
Thank you for saving my life.

252
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:31,000
S, I don't wanna say your name, Holland.

253
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:34,000
You're very quiet, you're very quiet.

254
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:35,000
What?

255
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:36,000
What?

256
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:37,000
What?

257
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:38,000
What?

258
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:41,000
They knew I got him.

259
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:46,000
Alright, let's push it.

260
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:48,000
I love your outfit man.

261
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:52,000
I think I said this before last stream, but your outfit is unbelievable.

262
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:56,000
And this is when we...

263
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:58,000
I'm using it.

264
00:11:58,000 --> 00:11:59,000
I'm using it.

265
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:01,000
You know, I'm gonna protect this guy too.

266
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:03,000
Just because, for fun.

267
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:09,000
Oh, a Turk!

268
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:11,000
Oh, it's the guy I'm doing!

269
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:13,000
Oh my god!

270
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:15,000
That's just fine, that's fine.

271
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:16,000
Oh, get away!

272
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:18,000
Oh, damn it.

273
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:22,000
I didn't even know that was the guy I was doing.

274
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:26,000
I just walked up and function in the face.

275
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:29,000
Yeah, if you gotta do it, throw up my way, dude.

276
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:31,000
I will do you.

277
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:35,000
Absent positive, I'll do it.

278
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:44,000
I'm gonna get a...

279
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:48,000
Let's get a...

280
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:50,000
Oh, I have to do it with you.

281
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:52,000
I don't even know if I have any tools.

282
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:54,000
I think I gave them all away.

283
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:58,000
Oh, shh, there we go again.

284
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:02,000
Oh, give me that Uber.

285
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:07,000
We're gonna be able to push this...

286
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:09,000
Right crowbar.

287
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:12,000
See what you got, baby.

288
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:17,000
No, no, no, where are you?

289
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:18,000
Oh, no.

290
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:20,000
Get out of my way!

291
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:25,000
Okay, hi guys, hello!

292
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:27,000
Get away!

293
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:31,000
Damn it!

294
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:36,000
Oh, damn it.

295
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:39,000
Do you see that whole group of people that were running off the stairs?

296
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:43,000
That was terrifying.

297
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:46,000
Good morning, good morning.

298
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:49,000
Dun-dun-dun-dun-dun-dun, good morning.

299
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:52,000
Good morning!

300
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:55,000
People need heels.

301
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:58,000
Oh, Burger Boy, the DUP machine.

302
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:06,000
Oh no, oh no.

303
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:09,000
Two of the people that healed, I need the quick fix.

304
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:12,000
Oh my god, he's coming after me still.

305
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:15,000
Oh my god, how did he get me?

306
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:18,000
Dude, that guy was like in a bubble.

307
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:21,000
He was in a bubble of invincibility right there.

308
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:23,000
You know, I'm going quick fix.

309
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:28,000
After my backpack, if we- oh no, that's right, I unboxed this strange one.

310
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:30,000
Oh god, I unboxed this.

311
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:33,000
I just will put it to the use, right?

312
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:40,000
Let's go scout, I want to be able to run fast.

313
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:43,000
Run, run, run, run, run.

314
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:46,000
Quick fix!

315
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:49,000
Oh yeah, quick fix!

316
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:54,000
Oh you want to get him?

317
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:59,000
No, no, no kill the medic.

318
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:02,000
Come here, run to me.

319
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:04,000
Oh my god, die you bastard.

320
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:09,000
Oh my god dude.

321
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:13,000
How many hits did that take?

322
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:15,000
Alright, I got a new one.

323
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:18,000
Let's push through this.

324
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:22,000
I'm not going to push through this nonsense of the equation.

325
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:30,000
Quick fix, oh what you know about the quick fix, oh my god.

326
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:32,000
Come here, come here.

327
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:34,000
Oh you jumped away from me.

328
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:36,000
What the hell?

329
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:38,000
Holy one.

330
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:41,000
Cool, nice job guys, good game.

331
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:43,000
Good game.

332
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:46,000
I really like the Yogs cast.

333
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:49,000
I don't really watch it to be honest.

334
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:52,000
Yogs cast is kind of like a Minecraft thing, isn't it?

335
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:55,000
Or at least a predominantly Minecraft?

336
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:58,000
See, I have no idea.

337
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:01,000
This is me, I have absolutely no idea.

338
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:06,000
They seem like nice guys, they seem like cool guys.

339
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:10,000
You know, I don't, I'm changing.

340
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:12,000
I want the crit screw.

341
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:16,000
Can I get it charged before?

342
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:22,000
Well, I really, I don't have an affinity on them to be honest.

343
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:25,000
Oh, I can't have vibing.

344
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:32,000
Let's go Virgo boy.

345
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:38,000
Optimus Brogues like Stadda then, like a statue.

346
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:43,000
Mission begins in 10 seconds.

347
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:51,000
All right Virgo boy, you better be ready to unleash hell on the world.

348
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:57,000
After this crit screw, I'm gonna, he's dying over here.

349
00:16:57,000 --> 00:17:01,000
All right Virgo boy.

350
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:05,000
Watch out for Virgo boy.

351
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:08,000
I'm holding onto this.

352
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:11,000
I'll come back to you.

353
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:14,000
Over here Virgo.

354
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:17,000
Oh there's Spy here.

355
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:22,000
Spy here, what do you think down?

356
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:27,000
Am I a fan of Shibuya 142?

357
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:30,000
I love Shibuya 142, he's like a friend of mine.

358
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:33,000
He's like a good bottomine.

359
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:37,000
You are not real.

360
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:40,000
He's still here.

361
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:46,000
Me and I Shibuya 2142 are a roasties.

362
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:48,000
I'm gonna get this.

363
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:50,000
Just shoot a bunch over there.

364
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:55,000
Oh my god, never mind.

365
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:59,000
I do know Star as well.

366
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:06,000
I'm not as close to Star as I am with Shibuya, but I know Star.

367
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:15,000
Speaking of Star, we may actually be doing videos together sometime soon.

368
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:21,000
Sometime very soon.

369
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:24,000
He's a cool guy though.

370
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:26,000
Stimid.

371
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:28,000
Yes, I know Stimid.

372
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:29,000
I know.

373
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:33,000
Pretty much if you can name me like a team portrait through Channel, I probably know them.

374
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:36,000
I probably know who they are and I've probably spoken to them.

375
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:40,000
At least once or twice.

376
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:43,000
Stay alive, Derp.

377
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:45,000
Do you know German 985?

378
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:47,000
No, who's that?

379
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:51,000
He sounds like a real looser.

380
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:54,000
Oh Virgo boy.

381
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:57,000
Get rid of this guy.

382
00:18:57,000 --> 00:19:04,000
He's a pretty cool guy.

383
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:07,000
For its great.

384
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:11,000
Blodges.

385
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:18,000
Do you know.

386
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:20,000
Is that a spy?

387
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:21,000
Probably not.

388
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:22,000
That's a spy.

389
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:23,000
What?

390
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:26,000
Alright, so my brain just exploded.

391
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:30,000
I walked towards that engineer, the real one, and then I turned around.

392
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:33,000
I thought it was him again and I thought it was real, so I got fouled.

393
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:38,000
That was a good spy.

394
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:51,000
Why are we screaming?

395
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:57,000
I don't know.

396
00:19:57,000 --> 00:20:00,000
I don't know all of them.

397
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:04,000
There are probably a few that I've never had a conversation with.

398
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:09,000
But for the most part, I had a conversation with all of them.

399
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:14,000
I think there's a little murder.

400
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:17,000
Alright, that's a spy.

401
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:20,000
Nope, it's just a dump machine, Bird of Boy.

402
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:23,000
I don't stay alive dude.

403
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:24,000
I got you.

404
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:27,000
Oh, the medic chain.

405
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:30,000
Oh my word.

406
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:32,000
I'm getting a little bit of trouble here.

407
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:36,000
Shouldn't be walking out that far.

408
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:41,000
Oh, just give me one more.

409
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:43,000
And...

410
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:44,000
Should I use it?

411
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:45,000
Yes.

412
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:47,000
Oh, everyone died.

413
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:57,000
Oh, crit rockets everywhere.

414
00:20:57,000 --> 00:20:58,000
Spiders.

415
00:20:58,000 --> 00:21:00,000
Oh, I hate spiders.

416
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:01,000
They scare me.

417
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:04,000
Alright, I'm gonna go to...

418
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:05,000
Do I even...

419
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:07,000
I don't think I even have a huntsman.

420
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:08,000
No, I don't.

421
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:09,000
My huntsman's gone.

422
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:10,000
Oh, forget it.

423
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:11,000
Then wait, wait, wait.

424
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:12,000
What the hell was that?

425
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:13,000
What?

426
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:14,000
What?

427
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:17,000
Oh, hey, I'm just the floating sniper hand.

428
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:18,000
There we go.

429
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:21,000
That was weird.

430
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:25,000
Let's go scout.

431
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:28,000
All defaults.

432
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:30,000
Uh, no, I'm alright.

433
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:32,000
Optimus Brent, I'm cool.

434
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:33,000
Not right this second.

435
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:35,000
Maybe after when it's all said and done.

436
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:39,000
But for now, I want to focus on the Zistream.

437
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:42,000
Let's give you a straight-up.

438
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:47,000
Yeah, we'll do it, thanks.

439
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:48,000
You know what I want?

440
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:52,000
I want a strange huntsman.

441
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:55,000
Oh crap.

442
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:57,000
You are still alive.

443
00:21:57,000 --> 00:21:59,000
Is there even a strange huntsman?

444
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:05,000
Can you even get that?

445
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:07,000
Ah, damn it.

446
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:12,000
How much is a strange huntsman?

447
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:15,000
40 keys.

448
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:18,000
It's 40 keys for a strange huntsman.

449
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:19,000
What?

450
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:21,000
Oh my god.

451
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:25,000
What crate do you get it in?

452
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:28,000
What, do you crate number 40?

453
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:29,000
What?

454
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:32,000
Wow, man.

455
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:34,000
Wow, the salvage crate.

456
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:37,000
Oh, it's just a salvage crate.

457
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:39,000
It's one of the rare ones.

458
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:40,000
That's insane.

459
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:43,000
40 keys.

460
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:46,000
If I get a strange huntsman, I know I'm going to keep it.

461
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:51,000
That's crazy.

462
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:55,000
Anybody up here?

463
00:22:55,000 --> 00:22:57,000
Now, what's up?

464
00:22:57,000 --> 00:23:03,000
Millennium boy, exoskeleton bug body.

465
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:06,000
I just landed on his head.

466
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:07,000
No.

467
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:09,000
I got flowed up.

468
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:14,000
I got flowed it up.

469
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:18,000
Sorry, Millennium man.

470
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:19,000
Yeah, it's going to be fun.

471
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:23,000
Well, after this round, we'll change servers.

472
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:24,000
I don't want to use the pistol.

473
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:25,000
Oh, I still have it.

474
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:27,000
I have the critical.

475
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:32,000
Let's put it on.

476
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:34,000
Yeah, I love all the scatterguns.

477
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:35,000
Except for the force of nature.

478
00:23:35,000 --> 00:23:38,000
It's not my forte.

479
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:41,000
I'm not a big fan of it.

480
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:45,000
See if we can't crit some people.

481
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:47,000
Oh, my god.

482
00:23:47,000 --> 00:23:48,000
That was a deathmish.

483
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:51,000
I just wanted to see how many hit markers would just pop up.

484
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:53,000
My name's like, yeah, I don't have my giveaway.

485
00:23:53,000 --> 00:23:54,000
My backpack.

486
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:56,000
I feel the option I have right now.

487
00:23:56,000 --> 00:23:59,000
What happened to my mad bill?

488
00:23:59,000 --> 00:24:00,000
Oh, right.

489
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:02,000
I probably gave that away.

490
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:07,000
Yeah, I gave that away as well.

491
00:24:07,000 --> 00:24:12,000
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

492
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:14,000
All right, let's close this out, boys.

493
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:17,000
End girls, potentially.

494
00:24:17,000 --> 00:24:20,000
All right, I want to get that good couple kills.

495
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:22,000
This thing, Jake.

496
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:24,000
Thank you for Jake.

497
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:26,000
No, that's a death wish.

498
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:28,000
I'll go the other way.

499
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:30,000
I'm going over here.

500
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:32,000
I'm not that I can see.

501
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:34,000
Anyone going to come out of this way?

502
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:35,000
Oh, god.

503
00:24:35,000 --> 00:24:36,000
I don't think that guy.

504
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:38,000
I didn't even see him.

505
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:40,000
Run away.

506
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:42,000
Oh, my god.

507
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:45,000
See, getting stuck just like saved my life right there.

508
00:24:45,000 --> 00:24:49,000
I'm going to get shot right in the back.

509
00:24:49,000 --> 00:24:51,000
Oh, my god.

510
00:24:51,000 --> 00:24:54,000
See, getting stuck just like saved my life right there.

511
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:57,000
I'm going to get shot right in the back.

512
00:24:58,000 --> 00:25:00,000
I want to go shot right in my vinkine.

513
00:25:05,000 --> 00:25:06,000
Oh, crap.

514
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:07,000
Oh, crap.

515
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:14,000
I'm bumping into somebody.

516
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:16,000
I'm bumping into somebody.

517
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:18,000
Yep, there he is.

518
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:20,000
Help me.

519
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:22,000
Ends in 30 seconds.

520
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:23,000
Shit, wow.

521
00:25:23,000 --> 00:25:25,000
The dead ringer.

522
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:31,000
Anybody, anybody?

523
00:25:31,000 --> 00:25:35,000
Oh, nine damage.

524
00:25:35,000 --> 00:25:39,000
Thank god I did nine damage.

525
00:25:39,000 --> 00:25:41,000
Oh, man.

526
00:25:41,000 --> 00:25:43,000
This is bad news.

527
00:25:43,000 --> 00:25:44,000
Bad news right now.

528
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:46,000
What am I thinking?

529
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:49,000
Oh, god.

530
00:25:49,000 --> 00:25:51,000
I tied it up at the very end.

531
00:25:51,000 --> 00:25:53,000
Oh, my god.

532
00:25:53,000 --> 00:25:55,000
Right at the very end, I tied it.

533
00:25:55,000 --> 00:25:56,000
Holy crap.

534
00:25:56,000 --> 00:25:58,000
All right, we did, guys.

535
00:25:58,000 --> 00:26:00,000
We are going to change servers now.

536
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:02,000
So thanks, guys, jumping in this one.

537
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:05,000
It's going to be one.

538
00:26:05,000 --> 00:26:07,000
Damn, damn, damn, damn, damn, damn.

539
00:26:07,000 --> 00:26:10,000
This, I got to clean this milk up.

540
00:26:13,000 --> 00:26:16,000
I got to clean this mad milk up.

541
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:19,000
I got to clean this.

542
00:26:19,000 --> 00:26:22,000
I got to clean оргan.

543
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:25,000
I got to clean it.

544
00:26:25,000 --> 00:26:27,000
I got to clean it.

545
00:26:27,000 --> 00:26:29,000
I got to clean it.

546
00:26:29,000 --> 00:26:31,000
I got to clean it.

547
00:26:31,000 --> 00:26:34,000
I got to clean it.

548
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:37,000
Vyaduct.

549
00:26:37,000 --> 00:26:39,000
No, that's, I don't know where that is.

550
00:26:39,000 --> 00:26:41,000
Five gorge could be cool.

551
00:26:41,000 --> 00:26:42,000
What else we got?

552
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:43,000
Granery.

553
00:26:43,000 --> 00:26:45,000
I might be feeling granery right now.

554
00:26:45,000 --> 00:26:48,000
Granery is, we're doing granery.

555
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:51,000
In the Reddit server apparently.

556
00:26:51,000 --> 00:26:54,000
I'll be that.

557
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:57,000
Here you go.

558
00:26:57,000 --> 00:27:02,000
There's the new server.

559
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:07,000
Granery is one of those maps that you never feel like playing on it.

560
00:27:07,000 --> 00:27:10,000
But once you're actually playing,

561
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:12,000
you're going to be able to play on it.

562
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:14,000
You never feel like playing on it.

563
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:17,000
But once you're actually playing on it, you have a good time.

564
00:27:17,000 --> 00:27:18,000
I don't know why.

565
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:21,000
Every single time I play granery, it's like, oh,

566
00:27:21,000 --> 00:27:23,000
do I want to play granery?

567
00:27:23,000 --> 00:27:24,000
I don't think so.

568
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:29,000
But then when I actually get on it, it's like, oh, this is fun.

569
00:27:29,000 --> 00:27:33,000
Oh, it just changed a well.

570
00:27:33,000 --> 00:27:36,000
Well, that's cool.

571
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:41,000
I feel the same way about well, though, to be honest.

572
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:44,000
All right, let's go.

573
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:45,000
Let's go.

574
00:27:45,000 --> 00:27:48,000
Let's go.

575
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:50,000
Here we go.

576
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:51,000
Here we go.

577
00:27:51,000 --> 00:27:55,000
I'll go red because I was on blue last time.

578
00:27:55,000 --> 00:27:58,000
Maybe not.

579
00:27:58,000 --> 00:27:59,000
Maybe so.

580
00:27:59,000 --> 00:28:00,000
Nope.

581
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:03,000
Let me join red.

582
00:28:03,000 --> 00:28:07,000
This time we're going to play demo.

583
00:28:07,000 --> 00:28:09,000
Default demo, man.

584
00:28:09,000 --> 00:28:14,000
Okay, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, strange lock and load.

585
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:17,000
Almost forgot.

586
00:28:17,000 --> 00:28:20,000
I almost forgot.

587
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:22,000
Mission begins and 30 seconds.

588
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:23,000
Mission begins.

589
00:28:23,000 --> 00:28:24,000
One second.

590
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:25,000
One.

591
00:28:25,000 --> 00:28:27,000
Go.

592
00:28:27,000 --> 00:28:30,000
I don't know.

593
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:31,000
I don't know.

594
00:28:31,000 --> 00:28:37,000
But let any of the men get a better internet.

595
00:28:37,000 --> 00:28:38,000
No, let's see.

596
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:39,000
Can I kill somebody?

597
00:28:39,000 --> 00:28:40,000
Come on.

598
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:41,000
Are you happy?

599
00:28:41,000 --> 00:28:42,000
I'm happy.

600
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:43,000
Thank you.

601
00:28:43,000 --> 00:28:44,000
Oh, man.

602
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:45,000
Oh, man.

603
00:28:45,000 --> 00:28:47,000
Shout out to the men.

604
00:28:47,000 --> 00:28:48,000
One.

605
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:49,000
The belt machine.

606
00:28:49,000 --> 00:28:52,000
Millennium man.

607
00:28:52,000 --> 00:28:57,000
Will I be selling admin on my server?

608
00:28:57,000 --> 00:28:58,000
No.

609
00:28:58,000 --> 00:29:08,000
I plan on just having people be able to play.

610
00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:16,000
And I'm sure that's, you know, if you play there for long enough and you're, you know, a good supporter of the server, I would just give it to you.

611
00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:21,000
You wouldn't have to pay for it.

612
00:29:21,000 --> 00:29:24,000
Save your money.

613
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:26,000
That was a bad jump.

614
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:28,000
Now I'm going to die like instantly.

615
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:33,000
No, no, not OK.

616
00:29:33,000 --> 00:29:35,000
Where is everybody?

617
00:29:35,000 --> 00:29:38,000
Where is everybody?

618
00:29:38,000 --> 00:29:46,000
Nothing in there.

619
00:29:46,000 --> 00:29:47,000
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

620
00:29:47,000 --> 00:29:51,000
He's behind us.

621
00:29:51,000 --> 00:29:52,000
He's dead now.

622
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:55,000
What is that?

623
00:29:55,000 --> 00:30:00,000
Wow.

624
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:02,000
Oh, I thought he was going to walk out the door.

625
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:05,000
It's all right.

626
00:30:05,000 --> 00:30:06,000
Man, here.

627
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:07,000
Oh, no.

628
00:30:07,000 --> 00:30:09,000
Oh, no, what's going on?

629
00:30:09,000 --> 00:30:11,000
No, I'm going to drown.

630
00:30:11,000 --> 00:30:14,000
Oh, my God.

631
00:30:14,000 --> 00:30:18,000
I really thought I was going to drown right there, guys.

632
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:30,000
Oh, come on.

633
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:35,000
Oh, die.

634
00:30:35,000 --> 00:30:37,000
There we go.

635
00:30:37,000 --> 00:30:38,000
Watch out behind us.

636
00:30:38,000 --> 00:30:39,000
Behind us.

637
00:30:39,000 --> 00:30:42,000
See, guys.

638
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:52,000
Oh, God, I got wrecked.

639
00:30:52,000 --> 00:30:54,000
Right when I got over here.

640
00:30:55,000 --> 00:30:57,000
Oh, my God.

641
00:30:57,000 --> 00:31:02,000
I didn't expect this.

642
00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:04,000
Oh, I didn't even look.

643
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:05,000
I should have been looking.

644
00:31:05,000 --> 00:31:08,000
I'm going to die.

645
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:11,000
It's up top, isn't it?

646
00:31:11,000 --> 00:31:15,000
Nice job, guys.

647
00:31:15,000 --> 00:31:16,000
Nice job.

648
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:20,000
You have a little lady.

649
00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:22,000
Cool.

650
00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:25,000
Good job, gentle ladies and gentlemen.

651
00:31:25,000 --> 00:31:26,000
Who's that?

652
00:31:26,000 --> 00:31:27,000
Who is that?

653
00:31:27,000 --> 00:31:34,000
Who am I doing a refreshing up?

654
00:31:34,000 --> 00:31:37,000
Oh, jump.

655
00:31:37,000 --> 00:31:40,000
Mission begins in 30 seconds.

656
00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:44,000
Mission begins in 30 seconds.

657
00:31:44,000 --> 00:31:47,000
We're going across the top.

658
00:31:47,000 --> 00:31:48,000
Oh, my God.

659
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:50,000
Look who it is, ladies and gentlemen.

660
00:31:50,000 --> 00:31:53,000
Burger boy with like a chocolate melted in his mouth.

661
00:31:53,000 --> 00:31:55,000
Oh, what am I doing?

662
00:31:55,000 --> 00:31:56,000
I shouldn't have came this way.

663
00:31:56,000 --> 00:31:57,000
Why is that up here?

664
00:31:57,000 --> 00:31:59,000
Why is that up here?

665
00:31:59,000 --> 00:32:02,000
Who got up here?

666
00:32:02,000 --> 00:32:05,000
How did that happen to someone from the last round?

667
00:32:05,000 --> 00:32:10,000
Three, two, one.

668
00:32:10,000 --> 00:32:13,000
Come here.

669
00:32:13,000 --> 00:32:16,000
Oh, I'm never going to hit him.

670
00:32:16,000 --> 00:32:19,000
Oh, he just jumped into that.

671
00:32:19,000 --> 00:32:21,000
Where's my spray?

672
00:32:21,000 --> 00:32:26,000
I want to spray.

673
00:32:26,000 --> 00:32:29,000
Oh, come on, walk all over this.

674
00:32:29,000 --> 00:32:34,000
Come on, come on.

675
00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:39,000
Oh, let me get it up there.

676
00:32:39,000 --> 00:32:44,000
Oh, well, at least we got it.

677
00:32:44,000 --> 00:32:48,000
That's Pally.

678
00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:53,000
Oh, this way, go, this way, go, this way.

679
00:32:53,000 --> 00:32:54,000
Careful with the spies.

680
00:32:54,000 --> 00:32:55,000
That might be a spy.

681
00:32:55,000 --> 00:32:56,000
I think it was.

682
00:32:56,000 --> 00:32:58,000
Yes, it was.

683
00:32:58,000 --> 00:33:01,000
Cartoons.

684
00:33:01,000 --> 00:33:04,000
These two.

685
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:05,000
Be careful.

686
00:33:05,000 --> 00:33:07,000
We're entering the enemy base.

687
00:33:07,000 --> 00:33:08,000
Oh, man.

688
00:33:08,000 --> 00:33:14,000
We might be like a team scramble.

689
00:33:15,000 --> 00:33:22,000
Oh.

690
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:28,000
Oh boy.

691
00:33:28,000 --> 00:33:33,000
Oh, get out of town.

692
00:33:33,000 --> 00:33:39,000
No, we're damaged.

693
00:33:39,000 --> 00:33:46,000
I thought if I would just be in try-hard mode right there, I could just be quiet.

694
00:33:46,000 --> 00:33:51,000
Bad.

695
00:33:51,000 --> 00:33:56,000
Oh, the teams I guess aren't that bad.

696
00:33:56,000 --> 00:33:59,000
We could probably use the scramble.

697
00:33:59,000 --> 00:34:00,000
Maybe not.

698
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:06,000
We'll find out.

699
00:34:06,000 --> 00:34:16,000
Oh boy.

700
00:34:16,000 --> 00:34:18,000
That's up.

701
00:34:18,000 --> 00:34:20,000
Heavy.

702
00:34:20,000 --> 00:34:24,000
Really not anymore.

703
00:34:24,000 --> 00:34:27,000
I thought I was going to hit him.

704
00:34:27,000 --> 00:34:35,000
It's all about that little area, little corridor.

705
00:34:35,000 --> 00:34:37,000
He didn't get hit by that.

706
00:34:37,000 --> 00:34:43,000
What is up with that?

707
00:34:43,000 --> 00:34:46,000
How can we, we're defending this point right?

708
00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:49,000
Oh my god, we're going to get like four here.

709
00:34:49,000 --> 00:34:51,000
I'm going to die.

710
00:34:51,000 --> 00:34:52,000
I'm going to die.

711
00:34:52,000 --> 00:34:53,000
Help me.

712
00:34:53,000 --> 00:34:54,000
Somebody help me.

713
00:34:54,000 --> 00:34:55,000
Oh, suicide.

714
00:34:55,000 --> 00:34:58,000
I'm going to die.

715
00:34:58,000 --> 00:35:01,000
Damn.

716
00:35:01,000 --> 00:35:04,000
The heavy, baby.

717
00:35:04,000 --> 00:35:08,000
I talked to DJ last night.

718
00:35:08,000 --> 00:35:11,000
He's working on more stuff.

719
00:35:11,000 --> 00:35:13,000
He's a hard work, man.

720
00:35:13,000 --> 00:35:15,000
He's got a lot of cool ideas.

721
00:35:15,000 --> 00:35:18,000
He's working on a lot of stuff.

722
00:35:18,000 --> 00:35:21,000
It's coming.

723
00:35:21,000 --> 00:35:23,000
You're just kidding me.

724
00:35:23,000 --> 00:35:29,000
I thought you were an enemy.

725
00:35:29,000 --> 00:35:30,000
Oh, wow.

726
00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:32,000
Oh no.

727
00:35:32,000 --> 00:35:34,000
Why did I do that?

728
00:35:34,000 --> 00:35:36,000
I got behind everybody.

729
00:35:36,000 --> 00:35:37,000
And no one knew I was there.

730
00:35:37,000 --> 00:35:41,000
What is wrong with me?

731
00:35:41,000 --> 00:35:45,000
What does the matter with me?

732
00:35:45,000 --> 00:35:49,000
If I had just like not been a freak show,

733
00:35:49,000 --> 00:35:56,000
I'd probably would have had a couple of kills right there.

734
00:35:56,000 --> 00:36:03,000
I made it.

735
00:36:03,000 --> 00:36:10,000
Whoa.

736
00:36:10,000 --> 00:36:13,000
Oh, come on.

737
00:36:13,000 --> 00:36:16,000
We're going viral.

738
00:36:16,000 --> 00:36:19,000
Fire with the flare gun.

739
00:36:19,000 --> 00:36:23,000
I have a degree.

740
00:36:23,000 --> 00:36:28,000
You got to use the console to enter the Serb rip.

741
00:36:28,000 --> 00:36:30,000
I think it's the till day key.

742
00:36:30,000 --> 00:36:33,000
You have to enable it.

743
00:36:33,000 --> 00:36:35,000
Hold on a second.

744
00:36:35,000 --> 00:36:41,000
I've got a Pia offline.

745
00:36:41,000 --> 00:36:43,000
Just so I have those notifications.

746
00:36:43,000 --> 00:36:44,000
Stop popping up.

747
00:36:44,000 --> 00:36:48,000
There's nobody wants to see the notifications.

748
00:36:48,000 --> 00:36:52,000
They want to see Team Fortress 2.

749
00:36:52,000 --> 00:36:59,000
I don't know.

750
00:36:59,000 --> 00:37:04,000
I don't know what's going on.

751
00:37:04,000 --> 00:37:05,000
Oh, God.

752
00:37:05,000 --> 00:37:07,000
So much stuff going on.

753
00:37:07,000 --> 00:37:08,000
No, don't die.

754
00:37:08,000 --> 00:37:09,000
I'm trying to save the heavy.

755
00:37:09,000 --> 00:37:12,000
Who got to buy the bus?

756
00:37:12,000 --> 00:37:18,000
Somebody got to get by the bus, I think.

757
00:37:18,000 --> 00:37:19,000
Yeah, this is the till day key.

758
00:37:19,000 --> 00:37:21,000
You want to enable it.

759
00:37:21,000 --> 00:37:22,000
You've got to options.

760
00:37:22,000 --> 00:37:23,000
Go to advanced.

761
00:37:23,000 --> 00:37:26,000
And then enable developer console.

762
00:37:26,000 --> 00:37:28,000
I want that checked.

763
00:37:28,000 --> 00:37:32,000
And once that is checked by default, it is the till day key.

764
00:37:32,000 --> 00:37:33,000
The thing under escape.

765
00:37:33,000 --> 00:37:35,000
And it looks like this.

766
00:37:35,000 --> 00:37:38,000
Then you type in connect space.

767
00:37:38,000 --> 00:37:39,000
Then the IP.

768
00:37:39,000 --> 00:37:40,000
And then enter.

769
00:37:40,000 --> 00:37:42,000
And that's it.

770
00:37:42,000 --> 00:37:46,000
And that's all she wrote.

771
00:37:46,000 --> 00:37:48,000
Massive bus accident.

772
00:37:48,000 --> 00:37:49,000
Got hit by a train.

773
00:37:49,000 --> 00:37:50,000
Oh, my God.

774
00:37:50,000 --> 00:37:53,000
Oh, boy, you're being captured.

775
00:37:53,000 --> 00:37:55,000
This way.

776
00:37:55,000 --> 00:37:58,000
Oh.

777
00:37:58,000 --> 00:38:00,000
No.

778
00:38:00,000 --> 00:38:01,000
Damn it.

779
00:38:01,000 --> 00:38:02,000
Damn it.

780
00:38:02,000 --> 00:38:03,000
Damn it.

781
00:38:03,000 --> 00:38:04,000
Damn it.

782
00:38:04,000 --> 00:38:05,000
Damn it.

783
00:38:05,000 --> 00:38:06,000
Damn it.

784
00:38:06,000 --> 00:38:07,000
Damn it.

785
00:38:07,000 --> 00:38:08,000
Damn it.

786
00:38:08,000 --> 00:38:10,000
Damn it.

787
00:38:10,000 --> 00:38:11,000
I'm going to spell it out.

788
00:38:11,000 --> 00:38:15,000
D-A-M-N-I-T-E.

789
00:38:15,000 --> 00:38:17,000
I have never played TF2 where.

790
00:38:17,000 --> 00:38:19,000
I've heard it is hysterical though.

791
00:38:19,000 --> 00:38:21,000
And I am absolutely willing to try.

792
00:38:21,000 --> 00:38:23,000
No, no, no, no, no, no.

793
00:38:23,000 --> 00:38:25,000
They're pushing us back.

794
00:38:25,000 --> 00:38:27,000
They have pushed us all the way back.

795
00:38:27,000 --> 00:38:29,000
This is not good.

796
00:38:29,000 --> 00:38:31,000
I'm hanging out here.

797
00:38:31,000 --> 00:38:34,000
Time has been added.

798
00:38:34,000 --> 00:38:40,000
TF2 where is like a Wario where mod for team fortress where you get like five seconds to do like a little midi game.

799
00:38:40,000 --> 00:38:42,000
It's very funny.

800
00:38:42,000 --> 00:38:43,000
I've seen videos on it.

801
00:38:43,000 --> 00:38:44,000
It looks really entertaining.

802
00:38:44,000 --> 00:38:52,000
I'll check with them.

803
00:38:52,000 --> 00:38:59,000
Oh, damn it.

804
00:38:59,000 --> 00:39:01,000
Oh, God, it's chaos.

805
00:39:01,000 --> 00:39:02,000
Shoot at me.

806
00:39:02,000 --> 00:39:06,000
Somebody shoot at me with something.

807
00:39:06,000 --> 00:39:08,000
Oh, that was just chaos.

808
00:39:08,000 --> 00:39:10,000
I'm not sure.

809
00:39:10,000 --> 00:39:12,000
I'll at control point is being captured.

810
00:39:12,000 --> 00:39:15,000
Got to move that gear up.

811
00:39:15,000 --> 00:39:19,000
Yeah, I actually own Gary's mod.

812
00:39:19,000 --> 00:39:20,000
I'm not very good at it though.

813
00:39:20,000 --> 00:39:24,000
I know a lot of people in Gary's mod can make ridiculous things.

814
00:39:24,000 --> 00:39:27,000
I'm not one of those people.

815
00:39:27,000 --> 00:39:29,000
Like, oh, I made this boat.

816
00:39:29,000 --> 00:39:30,000
That's actually a car.

817
00:39:30,000 --> 00:39:32,000
That's actually a house.

818
00:39:32,000 --> 00:39:33,000
And it moves.

819
00:39:33,000 --> 00:39:34,000
And these mouths are animated.

820
00:39:34,000 --> 00:39:37,000
I can't do anything like that.

821
00:39:38,000 --> 00:39:39,000
I wish I could.

822
00:39:41,000 --> 00:39:44,000
Oh, my God.

823
00:39:44,000 --> 00:39:48,000
Oh, my God, retreat.

824
00:39:48,000 --> 00:39:49,000
Wow.

825
00:39:49,000 --> 00:39:52,000
No, no, no.

826
00:39:52,000 --> 00:39:55,000
Oh, there's nothing I can do about that.

827
00:39:55,000 --> 00:39:56,000
Damn it.

828
00:39:56,000 --> 00:39:58,000
New server, guys.

829
00:39:58,000 --> 00:40:05,000
We'll do one more new server and then we're going to hop over to Binding of Isaac probably.

830
00:40:05,000 --> 00:40:07,000
Last empty server.

831
00:40:07,000 --> 00:40:10,000
Where can we find you?

832
00:40:10,000 --> 00:40:12,000
Auxiliary operation.

833
00:40:12,000 --> 00:40:14,000
What the hell is that?

834
00:40:14,000 --> 00:40:16,000
1 to 32.

835
00:40:16,000 --> 00:40:18,000
Actually, this one's 1 to 28.

836
00:40:18,000 --> 00:40:19,000
Bad water.

837
00:40:19,000 --> 00:40:22,000
We can end it on bad water.

838
00:40:22,000 --> 00:40:23,000
There you go.

839
00:40:23,000 --> 00:40:26,000
Join that server right now, ladies and gentlemen.

840
00:40:26,000 --> 00:40:31,000
That's the new IP.

841
00:40:31,000 --> 00:40:33,000
I'll post it again.

842
00:40:33,000 --> 00:40:38,000
And there it is again.

843
00:40:38,000 --> 00:40:45,000
Oh, man.

844
00:40:45,000 --> 00:40:47,000
I'll go defense again.

845
00:40:47,000 --> 00:40:50,000
I'm going to go big century engineer.

846
00:40:50,000 --> 00:40:51,000
Oh, man.

847
00:40:51,000 --> 00:40:52,000
This is depressing.

848
00:40:52,000 --> 00:40:55,000
Where's all my stuff?

849
00:40:55,000 --> 00:41:00,000
Where's all my hats?

850
00:41:00,000 --> 00:41:03,000
I can't do this.

851
00:41:03,000 --> 00:41:05,000
I said I have this.

852
00:41:05,000 --> 00:41:09,000
I can look like I can put this on.

853
00:41:09,000 --> 00:41:10,000
Oh, cool.

854
00:41:10,000 --> 00:41:11,000
I don't know I can wear that.

855
00:41:11,000 --> 00:41:12,000
That's awesome.

856
00:41:12,000 --> 00:41:14,000
Hell yeah, I'll wear that.

857
00:41:14,000 --> 00:41:20,000
I'll wear my ring.

858
00:41:20,000 --> 00:41:24,000
Do well, do well.

859
00:41:24,000 --> 00:41:30,000
Let's do it.

860
00:41:30,000 --> 00:41:34,000
Big century engineer.

861
00:41:34,000 --> 00:41:37,000
That built.

862
00:41:37,000 --> 00:41:42,000
Get it to, you know what, just do an intro.

863
00:41:42,000 --> 00:41:43,000
I'm good.

864
00:41:43,000 --> 00:41:48,000
I'd rather have like the Return to Glory.

865
00:41:48,000 --> 00:41:53,000
Appreciate it.

866
00:41:53,000 --> 00:41:58,000
But thank you, though, Brian.

867
00:41:58,000 --> 00:42:00,000
Appreciate that.

868
00:42:00,000 --> 00:42:01,000
Where's it going?

869
00:42:01,000 --> 00:42:05,000
Let's go right here.

870
00:42:05,000 --> 00:42:09,000
It's a pretty safe place usually.

871
00:42:09,000 --> 00:42:10,000
That way.

872
00:42:10,000 --> 00:42:17,000
Now you know what this is going over here.

873
00:42:17,000 --> 00:42:20,000
That's going to be sure.

874
00:42:20,000 --> 00:42:26,000
Oh, yeah, we're on fire.

875
00:42:26,000 --> 00:42:29,000
Hey, Nuckleheads, I'm talking to you.

876
00:42:29,000 --> 00:42:33,000
Oh, what?

877
00:42:33,000 --> 00:42:47,000
That just scared the crap out of me.

878
00:42:47,000 --> 00:42:50,000
I just scared me.

879
00:42:50,000 --> 00:42:53,000
Like I've really got scared by that.

880
00:42:53,000 --> 00:42:58,000
Like it was like, oh, man, I'm sorry, you guys.

881
00:42:58,000 --> 00:43:04,000
If you were in that server and you just got in and you, I really am sorry.

882
00:43:04,000 --> 00:43:08,000
Okay, well, let's do this again.

883
00:43:08,000 --> 00:43:11,000
This one is not.

884
00:43:11,000 --> 00:43:14,000
No, I don't know about there.

885
00:43:14,000 --> 00:43:21,000
Damn, that was dumb.

886
00:43:21,000 --> 00:43:25,000
All right.

887
00:43:25,000 --> 00:43:26,000
Dustball.

888
00:43:26,000 --> 00:43:27,000
No, this one's bad.

889
00:43:27,000 --> 00:43:28,000
What is it?

890
00:43:28,000 --> 00:43:29,000
This bot's here.

891
00:43:29,000 --> 00:43:32,000
So if we start to join this, it'll get rid of the bots, right?

892
00:43:32,000 --> 00:43:37,000
That's usually what happens.

893
00:43:37,000 --> 00:43:38,000
I'm pretty sure that's what happens.

894
00:43:38,000 --> 00:43:42,000
So let's try this one.

895
00:43:43,000 --> 00:43:45,000
Bad water basin.

896
00:43:45,000 --> 00:43:51,000
Hopefully this one doesn't just turn off, instant turn off.

897
00:43:51,000 --> 00:43:58,000
I hope you're enjoying your time because it's about to instant turn off.

898
00:43:58,000 --> 00:44:01,000
All right, I'll stick with this.

899
00:44:01,000 --> 00:44:02,000
I'll stick with this.

900
00:44:02,000 --> 00:44:04,000
Going over here, no.

901
00:44:04,000 --> 00:44:05,000
Oh, you're already over there.

902
00:44:05,000 --> 00:44:06,000
All right, you got that coming.

903
00:44:06,000 --> 00:44:07,000
I'm cool.

904
00:44:07,000 --> 00:44:11,000
I'll stick right there.

905
00:44:12,000 --> 00:44:15,000
Jeremy, why is Burger Boy so fat?

906
00:44:15,000 --> 00:44:17,000
Hey, that's not nice.

907
00:44:17,000 --> 00:44:22,000
That's not a nice thing to say about Burger Boy.

908
00:44:22,000 --> 00:44:30,000
I'll just get the thing again.

909
00:44:30,000 --> 00:44:32,000
This is a bad spot for that.

910
00:44:32,000 --> 00:44:34,000
I don't know why I put that there.

911
00:44:34,000 --> 00:44:37,000
I need to move that eventually.

912
00:44:37,000 --> 00:44:40,000
Somebody's right there, and it's shoot at it.

913
00:44:41,000 --> 00:44:42,000
You know what?

914
00:44:42,000 --> 00:44:43,000
I might move my...

915
00:44:43,000 --> 00:44:44,000
I'm going to move it.

916
00:44:44,000 --> 00:44:46,000
I'm going up here.

917
00:44:46,000 --> 00:44:47,000
I'm going to go over here.

918
00:44:47,000 --> 00:44:51,000
Looks like they're not capping.

919
00:44:51,000 --> 00:44:54,000
Come on, come on, come on, come on.

920
00:44:54,000 --> 00:44:56,000
Oh, dammit, dammit, dammit.

921
00:44:56,000 --> 00:44:57,000
He doesn't have a sapper.

922
00:44:57,000 --> 00:44:58,000
He doesn't have sapper.

923
00:44:58,000 --> 00:45:01,000
Somebody take care of that.

924
00:45:01,000 --> 00:45:02,000
You know what?

925
00:45:02,000 --> 00:45:06,000
I'm going to go up Gonslinger.

926
00:45:06,000 --> 00:45:13,000
You have a feeling that's going to happen a thousand more times.

927
00:45:13,000 --> 00:45:15,000
Man, did you...

928
00:45:15,000 --> 00:45:19,000
And give my dispenser to this guy.

929
00:45:19,000 --> 00:45:21,000
You got to put it over here.

930
00:45:21,000 --> 00:45:24,000
Somebody comes in Hoover Chargers and kills that.

931
00:45:24,000 --> 00:45:26,000
They'll have this backup one.

932
00:45:26,000 --> 00:45:28,000
In case he needs it.

933
00:45:28,000 --> 00:45:35,000
There you go, sir.

934
00:45:35,000 --> 00:45:40,000
Let's go and get some more.

935
00:45:40,000 --> 00:45:42,000
No, I'll be out of that field yet.

936
00:45:42,000 --> 00:45:43,000
I'm going to leave.

937
00:45:43,000 --> 00:45:50,000
Whoops, didn't mean to click.

938
00:45:50,000 --> 00:45:53,000
Oh, what's going on?

939
00:45:53,000 --> 00:45:56,000
What the hell?

940
00:45:56,000 --> 00:45:59,000
I'm going to build it up.

941
00:45:59,000 --> 00:46:02,000
Run away.

942
00:46:02,000 --> 00:46:08,000
Build in the center.

943
00:46:08,000 --> 00:46:10,000
Two mini-centre in the same spot.

944
00:46:10,000 --> 00:46:13,000
That's a double mini-centre.

945
00:46:13,000 --> 00:46:15,000
You're still alive.

946
00:46:15,000 --> 00:46:16,000
Oh, no.

947
00:46:16,000 --> 00:46:18,000
Dammit, I got too many spies.

948
00:46:18,000 --> 00:46:21,000
Too many spies.

949
00:46:21,000 --> 00:46:22,000
Oh, engineer.

950
00:46:22,000 --> 00:46:24,000
I'm not going to play with you.

951
00:46:24,000 --> 00:46:26,000
How about a soldier?

952
00:46:26,000 --> 00:46:30,000
Soldier with the strange Liberty Launcher and the...

953
00:46:30,000 --> 00:46:31,000
Talon's backup.

954
00:46:31,000 --> 00:46:33,000
Why not?

955
00:46:33,000 --> 00:46:34,000
Might as well.

956
00:46:34,000 --> 00:46:37,000
And the strange hats are touching.

957
00:46:37,000 --> 00:46:38,000
Do I want a vintage husband?

958
00:46:38,000 --> 00:46:39,000
I'm all good.

959
00:46:39,000 --> 00:46:40,000
I'll be okay.

960
00:46:40,000 --> 00:46:44,000
Thank you, though.

961
00:46:44,000 --> 00:46:45,000
And rather, like I said before,

962
00:46:45,000 --> 00:46:47,000
rather you guys keep your stuff.

963
00:46:47,000 --> 00:46:49,000
Thanks for the aid.

964
00:46:49,000 --> 00:46:51,000
Because you could use it, too.

965
00:46:51,000 --> 00:46:52,000
What?

966
00:46:52,000 --> 00:46:54,000
Oh my god.

967
00:46:54,000 --> 00:46:55,000
This is fantastic.

968
00:46:55,000 --> 00:46:57,000
I'm dead instantly.

969
00:46:57,000 --> 00:47:02,000
Didn't even see that.

970
00:47:02,000 --> 00:47:04,000
Oh, they're going to win.

971
00:47:04,000 --> 00:47:05,000
No, I don't know.

972
00:47:05,000 --> 00:47:07,000
I want the...

973
00:47:07,000 --> 00:47:09,000
Let's go to shotgun.

974
00:47:09,000 --> 00:47:14,000
Just walk into that.

975
00:47:14,000 --> 00:47:16,000
If I were to have needed any weapon of my choice,

976
00:47:16,000 --> 00:47:17,000
if I would have wanted,

977
00:47:17,000 --> 00:47:18,000
strange huntsmen.

978
00:47:18,000 --> 00:47:19,000
Everyone was just talking about it.

979
00:47:19,000 --> 00:47:20,000
Oh my god.

980
00:47:20,000 --> 00:47:23,000
It's worth like 50 million dollars or something.

981
00:47:23,000 --> 00:47:30,000
For a 500,000 million trillion dollars.

982
00:47:30,000 --> 00:47:32,000
Let's get on a streak here.

983
00:47:32,000 --> 00:47:33,000
What do you say?

984
00:47:33,000 --> 00:47:34,000
What do you say, Jeremy?

985
00:47:34,000 --> 00:47:42,000
Let's get on a streak.

986
00:47:42,000 --> 00:47:47,000
The reserve shooter would have been like a better option.

987
00:47:47,000 --> 00:47:50,000
Be careful.

988
00:47:50,000 --> 00:47:53,000
Be careful here.

989
00:47:53,000 --> 00:47:54,000
Be careful.

990
00:47:54,000 --> 00:47:55,000
Oh boy.

991
00:47:55,000 --> 00:47:56,000
He's in trouble.

992
00:47:56,000 --> 00:47:59,000
Watch out there.

993
00:47:59,000 --> 00:48:04,000
He's trying to fool us.

994
00:48:04,000 --> 00:48:06,000
Oh, it's a losing fight.

995
00:48:06,000 --> 00:48:08,000
It's a losing fight.

996
00:48:08,000 --> 00:48:12,000
Gotta get away.

997
00:48:12,000 --> 00:48:14,000
Oh, come on.

998
00:48:14,000 --> 00:48:16,000
Look at this health.

999
00:48:16,000 --> 00:48:27,000
Should you use your three refined to craft a hat or should you trade it?

1000
00:48:27,000 --> 00:48:29,000
It depends on what hat you want.

1001
00:48:29,000 --> 00:48:31,000
Because if you go into a trading server,

1002
00:48:31,000 --> 00:48:32,000
you can...

1003
00:48:32,000 --> 00:48:34,000
For a lot of...

1004
00:48:34,000 --> 00:48:37,000
A lot of the time, you can get one hat for one refined.

1005
00:48:37,000 --> 00:48:38,000
Like one of those craftable hats.

1006
00:48:38,000 --> 00:48:41,000
It really depends on if you want a just a hat.

1007
00:48:41,000 --> 00:48:44,000
Because you can potentially get like three hats with three refined.

1008
00:48:44,000 --> 00:48:50,000
Or if you want to just make a random one and potentially get one of the new ones.

1009
00:48:50,000 --> 00:48:52,000
I got an email apparently.

1010
00:48:52,000 --> 00:48:54,000
No idea what that is about.

1011
00:48:54,000 --> 00:48:56,000
Can I check that after I die?

1012
00:48:56,000 --> 00:48:59,000
Well...

1013
00:48:59,000 --> 00:49:04,000
He's going up here.

1014
00:49:04,000 --> 00:49:08,000
Oh, that was lucky.

1015
00:49:08,000 --> 00:49:13,000
Anybody in here?

1016
00:49:14,000 --> 00:49:20,000
You're not a spy.

1017
00:49:20,000 --> 00:49:28,000
Oh, my God, there's a sentry.

1018
00:49:28,000 --> 00:49:30,000
Damn it.

1019
00:49:30,000 --> 00:49:34,000
Oh, they're going to get it.

1020
00:49:34,000 --> 00:49:36,000
Gotta get rid of that sentry.

1021
00:49:36,000 --> 00:49:38,000
Even if I die, damn it, damn it, damn it.

1022
00:49:38,000 --> 00:49:39,000
I was standing right there.

1023
00:49:39,000 --> 00:49:41,000
Damn it.

1024
00:49:41,000 --> 00:49:45,000
The difference between dirty and clean items, I really don't know.

1025
00:49:45,000 --> 00:49:47,000
I'm not a real big trader.

1026
00:49:47,000 --> 00:49:51,000
So I'm not really sure how the link goes.

1027
00:49:51,000 --> 00:49:55,000
I think clean is when it doesn't say who crafted it.

1028
00:49:55,000 --> 00:49:57,000
Isn't that what it means?

1029
00:49:57,000 --> 00:50:05,000
Oh, uncraftable, okay.

1030
00:50:05,000 --> 00:50:08,000
Wow.

1031
00:50:08,000 --> 00:50:09,000
I think we're good.

1032
00:50:09,000 --> 00:50:18,000
I think we got it.

1033
00:50:18,000 --> 00:50:19,000
Oh, run.

1034
00:50:19,000 --> 00:50:22,000
I don't have an equalizer.

1035
00:50:22,000 --> 00:50:31,000
I'm a trouble, I need help.

1036
00:50:31,000 --> 00:50:37,000
I'm bumping into a spy too.

1037
00:50:37,000 --> 00:50:47,000
They're going to get it.

1038
00:50:47,000 --> 00:50:51,000
I don't even see what I'm looking back and forth of the chat in the game.

1039
00:50:51,000 --> 00:50:52,000
What had you talked about?

1040
00:50:52,000 --> 00:50:54,000
Did you want to have a German?

1041
00:50:54,000 --> 00:50:55,000
Just read.

1042
00:50:55,000 --> 00:50:58,000
I'm like, wait, what happened?

1043
00:50:58,000 --> 00:51:04,000
I would like it if you guys don't have to give me anything.

1044
00:51:04,000 --> 00:51:06,000
I got plenty of stuff.

1045
00:51:06,000 --> 00:51:08,000
I got plenty of options where I can get things.

1046
00:51:08,000 --> 00:51:10,000
You guys hold on to your items.

1047
00:51:10,000 --> 00:51:11,000
They're your harder items.

1048
00:51:11,000 --> 00:51:14,000
You guys deserve them not being.

1049
00:51:14,000 --> 00:51:17,000
There's a lot of people right there.

1050
00:51:17,000 --> 00:51:20,000
I'm dead.

1051
00:51:20,000 --> 00:51:23,000
I got the help.

1052
00:51:23,000 --> 00:51:25,000
Oh, crit.

1053
00:51:25,000 --> 00:51:28,000
Oh.

1054
00:51:28,000 --> 00:51:30,000
Outside 100, I have a setup video.

1055
00:51:30,000 --> 00:51:36,000
If you go to my YouTube channel and you type in 4,000 subs, I did like a 4,000 subscriber

1056
00:51:36,000 --> 00:51:39,000
thing a long, long time ago.

1057
00:51:39,000 --> 00:51:40,000
And it's a setup video.

1058
00:51:40,000 --> 00:51:43,000
And it's got the same, I got the same computer.

1059
00:51:43,000 --> 00:51:47,000
So I'm probably going to get a new computer at some point in the near future.

1060
00:51:47,000 --> 00:51:54,000
I would assume probably the next couple of months I will get a new computer.

1061
00:51:54,000 --> 00:51:58,000
Well, that's over.

1062
00:52:01,000 --> 00:52:04,000
You failed.

1063
00:52:04,000 --> 00:52:06,000
Alright.

1064
00:52:06,000 --> 00:52:13,000
So I think I'm going to transition open to binding a bison for one life or two lives or something like that.

1065
00:52:13,000 --> 00:52:17,000
We'll see what I do.

1066
00:52:17,000 --> 00:52:22,000
Broom.

1067
00:52:22,000 --> 00:52:24,000
Broom.

1068
00:52:24,000 --> 00:52:27,000
Broom.

1069
00:52:32,000 --> 00:52:38,000
Binding of Isaac is a really weird, really disturbing kind of...

1070
00:52:38,000 --> 00:52:41,000
It's made in Flash, I think.

1071
00:52:41,000 --> 00:52:44,000
But it's a steam game to get its five bucks.

1072
00:52:44,000 --> 00:52:47,000
It's very, very disturbing and very screwed up.

1073
00:52:47,000 --> 00:52:53,000
So I will put that disclaimer out there before I stream it.

1074
00:52:53,000 --> 00:52:56,000
But yeah, thank you guys if you would see her for the TF2.

1075
00:52:56,000 --> 00:52:59,000
Then thank you so much for coming to watching.

1076
00:52:59,000 --> 00:53:02,000
You guys rock and roll.

1077
00:53:02,000 --> 00:53:04,000
And I'll catch you guys probably next time.

1078
00:53:04,000 --> 00:53:08,000
And I'll be getting a face by frying pan.

1079
00:53:08,000 --> 00:53:11,000
Oh.

1080
00:53:12,000 --> 00:53:15,000
No one come over to where I'm at.

1081
00:53:15,000 --> 00:53:17,000
Alright.

1082
00:53:17,000 --> 00:53:23,000
Let's do some binding of Isaac.

1083
00:53:23,000 --> 00:53:26,000
Now hold on to your hats.

1084
00:53:26,000 --> 00:53:28,000
Hold on to your hats.

1085
00:53:28,000 --> 00:53:31,000
Hold on to your seats.

1086
00:53:31,000 --> 00:53:35,000
Let me see if I can stream this.

1087
00:53:35,000 --> 00:53:38,000
Bamp bamp.

1088
00:53:38,000 --> 00:53:41,000
And here are two.

1089
00:53:41,000 --> 00:53:49,000
On the dash, the dashboard.

1090
00:53:49,000 --> 00:53:52,000
Dashboard.

1091
00:53:52,000 --> 00:53:54,000
Playing.

1092
00:53:54,000 --> 00:53:58,000
Binding of Isaac.

1093
00:53:58,000 --> 00:54:05,000
Update.

1094
00:54:05,000 --> 00:54:08,000
Yeah, I got to change my background.

1095
00:54:08,000 --> 00:54:11,000
Actually, let's change my background.

1096
00:54:11,000 --> 00:54:19,000
Because this has been my background for a very long time.

1097
00:54:19,000 --> 00:54:22,000
Let's change the background.

1098
00:54:22,000 --> 00:54:29,000
Alright, so let's do personalize.

1099
00:54:29,000 --> 00:54:33,000
Desktop backgrounds.

1100
00:54:33,000 --> 00:54:38,000
Alright, so do I want like the space needle?

1101
00:54:38,000 --> 00:54:41,000
Oh god, am I breaking the stream?

1102
00:54:41,000 --> 00:54:44,000
Maybe not.

1103
00:54:44,000 --> 00:54:48,000
I think I like the space needle.

1104
00:54:48,000 --> 00:54:53,000
What about the ice one?

1105
00:54:53,000 --> 00:55:00,000
Oh, sweet.

1106
00:55:00,000 --> 00:55:03,000
Oh, what about this one?

1107
00:55:03,000 --> 00:55:06,000
Oh man, this is the one.

1108
00:55:06,000 --> 00:55:09,000
This is the one I'm keeping.

1109
00:55:09,000 --> 00:55:12,000
Look at this thing.

1110
00:55:12,000 --> 00:55:15,000
That thing is beautiful.

1111
00:55:15,000 --> 00:55:18,000
Save changes.

1112
00:55:18,000 --> 00:55:20,000
Gorgeous.

1113
00:55:20,000 --> 00:55:24,000
Gorgeous screen.

1114
00:55:24,000 --> 00:55:27,000
It's like a painting.

1115
00:55:27,000 --> 00:55:35,000
So disclaimer, finding a Isaac is an incredibly messed up, disturbing, crazy, insane game.

1116
00:55:35,000 --> 00:55:38,000
So viewer discretion is advised.

1117
00:55:38,000 --> 00:55:45,000
I'm going to say that before playing, because obviously this game is ridiculous.

1118
00:55:45,000 --> 00:55:48,000
Probably the stream doesn't die.

1119
00:55:48,000 --> 00:55:53,000
I don't think it will.

1120
00:55:53,000 --> 00:55:56,000
Take a look.

1121
00:55:56,000 --> 00:56:01,000
The audio is going to have to come down a little bit.

1122
00:56:01,000 --> 00:56:05,000
It's okay.

1123
00:56:05,000 --> 00:56:08,000
The finding of Isaac.

1124
00:56:08,000 --> 00:56:09,000
Isaac.

1125
00:56:09,000 --> 00:56:18,000
Okay.

1126
00:56:18,000 --> 00:56:19,000
Change this.

1127
00:56:19,000 --> 00:56:22,000
Screen's going to go black.

1128
00:56:22,000 --> 00:56:25,000
Black screen.

1129
00:56:25,000 --> 00:56:28,000
That's screen region.

1130
00:56:28,000 --> 00:56:31,000
Take this.

1131
00:56:31,000 --> 00:56:34,000
And stretch it out.

1132
00:56:34,000 --> 00:56:35,000
Not ready.

1133
00:56:35,000 --> 00:56:44,000
Finding of Isaac.

1134
00:56:44,000 --> 00:56:47,000
So I'm pretty good at this game.

1135
00:56:47,000 --> 00:56:51,000
I've become pretty good at this game.

1136
00:56:51,000 --> 00:56:53,000
I love this game.

1137
00:56:53,000 --> 00:56:55,000
It is so much fun.

1138
00:56:55,000 --> 00:56:57,000
It's just so addicting.

1139
00:56:57,000 --> 00:57:00,000
Go with the cane.

1140
00:57:00,000 --> 00:57:02,000
Cane.

1141
00:57:02,000 --> 00:57:05,000
Got the eye patch.

1142
00:57:05,000 --> 00:57:06,000
Alright.

1143
00:57:06,000 --> 00:57:08,000
Let's do it.

1144
00:57:08,000 --> 00:57:16,000
The reason why I'm playing this again is because the DLC is coming out in the next couple of days, I think.

1145
00:57:16,000 --> 00:57:25,000
Finding of Isaac DLC should be out soon.

1146
00:57:25,000 --> 00:57:27,000
I'll get that bomb.

1147
00:57:27,000 --> 00:57:35,000
For the meantime, I'm going to run around like a psycho.

1148
00:57:35,000 --> 00:57:38,000
So if you like games that are...

1149
00:57:38,000 --> 00:57:40,000
They call these rogue likes.

1150
00:57:40,000 --> 00:57:45,000
Don't they have rogue like dungeon crawlers?

1151
00:57:46,000 --> 00:57:48,000
The real Blizzard 10121.

1152
00:57:48,000 --> 00:57:51,000
How do you become a mod on the stream?

1153
00:57:51,000 --> 00:57:54,000
Usually the mods are people that I...

1154
00:57:54,000 --> 00:57:58,000
That I'm like friends with that I talk to all the time and stuff like that.

1155
00:57:58,000 --> 00:58:02,000
But yeah, I mean, if you've been coming for that long and you know...

1156
00:58:02,000 --> 00:58:05,000
I'll probably set up some type of way to get a mod.

1157
00:58:05,000 --> 00:58:08,000
A way for you to get mod or wait for people to get mod if they want it.

1158
00:58:08,000 --> 00:58:13,000
But it's hard to give mods to people because there's just so many people that would want it.

1159
00:58:13,000 --> 00:58:16,000
So it's very very difficult to say, oh yeah, you can be a mod.

1160
00:58:16,000 --> 00:58:17,000
Sure.

1161
00:58:17,000 --> 00:58:20,000
Oh, triple shot. This is going to be a good game.

1162
00:58:20,000 --> 00:58:23,000
This is going to be a good game.

1163
00:58:23,000 --> 00:58:28,000
It's hard to give up mod specifically because it's just so many people want it.

1164
00:58:28,000 --> 00:58:33,000
So if I were to give it to one person and you know somebody else would be like, well I want mod too.

1165
00:58:33,000 --> 00:58:38,000
And it's like, it's a very tough decision to make.

1166
00:58:38,000 --> 00:58:42,000
So, but eventually I will probably do...

1167
00:58:42,000 --> 00:58:44,000
I will probably do a...

1168
00:58:44,000 --> 00:58:48,000
some type of way to get it. I don't know how though.

1169
00:58:48,000 --> 00:58:52,000
Triple shot is incredible.

1170
00:58:54,000 --> 00:58:57,000
Did triple shot extra damage more tears?

1171
00:58:57,000 --> 00:59:00,000
You're talking about absolute chaos.

1172
00:59:00,000 --> 00:59:06,000
Let me get that bomb and open up the secret room for crying out loud.

1173
00:59:06,000 --> 00:59:08,000
Spreadgun.

1174
00:59:08,000 --> 00:59:10,000
Oh, and now it's the troll bomb.

1175
00:59:11,000 --> 00:59:13,000
That's not cool.

1176
00:59:13,000 --> 00:59:15,000
For fly contest, mod giveaway.

1177
00:59:15,000 --> 00:59:16,000
You know what? I probably...

1178
00:59:16,000 --> 00:59:19,000
You know what? We're going to have to build it.

1179
00:59:19,000 --> 00:59:22,000
I'll do some type of...

1180
00:59:22,000 --> 00:59:25,000
I don't know.

1181
00:59:25,000 --> 00:59:28,000
It's hard.

1182
00:59:28,000 --> 00:59:31,000
I'll tell you one thing, but those of you that better hang out here.

1183
00:59:31,000 --> 00:59:33,000
I'm going to do...

1184
00:59:33,000 --> 00:59:35,000
I'm going to make a video and move this mouse.

1185
00:59:35,000 --> 00:59:38,000
I'm going to do a video on this in the next couple of days.

1186
00:59:38,000 --> 00:59:40,000
Next week's stream.

1187
00:59:40,000 --> 00:59:43,000
It's going to be very, very interesting.

1188
00:59:43,000 --> 00:59:46,000
Because I'm going to do a game show.

1189
00:59:46,000 --> 00:59:48,000
I'm going to...

1190
00:59:48,000 --> 00:59:49,000
I'm going to try and explain this.

1191
00:59:49,000 --> 00:59:54,000
I'm going to buy another 30 or 40 keys

1192
00:59:54,000 --> 00:59:56,000
and get a bunch of crates.

1193
00:59:56,000 --> 00:59:59,000
And what we're going to do is we're going to do a trivia night

1194
00:59:59,000 --> 01:00:03,000
where I have the screen opens on Team Fortress 2

1195
01:00:03,000 --> 01:00:05,000
and hold on, I'm going to die.

1196
01:00:05,000 --> 01:00:07,000
So the screen's open on Team Fortress 2

1197
01:00:07,000 --> 01:00:09,000
like 40 crates with 40 keys.

1198
01:00:09,000 --> 01:00:11,000
And I'm going to ask trivia questions.

1199
01:00:11,000 --> 01:00:13,000
Like, basically, gaming trivia questions.

1200
01:00:13,000 --> 01:00:16,000
It's not going to be all totally Team Fortress though.

1201
01:00:16,000 --> 01:00:19,000
So it might be some other general gaming questions.

1202
01:00:19,000 --> 01:00:22,000
And if you get it right, if you're the first person to get it in the chat,

1203
01:00:22,000 --> 01:00:26,000
then you get to pick which crate you want online.

1204
01:00:26,000 --> 01:00:28,000
And I just thought about that the other day.

1205
01:00:28,000 --> 01:00:30,000
I was like, you know, that would be actually really cool.

1206
01:00:30,000 --> 01:00:32,000
It would be fun.

1207
01:00:32,000 --> 01:00:34,000
So that's the plan for next.

1208
01:00:34,000 --> 01:00:36,000
And I'm going to make a video on this.

1209
01:00:36,000 --> 01:00:38,000
If you're watching this on YouTube and you're like,

1210
01:00:38,000 --> 01:00:40,000
oh, wait, wait, wait, what? I want more details.

1211
01:00:40,000 --> 01:00:43,000
This is going to be a video made about that very, very soon.

1212
01:00:43,000 --> 01:00:47,000
Do, do, do, do, all right? Let's get some more help.

1213
01:00:49,000 --> 01:00:51,000
Yes, you will get what's inside.

1214
01:00:51,000 --> 01:00:53,000
If you get the trivia question correct,

1215
01:00:53,000 --> 01:00:56,000
you can open up whatever's in whatever crate you want.

1216
01:00:56,000 --> 01:00:57,000
You get whatever's in there.

1217
01:00:57,000 --> 01:01:01,000
It doesn't matter if it's a $5 million unusual or paint.

1218
01:01:01,000 --> 01:01:02,000
You're going to get it.

1219
01:01:02,000 --> 01:01:07,000
Oh, no, no, no, no, no, get out of my way.

1220
01:01:07,000 --> 01:01:09,000
I don't want to tie this early.

1221
01:01:09,000 --> 01:01:17,000
Trouble shot.

1222
01:01:17,000 --> 01:01:22,000
Yeah, if you want, if you guys have crates,

1223
01:01:22,000 --> 01:01:24,000
I mean, I know I did a crate.

1224
01:01:24,000 --> 01:01:27,000
People donated a lot to the last one.

1225
01:01:27,000 --> 01:01:30,000
But if you have crates, if you have, you know,

1226
01:01:30,000 --> 01:01:34,000
I'd series 20 and above anything lower than series 20.

1227
01:01:34,000 --> 01:01:38,000
I don't think I would want to leave that alone for now.

1228
01:01:38,000 --> 01:01:40,000
But yeah, it's just a way to involve everybody.

1229
01:01:40,000 --> 01:01:42,000
Because I think that would just be fun, like a trivia night.

1230
01:01:42,000 --> 01:01:44,000
You know what I mean? Like, all right.

1231
01:01:44,000 --> 01:01:47,000
In what level of, like, legend is Zelda.

1232
01:01:47,000 --> 01:01:49,000
Do you like just anything like that?

1233
01:01:49,000 --> 01:01:53,000
Do you find the master saw and just general basic.

1234
01:01:53,000 --> 01:01:56,000
A lot of people would get involved if they're really fun.

1235
01:01:56,000 --> 01:01:59,000
And hopefully somebody gets something cool.

1236
01:01:59,000 --> 01:02:02,000
Oh, it's a lot of what you got.

1237
01:02:02,000 --> 01:02:04,000
Nothing on me.

1238
01:02:04,000 --> 01:02:08,000
You got nothing on me in my triple shot, baby.

1239
01:02:08,000 --> 01:02:12,000
There would be a lot of team fortress questions though.

1240
01:02:12,000 --> 01:02:15,000
Like, oh, I'm going to get a lot of people.

1241
01:02:15,000 --> 01:02:17,000
I'm going to get a lot of people.

1242
01:02:17,000 --> 01:02:19,000
I'm going to get a lot of people.

1243
01:02:19,000 --> 01:02:22,000
There would be a lot of team fortress questions though.

1244
01:02:22,000 --> 01:02:27,000
Like, oh, in what crate can you get a strange Gerradi?

1245
01:02:27,000 --> 01:02:29,000
Oh, I'm going to die.

1246
01:02:29,000 --> 01:02:32,000
I'm like, too busy talking about what I'm doing to my next dream.

1247
01:02:32,000 --> 01:02:35,000
I'm like, don't be paying attention to this one.

1248
01:02:35,000 --> 01:02:36,000
This is hard.

1249
01:02:36,000 --> 01:02:38,000
I have to use it.

1250
01:02:38,000 --> 01:02:41,000
Oh, what am I doing? I didn't have to use that.

1251
01:02:41,000 --> 01:02:43,000
I could have used it in a, whatever.

1252
01:02:43,000 --> 01:02:46,000
Whatever. That's me being a really, really dumb stupid person.

1253
01:02:46,000 --> 01:02:48,000
But you know what?

1254
01:02:48,000 --> 01:02:50,000
At least I can see it over there.

1255
01:02:50,000 --> 01:02:54,000
Let's see if it rooms right there.

1256
01:02:54,000 --> 01:02:58,000
What I need is I need damage up.

1257
01:03:01,000 --> 01:03:03,000
I know. I have a stealth.

1258
01:03:03,000 --> 01:03:06,000
I know. I know.

1259
01:03:06,000 --> 01:03:09,000
I know.

1260
01:03:17,000 --> 01:03:19,000
There you go.

1261
01:03:19,000 --> 01:03:21,000
So it's a music too loud right now.

1262
01:03:21,000 --> 01:03:22,000
I feel like it is.

1263
01:03:22,000 --> 01:03:24,000
Or am I just freaking out?

1264
01:03:24,000 --> 01:03:27,000
No reason.

1265
01:03:27,000 --> 01:03:30,000
Oh, come on.

1266
01:03:30,000 --> 01:03:32,000
Hit him.

1267
01:03:32,000 --> 01:03:36,000
Okay.

1268
01:03:36,000 --> 01:03:39,000
You know, I have headphones on, so it's kind of tough for me to decipher

1269
01:03:39,000 --> 01:03:45,000
how loud something is or not.

1270
01:03:45,000 --> 01:03:50,000
And open up that secret room, baby.

1271
01:03:50,000 --> 01:03:53,000
$3 or $3 pennies, not dogs.

1272
01:03:53,000 --> 01:03:58,000
That's not a total waste of a secret room.

1273
01:03:58,000 --> 01:04:01,000
How do you get the crates to me?

1274
01:04:01,000 --> 01:04:04,000
I'll probably set up some type of way.

1275
01:04:04,000 --> 01:04:06,000
Everybody doesn't have to give them though.

1276
01:04:06,000 --> 01:04:11,000
Because obviously I only need like 30 or 40 of them.

1277
01:04:15,000 --> 01:04:20,000
I want to give you stuff.

1278
01:04:20,000 --> 01:04:23,000
Should you get this game?

1279
01:04:23,000 --> 01:04:29,000
I'm going to 100% absolutely 100 million% say yes, yes, yes, a million times.

1280
01:04:29,000 --> 01:04:32,000
This is an incredibly fun and incredibly different game.

1281
01:04:32,000 --> 01:04:36,000
It's just like a like 17 and up.

1282
01:04:36,000 --> 01:04:41,000
Like if this is this game is not designed for like younger people to play.

1283
01:04:41,000 --> 01:04:46,000
Only because of the incredibly like blasphemous and ridiculous imagery that is associated with it.

1284
01:04:46,000 --> 01:04:52,000
But if you don't care about that then this game is one of the most fun addictive.

1285
01:04:52,000 --> 01:04:55,000
Probably one of the best games I've ever played that's under $10.

1286
01:04:55,000 --> 01:04:57,000
This game is only five bucks.

1287
01:04:57,000 --> 01:05:00,000
This game is five dollars on steam.

1288
01:05:00,000 --> 01:05:07,000
Like yikes, that's insane.

1289
01:05:07,000 --> 01:05:10,000
This was actually supposed to be ported to the 3DS.

1290
01:05:10,000 --> 01:05:15,000
But Nintendo said that's not happening.

1291
01:05:15,000 --> 01:05:22,000
I don't want to comment cause these things.

1292
01:05:22,000 --> 01:05:24,000
Do I even have enough money for anything?

1293
01:05:24,000 --> 01:05:25,000
I don't think so.

1294
01:05:25,000 --> 01:05:27,000
It's not even worth opening this door.

1295
01:05:27,000 --> 01:05:29,000
Not even worth opening the door.

1296
01:05:29,000 --> 01:05:34,000
I don't even have enough money to get anything in there.

1297
01:05:35,000 --> 01:05:37,000
Die!

1298
01:05:39,000 --> 01:05:40,000
Come on, hit him.

1299
01:05:40,000 --> 01:05:43,000
I got the triple shot. Why am I missing so much?

1300
01:05:43,000 --> 01:05:48,000
Yeah and Nintendo said because of religious and blasphemous and just...

1301
01:05:48,000 --> 01:05:53,000
The game is just really very very dark.

1302
01:05:53,000 --> 01:05:55,000
So it is only on steam.

1303
01:05:55,000 --> 01:05:58,000
It's the only place you can get it.

1304
01:05:58,000 --> 01:06:00,000
I don't think it's on Xbox Live.

1305
01:06:00,000 --> 01:06:01,000
Oh look a sun card.

1306
01:06:01,000 --> 01:06:03,000
Might as well like waste it.

1307
01:06:04,000 --> 01:06:07,000
I'll come back to the judgement.

1308
01:06:07,000 --> 01:06:10,000
Oh, what this boss is but?

1309
01:06:10,000 --> 01:06:13,000
Give an eye!

1310
01:06:13,000 --> 01:06:18,000
I'm like tempted to just use the sun card and not have to even fight this guy.

1311
01:06:18,000 --> 01:06:19,000
But you know what?

1312
01:06:19,000 --> 01:06:20,000
I'm not going to do that.

1313
01:06:20,000 --> 01:06:22,000
We will do this the right way.

1314
01:06:28,000 --> 01:06:30,000
I'm trying to get rid of the baby first.

1315
01:06:30,000 --> 01:06:32,000
I don't think I can though.

1316
01:06:33,000 --> 01:06:35,000
Pretty sure you can.

1317
01:06:38,000 --> 01:06:41,000
And he more tears.

1318
01:06:41,000 --> 01:06:44,000
Not shooting fast enough.

1319
01:06:44,000 --> 01:06:46,000
Something from the future I unlocked.

1320
01:06:46,000 --> 01:06:49,000
Some now in the basement.

1321
01:06:49,000 --> 01:06:52,000
Speed up.

1322
01:06:55,000 --> 01:06:57,000
I would use the sun card.

1323
01:06:57,000 --> 01:07:00,000
But honestly it's just...

1324
01:07:00,000 --> 01:07:02,000
It's a...

1325
01:07:02,000 --> 01:07:03,000
Oh crap moment.

1326
01:07:03,000 --> 01:07:04,000
Like I'm going to die.

1327
01:07:04,000 --> 01:07:05,000
I'm going to die.

1328
01:07:05,000 --> 01:07:07,000
Use it.

1329
01:07:07,000 --> 01:07:09,000
I'm not sure you sell bank.

1330
01:07:09,000 --> 01:07:12,000
I will take whatever is in there.

1331
01:07:12,000 --> 01:07:13,000
Take that key.

1332
01:07:13,000 --> 01:07:16,000
Thank you very much.

1333
01:07:18,000 --> 01:07:20,000
How do you play this game?

1334
01:07:20,000 --> 01:07:22,000
It's just with the keyboard.

1335
01:07:22,000 --> 01:07:24,000
And you just go from room to room.

1336
01:07:24,000 --> 01:07:28,000
Clearing out all the monsters just like Legends of Zelda or Star tropics.

1337
01:07:28,000 --> 01:07:32,000
Or other games that are around the same design philosophy.

1338
01:07:32,000 --> 01:07:34,000
Once you kill every single thing in the room,

1339
01:07:34,000 --> 01:07:36,000
I see the top left of the map.

1340
01:07:36,000 --> 01:07:39,000
You can see what rooms are open that you can go to.

1341
01:07:39,000 --> 01:07:40,000
Fight the boss.

1342
01:07:40,000 --> 01:07:41,000
You kill the boss.

1343
01:07:41,000 --> 01:07:42,000
You go on to the next level.

1344
01:07:42,000 --> 01:07:44,000
And if you die, it's over.

1345
01:07:44,000 --> 01:07:46,000
You cannot continue.

1346
01:07:46,000 --> 01:07:47,000
There is no lives.

1347
01:07:47,000 --> 01:07:48,000
There is no continuing.

1348
01:07:48,000 --> 01:07:49,000
You just die.

1349
01:07:49,000 --> 01:07:52,000
And if you start all over again.

1350
01:07:52,000 --> 01:07:56,000
This is going to be a room where I might have to be...

1351
01:07:57,000 --> 01:07:59,000
I just take this nice and slow.

1352
01:07:59,000 --> 01:08:01,000
I might only use the song card.

1353
01:08:01,000 --> 01:08:04,000
I think I've heard of these guys.

1354
01:08:04,000 --> 01:08:06,000
There we go.

1355
01:08:06,000 --> 01:08:07,000
There we go.

1356
01:08:10,000 --> 01:08:14,000
Yeah, they're your big fat red bastard.

1357
01:08:14,000 --> 01:08:16,000
Oh!

1358
01:08:16,000 --> 01:08:19,000
The question is, how am I going to do it?

1359
01:08:19,000 --> 01:08:21,000
I'm going to do it.

1360
01:08:21,000 --> 01:08:24,000
Get the coin and the bomb back.

1361
01:08:24,000 --> 01:08:26,000
Oh!

1362
01:08:28,000 --> 01:08:30,000
Mmm.

1363
01:08:30,000 --> 01:08:31,000
I'll take that.

1364
01:08:31,000 --> 01:08:32,000
Yeah.

1365
01:08:32,000 --> 01:08:34,000
Money, money.

1366
01:08:34,000 --> 01:08:37,000
Lots of money.

1367
01:08:37,000 --> 01:08:42,000
Now if I see an item room, I will open the door.

1368
01:08:42,000 --> 01:08:45,000
Because it will be actually worth it.

1369
01:08:45,000 --> 01:08:46,000
Pills.

1370
01:08:46,000 --> 01:08:47,000
Cain is the best with pills.

1371
01:08:47,000 --> 01:08:48,000
Take them.

1372
01:08:48,000 --> 01:08:51,000
Oh!

1373
01:08:51,000 --> 01:08:53,000
Goddammit.

1374
01:08:54,000 --> 01:08:56,000
If I had only known that.

1375
01:08:56,000 --> 01:08:59,000
I had only known that.

1376
01:08:59,000 --> 01:09:02,000
Blast damage increased.

1377
01:09:02,000 --> 01:09:04,000
Oh, I hate this item.

1378
01:09:04,000 --> 01:09:05,000
It freaks me out.

1379
01:09:05,000 --> 01:09:07,000
Look at my guy.

1380
01:09:07,000 --> 01:09:09,000
That looks really screwed up.

1381
01:09:09,000 --> 01:09:12,000
Ha ha ha.

1382
01:09:15,000 --> 01:09:17,000
Should I go into the mob room?

1383
01:09:17,000 --> 01:09:18,000
I'll do it.

1384
01:09:18,000 --> 01:09:19,000
Why not?

1385
01:09:19,000 --> 01:09:21,000
Oh, more pills.

1386
01:09:21,000 --> 01:09:23,000
Who knows what they are.

1387
01:09:23,000 --> 01:09:25,000
I'm going to use them yet.

1388
01:09:25,000 --> 01:09:29,000
Man, I'm shooting way too slow.

1389
01:09:29,000 --> 01:09:31,000
This is like messing with me.

1390
01:09:31,000 --> 01:09:33,000
Need faster speed.

1391
01:09:33,000 --> 01:09:35,000
Firing speed.

1392
01:09:38,000 --> 01:09:41,000
Die.

1393
01:09:41,000 --> 01:09:42,000
Bad.

1394
01:09:42,000 --> 01:09:45,000
These guys make a really weird noise.

1395
01:09:45,000 --> 01:09:48,000
Oh, if I could just kill them faster.

1396
01:09:49,000 --> 01:09:51,000
Oh, die.

1397
01:09:51,000 --> 01:09:53,000
Oh, come on.

1398
01:09:53,000 --> 01:09:55,000
They don't shoot faster though.

1399
01:09:55,000 --> 01:09:57,000
There we go.

1400
01:09:57,000 --> 01:09:59,000
Oh, come on.

1401
01:09:59,000 --> 01:10:02,000
You freaking bastards.

1402
01:10:02,000 --> 01:10:09,000
Oh, my God.

1403
01:10:09,000 --> 01:10:13,000
Oh, my God.

1404
01:10:13,000 --> 01:10:16,000
Oh, my God.

1405
01:10:16,000 --> 01:10:21,000
There we go.

1406
01:10:21,000 --> 01:10:24,000
Let's see what this is.

1407
01:10:24,000 --> 01:10:29,000
Oh, no.

1408
01:10:29,000 --> 01:10:32,000
Well, that was dumb.

1409
01:10:32,000 --> 01:10:35,000
So I've got one more place and I have the secret room.

1410
01:10:35,000 --> 01:10:36,000
Probably right here.

1411
01:10:36,000 --> 01:10:38,000
Maybe either right here or down.

1412
01:10:38,000 --> 01:10:40,000
Now it's got to be down here.

1413
01:10:40,000 --> 01:10:42,000
Secret room.

1414
01:10:42,000 --> 01:10:43,000
Thank you very much.

1415
01:10:43,000 --> 01:10:45,000
Eggs.

1416
01:10:45,000 --> 01:10:52,000
I will take these eggs.

1417
01:10:52,000 --> 01:10:57,000
Oh, all right.

1418
01:10:57,000 --> 01:10:59,000
Easy as pie.

1419
01:10:59,000 --> 01:11:03,000
These guys are nothing.

1420
01:11:03,000 --> 01:11:05,000
The hanged man.

1421
01:11:05,000 --> 01:11:09,000
This one's kind of not really neat that right now.

1422
01:11:09,000 --> 01:11:14,000
But I will blow up this machine for sure.

1423
01:11:14,000 --> 01:11:17,000
And I'm going to do it with the common cause.

1424
01:11:17,000 --> 01:11:22,000
I don't even know if I can pretend to know.

1425
01:11:22,000 --> 01:11:23,000
The Emperor.

1426
01:11:23,000 --> 01:11:25,000
What does the Emperor do?

1427
01:11:25,000 --> 01:11:27,000
I forget what MLC stealth.

1428
01:11:27,000 --> 01:11:29,000
What does the Emperor do?

1429
01:11:29,000 --> 01:11:30,000
What do I do?

1430
01:11:30,000 --> 01:11:31,000
What does this one do?

1431
01:11:31,000 --> 01:11:34,000
I forget.

1432
01:11:34,000 --> 01:11:36,000
And now he's down.

1433
01:11:36,000 --> 01:11:37,000
Takes you to the boss.

1434
01:11:37,000 --> 01:11:41,000
Okay, I'm absolutely not going to do that.

1435
01:11:41,000 --> 01:11:50,000
I will pick this back up with the Sun card.

1436
01:11:50,000 --> 01:11:51,000
Hmm.

1437
01:11:51,000 --> 01:11:52,000
Don't even.

1438
01:11:52,000 --> 01:11:55,000
I'm not going to try and get it.

1439
01:11:55,000 --> 01:11:59,000
Sticking with the Sun card.

1440
01:11:59,000 --> 01:12:01,000
Oh, my.

1441
01:12:01,000 --> 01:12:03,000
I'm using it.

1442
01:12:03,000 --> 01:12:06,000
That was just, I that would have bad news written all over.

1443
01:12:06,000 --> 01:12:09,000
Okay.

1444
01:12:09,000 --> 01:12:11,000
10 bombs.

1445
01:12:11,000 --> 01:12:12,000
You know, I'm doing it.

1446
01:12:12,000 --> 01:12:13,000
I'm absolutely doing it.

1447
01:12:13,000 --> 01:12:14,000
And I get the key too.

1448
01:12:14,000 --> 01:12:15,000
And I get the heart.

1449
01:12:15,000 --> 01:12:16,000
I'll get it all.

1450
01:12:16,000 --> 01:12:24,000
I'll buy your whole damn store up.

1451
01:12:24,000 --> 01:12:26,000
Take the hanged man.

1452
01:12:26,000 --> 01:12:27,000
Actually, what?

1453
01:12:27,000 --> 01:12:29,000
No, I don't want the Emperor card.

1454
01:12:29,000 --> 01:12:31,000
Well, you know, I will take the Emperor card.

1455
01:12:31,000 --> 01:12:33,000
You know why?

1456
01:12:33,000 --> 01:12:34,000
Cause there's nowhere other rooms to go.

1457
01:12:34,000 --> 01:12:35,000
And let's go!

1458
01:12:35,000 --> 01:12:38,000
Woohoo!

1459
01:12:38,000 --> 01:12:43,000
Versus a fistudah!

1460
01:12:43,000 --> 01:12:44,000
You don't blow up.

1461
01:12:44,000 --> 01:12:47,000
I'm using, I'm going to use these bombs on them.

1462
01:12:47,000 --> 01:12:51,000
Actually, no, that's not a good idea.

1463
01:12:51,000 --> 01:12:54,000
I'm going to be in a lot of trouble because I'm shooting way too slow.

1464
01:12:54,000 --> 01:13:01,000
This is way too slow, Vishal.

1465
01:13:01,000 --> 01:13:07,000
God.

1466
01:13:07,000 --> 01:13:08,000
At least I did that.

1467
01:13:08,000 --> 01:13:09,000
Okay.

1468
01:13:09,000 --> 01:13:17,000
Now I'll get out of my way.

1469
01:13:17,000 --> 01:13:19,000
I just saw what you said.

1470
01:13:19,000 --> 01:13:20,000
Blizzard.

1471
01:13:20,000 --> 01:13:28,000
I just don't want to die, so I'll address it in a second.

1472
01:13:28,000 --> 01:13:30,000
And out of my face.

1473
01:13:30,000 --> 01:13:31,000
Okay.

1474
01:13:31,000 --> 01:13:54,000
I don't have Gotham City in Posterous, but I own Sirius Sam III.

1475
01:13:54,000 --> 01:13:55,000
I do not have Gotham City in Posterous.

1476
01:13:55,000 --> 01:14:00,000
I keep hearing it's fun though.

1477
01:14:00,000 --> 01:14:02,000
Okay, for now it's my name.

1478
01:14:02,000 --> 01:14:06,000
XXX, Latha1, XXX.

1479
01:14:06,000 --> 01:14:15,000
I even came close.

1480
01:14:15,000 --> 01:14:21,000
Oh come on, get out of my face.

1481
01:14:21,000 --> 01:14:22,000
At least I got faster tears.

1482
01:14:22,000 --> 01:14:25,000
This is way better.

1483
01:14:25,000 --> 01:14:27,000
My keyboard's getting stuck.

1484
01:14:27,000 --> 01:14:34,000
But I've heard nothing but good things about Gotham City in Posterous.

1485
01:14:34,000 --> 01:14:37,000
So I heard when it launched they had a lot of problems.

1486
01:14:37,000 --> 01:14:48,000
And I think it still has connection problems, directly if I'm wrong, but I remember people talking about that being like I can't even play the game.

1487
01:14:48,000 --> 01:14:55,000
Open, Sesame.

1488
01:14:55,000 --> 01:14:57,000
All right, let me read the chat.

1489
01:14:57,000 --> 01:14:58,000
Somebody had said something.

1490
01:14:58,000 --> 01:15:00,000
Will you be doing playthrough board lengths too?

1491
01:15:00,000 --> 01:15:01,000
I will probably.

1492
01:15:01,000 --> 01:15:04,000
I mean that game's not coming up for a very long time though.

1493
01:15:04,000 --> 01:15:06,000
I think September, right?

1494
01:15:06,000 --> 01:15:08,000
So I'm not sure exactly who I'll play with.

1495
01:15:08,000 --> 01:15:10,000
I have no idea.

1496
01:15:10,000 --> 01:15:18,000
But yes, I'm assuming I will play.

1497
01:15:18,000 --> 01:15:20,000
Where's the DLC for this game?

1498
01:15:20,000 --> 01:15:24,000
Talking about new releases, why don't we get the wrath of the lamb?

1499
01:15:24,000 --> 01:15:28,000
Whatever it's called, the DLC.

1500
01:15:28,000 --> 01:15:30,000
Oh my god, you know what?

1501
01:15:30,000 --> 01:15:31,000
Eat bomb.

1502
01:15:31,000 --> 01:15:34,000
Eat bomb.

1503
01:15:34,000 --> 01:15:37,000
Oh!

1504
01:15:37,000 --> 01:15:38,000
Oh!

1505
01:15:38,000 --> 01:15:43,000
I used to come a Kazian and it killed me.

1506
01:15:43,000 --> 01:15:45,000
I hit the space bar and it...

1507
01:15:45,000 --> 01:15:49,000
Oh my god.

1508
01:15:49,000 --> 01:15:54,000
Dude, I accidentally hit the space bar and it killed me.

1509
01:15:54,000 --> 01:15:57,000
I can't believe I had the stupid item.

1510
01:15:57,000 --> 01:15:59,000
I cannot believe it.

1511
01:15:59,000 --> 01:16:02,000
I am so mad right now.

1512
01:16:02,000 --> 01:16:05,000
I could put my fist through the screen.

1513
01:16:05,000 --> 01:16:07,000
Like what?

1514
01:16:07,000 --> 01:16:12,000
My finger happened to slip over the space bar and touch it.

1515
01:16:12,000 --> 01:16:14,000
I can't believe it.

1516
01:16:14,000 --> 01:16:16,000
I can't believe it.

1517
01:16:16,000 --> 01:16:18,000
I can't believe it.

1518
01:16:18,000 --> 01:16:19,000
Oh!

1519
01:16:19,000 --> 01:16:20,000
I went like this.

1520
01:16:20,000 --> 01:16:21,000
Oh, sorry, hit space.

1521
01:16:21,000 --> 01:16:22,000
Oh god, damn.

1522
01:16:22,000 --> 01:16:25,000
That was a good run, too.

1523
01:16:25,000 --> 01:16:29,000
I was doing fine.

1524
01:16:29,000 --> 01:16:32,000
Alright, it's time for quap.

1525
01:16:32,000 --> 01:16:36,000
I come on.

1526
01:16:36,000 --> 01:16:40,000
I am so upset right now.

1527
01:16:40,000 --> 01:16:44,000
Freaking internet connection.

1528
01:16:45,000 --> 01:16:50,000
Freaking internet connection.

1529
01:16:50,000 --> 01:16:53,000
It's time for quap.

1530
01:16:53,000 --> 01:16:55,000
That's just...

1531
01:16:55,000 --> 01:16:57,000
I can't believe it.

1532
01:16:57,000 --> 01:16:59,000
I am sitting there doing...

1533
01:16:59,000 --> 01:17:02,000
I am running through Viningov Isaac without a problem.

1534
01:17:02,000 --> 01:17:05,000
And I hit the space bar because I have the Dan Kamikaze.

1535
01:17:05,000 --> 01:17:07,000
Well, we are just going to kill you.

1536
01:17:07,000 --> 01:17:10,000
I don't even pick that item up.

1537
01:17:10,000 --> 01:17:13,000
What a worthless item.

1538
01:17:13,000 --> 01:17:22,000
Well, you know, whatever.

1539
01:17:22,000 --> 01:17:24,000
It was bound to happen.

1540
01:17:24,000 --> 01:17:27,000
It was absolutely bound to happen.

1541
01:17:27,000 --> 01:17:30,000
That dat rage.

1542
01:17:30,000 --> 01:17:34,000
Let's do a new window.

1543
01:17:34,000 --> 01:17:35,000
Oh god.

1544
01:17:35,000 --> 01:17:36,000
Oh, so long a second.

1545
01:17:36,000 --> 01:17:39,000
Whoopsadaisy.

1546
01:17:39,000 --> 01:17:42,000
Add screen region.

1547
01:17:43,000 --> 01:17:45,000
Man, here it is.

1548
01:17:45,000 --> 01:17:50,000
Quap, quap, quap, quap.

1549
01:17:50,000 --> 01:17:55,000
Quap.

1550
01:17:55,000 --> 01:17:57,000
Oh, I am still mad about that.

1551
01:17:57,000 --> 01:18:01,000
I am still upset about that.

1552
01:18:01,000 --> 01:18:03,000
Alright, we are going to have another quaps on.

1553
01:18:03,000 --> 01:18:05,000
Let's see if I can get a quaps on.

1554
01:18:05,000 --> 01:18:09,000
The only way I play this game is if I can do a quaps on.

1555
01:18:09,000 --> 01:18:12,000
See if we go ready.

1556
01:18:12,000 --> 01:18:18,000
Plank clock.

1557
01:18:18,000 --> 01:18:20,000
Plank clock.

1558
01:18:20,000 --> 01:18:23,000
Plank clock.

1559
01:18:23,000 --> 01:18:26,000
Quap is the only game we play.

1560
01:18:26,000 --> 01:18:29,000
When we play every day to date.

1561
01:18:29,000 --> 01:18:32,000
We got a quap, quap, quap, quap, quap, quap.

1562
01:18:32,000 --> 01:18:35,000
We got a crown to quap with a slop and a block.

1563
01:18:35,000 --> 01:18:38,000
It sucks.

1564
01:18:38,000 --> 01:18:39,000
It sucks.

1565
01:18:39,000 --> 01:18:42,000
Alright, we will do another one.

1566
01:18:42,000 --> 01:18:44,000
Okay, it is going to start.

1567
01:18:44,000 --> 01:18:46,000
It is going to start like this.

1568
01:18:46,000 --> 01:18:55,000
Quap is the only game you play.

1569
01:18:55,000 --> 01:19:00,000
When you want to play every single day to snug.

1570
01:19:00,000 --> 01:19:03,000
You got a snug.

1571
01:19:03,000 --> 01:19:08,000
The only time you play you got to say quap is the only game you play.

1572
01:19:08,000 --> 01:19:13,000
When you snug stretched out.

1573
01:19:13,000 --> 01:19:17,000
And I can't even move.

1574
01:19:17,000 --> 01:19:19,000
I can't even move today.

1575
01:19:19,000 --> 01:19:21,000
But ness the way we say today.

1576
01:19:21,000 --> 01:19:24,000
We pray we got a new disguise.

1577
01:19:24,000 --> 01:19:28,000
My mind is like all over the place right now.

1578
01:19:28,000 --> 01:19:33,000
Like looking at this guy's legs, it is freaking me out.

1579
01:19:33,000 --> 01:19:38,000
Alright, I got to get past 15 meters.

1580
01:19:38,000 --> 01:19:45,000
Dead, dead, dead, dead, dead, dead, dead, dead, dead, dead, dead, sluck, sluck, sluck, sluck, sluck.

1581
01:19:45,000 --> 01:19:48,000
Alright, I got past 10.

1582
01:19:48,000 --> 01:19:50,000
I got to get past 15.

1583
01:19:50,000 --> 01:19:52,000
Oh yeah, baby.

1584
01:19:52,000 --> 01:19:55,000
What do you know about that?

1585
01:19:55,000 --> 01:19:58,000
Oh my god.

1586
01:19:58,000 --> 01:20:00,000
Oh my god.

1587
01:20:00,000 --> 01:20:01,000
Oh my god.

1588
01:20:01,000 --> 01:20:04,000
I just was doing it.

1589
01:20:04,000 --> 01:20:06,000
I was doing it guys.

1590
01:20:06,000 --> 01:20:08,000
I was just doing it.

1591
01:20:08,000 --> 01:20:10,000
Now we're doing it.

1592
01:20:10,000 --> 01:20:11,000
Now we're doing it.

1593
01:20:11,000 --> 01:20:12,000
Oh I got it.

1594
01:20:12,000 --> 01:20:13,000
I figured it out.

1595
01:20:13,000 --> 01:20:14,000
I figured it out.

1596
01:20:14,000 --> 01:20:15,000
Quap.

1597
01:20:15,000 --> 01:20:18,000
I figured it out how to play quap.

1598
01:20:18,000 --> 01:20:20,000
Alright, last try.

1599
01:20:20,000 --> 01:20:21,000
Last try.

1600
01:20:21,000 --> 01:20:23,000
Come on, I got to get back into that.

1601
01:20:23,000 --> 01:20:24,000
I had it.

1602
01:20:24,000 --> 01:20:25,000
I was running.

1603
01:20:25,000 --> 01:20:27,000
I was legitimately sprinting.

1604
01:20:27,000 --> 01:20:30,000
So bitch.

1605
01:20:30,000 --> 01:20:32,000
I strange love.

1606
01:20:32,000 --> 01:20:38,000
Strange love 23.

1607
01:20:38,000 --> 01:20:42,000
Come on, you slug bastard.

1608
01:20:42,000 --> 01:20:46,000
Alright, if I get by 10, I'm good.

1609
01:20:46,000 --> 01:20:47,000
Nope.

1610
01:20:47,000 --> 01:20:49,000
Okay, whatever.

1611
01:20:49,000 --> 01:20:51,000
Oh, that's going to be it guys.

1612
01:20:51,000 --> 01:20:53,000
That's going to be the end of the stream.

1613
01:20:53,000 --> 01:20:54,000
Nobody dreamed.

1614
01:20:54,000 --> 01:20:55,000
Dream of a dream.

1615
01:20:55,000 --> 01:20:56,000
Dream of a dream stream.

1616
01:20:56,000 --> 01:20:57,000
We got to go.

1617
01:20:57,000 --> 01:20:58,000
Go.

1618
01:20:58,000 --> 01:21:00,000
That's the end of the stream.

1619
01:21:00,000 --> 01:21:02,000
Thank you for coming to the stream.

1620
01:21:02,000 --> 01:21:06,000
I hope you enjoyed the time with me on the stream.

1621
01:21:06,000 --> 01:21:09,000
Now we got to slug one more time to say goodbye.

1622
01:21:09,000 --> 01:21:10,000
Thank you.

1623
01:21:10,000 --> 01:21:11,000
Thank you.

1624
01:21:11,000 --> 01:21:12,000
Everybody.

1625
01:21:12,000 --> 01:21:15,000
See you later guys.

1626
01:21:15,000 --> 01:21:18,000
Go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go.

1627
01:21:19,000 --> 01:21:21,000
Yeah, that's it.

1628
01:21:21,000 --> 01:21:23,000
Alright, ladies and girmes.

1629
01:21:23,000 --> 01:21:25,000
I'll see you guys later.

1630
01:21:25,000 --> 01:21:27,000
Thanks for coming out.

1631
01:21:27,000 --> 01:21:29,000
All over 200 of you guys still here.

1632
01:21:29,000 --> 01:21:30,000
You guys are amazing.

1633
01:21:30,000 --> 01:21:32,000
Thank you so much.

1634
01:21:32,000 --> 01:21:34,000
I'll catch you guys later guys.

1635
01:21:34,000 --> 01:21:36,000
Peace and oh, I forgot to mention.

1636
01:21:36,000 --> 01:21:39,000
Grandpa is going to be...

1637
01:21:39,000 --> 01:21:42,000
It's going to be on Machinima Respawn in like 20 minutes.

1638
01:21:42,000 --> 01:21:45,000
So if you want to see the new Grandpa trailer,

1639
01:21:45,000 --> 01:21:46,000
it's pretty ridiculous.

1640
01:21:46,000 --> 01:21:48,000
It's going to be there in like 25 minutes.

1641
01:21:48,000 --> 01:21:50,000
So Machinima Respawn 20 minutes.

1642
01:21:50,000 --> 01:21:53,000
And yeah, thanks so much guys.

1643
01:21:53,000 --> 01:21:55,000
I'll see you all later.

1644
01:21:55,000 --> 01:21:56,000
And take care.

1645
01:21:56,000 --> 01:21:57,000
Everybody.
