1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000

00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:27,000

00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:32,000
You was making funny you you thought we you thought we weren't coming back

9
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:37,000
When I see something like that I see somebody tell you know he never comes back

10
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:39,000
We're back, okay

11
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:44,000

Maybe these guys will play

13
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:49,000
Oh

14
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:52,000
Invasion is so like three days ago

15
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:55,000
I

16
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:58,000
Have a little bit of fun, man

17
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:02,000
That's all about 20 more hours and Victor friend

18
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:09,000
I'm still transmuted remember that's bad for your street. We're the worst streamer. I hey, I

19
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:12,000
Never said I was the best streamer today

20
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:20,000
Did you up your bit rate yes, and it was fine, right? I think so yeah

21
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:25,000
He doesn't even know he thinks I remember from what I can recall

22
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:31,000
Because that stream I did 10 minutes ago is a fucking blur

23
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:41,000
Shit

24
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:44,000
Was your favorite character in TF2

25
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:47,000
Engineer

26
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:50,000
Not the scout who you look like him

27
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:57,000
Scouts from Boston, German scout. No stars the scout Germans the soldier. Why do it the wrong way?

28
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:02,000
Does this count as the second stream this week?

29
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:08,000
Yeah, see this is two and one day come on

30
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:11,000
It's a lot

31
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:16,000
And a lot of you said of that recording studio

32
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:21,000
God damn it

33
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:26,000
Fucking pistol me

34
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:35,000
How does this map you this is the king of the hill map?

35
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:38,000
Which one of cough probe

36
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:42,000
I think I'm only I think I only played on this map for like two minutes

37
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:46,000
Where's there there's the spawns in their

38
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:51,000
respective corners because that guy was all the way over here. I didn't expect to see a scout back here

39
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:57,000
That's the map with engineers on it. Oh, well, that's good enough

40
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:11,000
I got this you're right there was a century told you

41
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:23,000
I'm gonna stay down

42
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:29,000
Why is the engineer your favorite German I think he's the best character

43
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:32,000
What just hit myself that was done

44
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:35,000
Because he ate yourself

45
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:39,000
I think he I don't know he's just like for some reason to think he's the most interesting

46
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:43,000
Well, like the characters in the game spy is also really interesting to

47
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:48,000
Ask your questions ease

48
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:52,000
Yeah, you haven't you haven't talked about this in a while. Yeah, you haven't seemed to really care

49
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:55,000

51
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:04,000
Yeah, I don't know bastion just seems I

52
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:10,000
Like the easy sentient robot that is very ambiguous and let's go easy

53
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:16,000
You like smart guys, huh, German bastion bastions like

54
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:21,000
Well, they did smart the spy smart national season the robot

55
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:27,000
Who's your favorite world of work craft character and don't say the guy that's the boss guy?

56
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:29,000
I was gonna say I'm

00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:37,000
Never mind under the answer I'm gonna say it. No, oh, he's gonna say a car. Yeah, Jack in my car

58
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:43,000

61
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:04,000
For beer

62
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:06,000
No

63
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:08,000
Time to reap no

64
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:13,000
Maybe I don't know Hanzo's kind of cool

65
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:18,000
You're getting your buddies worth for that stock ambulance ambulance, what a Jarcha?

66
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:24,000
Yeah, oh, that's this neighbor that wasn't cheap

67
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:29,000
We filmed his neighbor dying I'm there you

68
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:40,000
Come on

69
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:50,000
Here oh

70
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:53,000
I'm healthy

71
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:57,000
Dr. Boom

72
00:05:57,000 --> 00:06:02,000
Dr. Boom a law Dr. Boom a low-well credited in my movie. Oh

73
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:05,000
Yeah, you did do that then

74
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:11,000
But you're for a quest the dumbest joke ever made the end of the let's address that the amount of people not that but

75
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:15,000
The amount of people I thought that that I should have shot that

76
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:22,000
The amount of people I thought that that was like real oh my god

77
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:26,000
He filmed like an ambulance outside of his house. What is he doing?

78
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:30,000
Well, that's that was the stock footage

79
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:37,000
Wasn't wasn't me filming that yeah, you know you died

80
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:48,000
I really do like missed contracts

81
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:50,000
I

82
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:56,000
Miss like having something to do get every time I walk out of this fucking spawn. There's another person here to kill me

83
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:03,000
This is walk out was spawned and get attacked at the game

84
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:08,000
Cough pro almost like the enemies come back after you shoot them well, they're at the spawn

85
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:13,000
Like every time I go around this corner there's a person here

86
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:20,000
I

87
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:36,000
Would adore Jerma being taken by ambulance as a running joke I think that person wants you to be injured

88
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:40,000
Or an over I might not ever do it again

89
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:43,000
They'll do it again

90
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:47,000
Who knows that funny joke I did back four years ago

91
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:51,000
We're doing it again. I'm gonna buy her said that

92
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:55,000
constantly

93
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:58,000
Never out of those words. You said it five minutes ago

94
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:03,000
What actually doesn't like anyone

95
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:08,000
You get in a group call with Ashley. I just want to start shit

96
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:16,000
All right, well, it's over just like the outside my mentor

97
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:22,000
Shit, I just kneeled on here for a

98
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:30,000
Secretly count Chocula goodby

99
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:43,000
Oh, I got only strange knives shit. I forgot I had all the strange knives

100
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:51,000
That's just like scared me. Yeah, I did another Victor Ranner no demons holes

101
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:55,000
That's so weird

102
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:02,000
Did we do it the one time with all those hexes on them? That's when the David's will talk that

103
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:06,000
Maybe that doesn't crease drops

104
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:11,000
Probably it Derma, what's your opinion on them?

105
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:16,000
On what

106
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:19,000
molasses on

107
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:22,000
on

108
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:26,000
Coffee what like like on cheesecrumb cake

109
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:32,000
What about she's crumb cake what's your opinion that's actually pretty good?

110
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:35,000
Actually, can you get me some of that?

111
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:38,000
Didn't make it for you once oh

112
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:42,000
I don't have a memory of making it for you

113
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:50,000
I think it's end to me is not Edmunds and I don't know I just eat it. I'm gonna come over here. What the hell?

114
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:09,000
Like a memory is making a crumb cake and well to make a crumb cake. Oh shit. Oh

115
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:11,000
I didn't have anything wrote it in damn it. What the hell?

116
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:18,000
Well, I think you might have made a crumb cake, but not a cheese crumb cake. So I always I wish I had auto reload on but

117
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:21,000
It distracts me

118
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:23,000
It always distracts the hell out of me

119
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:29,000
I agree

120
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:35,000
Do you use auto reload? No, and if I do I turn a view models off didn't you used to long time ago?

121
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:38,000
Yeah, and I turned view models off

122
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:47,000
You claim I'm being Pac-Man for Halloween again

123
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:51,000
Dude I

124
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:55,000
That post for all I do is wine

125
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:01,000
No, I had Halloween this year. I'm not even I don't know

126
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:08,000
Dude, I really want to have a Halloween video, but are you gonna make that Halloween video you were planning on doing?

127
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:15,000
I don't know potentially maybe I'm planning on doing the next couple of days. I'm not to look into if that's even remotely interesting

128
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:25,000
But that has been the plan I've had for the last year. Fuck it. Someone else will kill him so

129
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:36,000
You know when you just when there's a game and you mean to play it and you don't get around to it and it turns out rates is bad

130
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:41,000
I

131
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:46,000
Made plenty of videos where I go. I don't like that wasn't good. I don't want well. No, I mean like

132
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:49,000
When you're gonna play like you you have a game

133
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:54,000
You know you're gonna play the game and like oh yeah, I probably make a video on that and then you finally actually play it

134
00:11:54,000 --> 00:12:01,000
And it's just it's just awful like rake like I waited three or four months to play rake and it just

135
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:05,000
Wasn't into it

136
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:09,000
Maybe I should just play it from the start

137
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:15,000
How many how many hours did you how long did you play rake for?

138
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:21,000
Maybe an hour and a half I mean you can kind of tell what the whole game is pretty easily

139
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:30,000
Medic I think I can't even get out of the fucking area

140
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:37,000
We seriously this locked in what that book

141
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:51,000
I'm ready to get him the soldiers just standing over here

142
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:55,000
Hey, man, hi, dude

143
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:04,000
Did you get my message there?

144
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:11,000
No, I can't pause the game and I'm I'm in spider world again. I don't know why I'm doing this again

145
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:15,000
Find somebody to do this to I need an invite cuz my internet job for a second

146
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:18,000
Let me read

147
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:21,000
We have oh boy

148
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:28,000
We don't have any classes I can really give this to well, okay, it looks like I can give it to this pyro

149
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:32,000
Jeremy should bring back scare Saturdays man

150
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:37,000
That was hilarious because you would get genuinely scared haha

151
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:40,000
Scary Saturdays

152
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:42,000

153
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:46,000
Seriously though playing rake today. I fucking flipped out. I think you might have heard me scream

154
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:49,000
It was a genuine like who seriously are you fucking kidding me scream?

155
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:56,000
The jump scare dude kind of used your screams now. I know I didn't expect rake to be like a spooky game

156
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:58,000
I thought it was a goofy ha ha look at this

157
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:05,000
Wasn't it wasn't goofy it was scary dude. I can just let go about my day and not notice you screaming

158
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:07,000
That's how common it is get on the point

159
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:12,000
And see me

160
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:16,000
Get over here. It's up on the point with me. Yes. Nice job

161
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:25,000
I'm not like matched. I'm not like does other streamers items scream and

162
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:35,000
Dude I used to like roller coasters because they were the only place like in public where you could legit scream and you wouldn't be judged

163
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:38,000
concerts

164
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:40,000
Yeah, you can stream it a concert too

165
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:42,000
What?

166
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:46,000
Go watch beeps. I'm just shaking so violently right now. I

167
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:49,000
Would be the listen at concerts because I was polite

168
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:53,000
Who the hell is Ashley?

169
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:55,000
Who the hell is that?

170
00:14:57,000 --> 00:14:59,000
Nice

171
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:02,000
Who the heck

172
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:06,000
Stars to screams like the three times a stream

173
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:14,000
You know I actually have noticed something about you do you do a lot of screaming I do you do scream

174
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:16,000
Don't I've become a scrimmer?

175
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:22,000
Sometimes I can't hold it back, you know

176
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:32,000
I used to worry about our neighbors, but not anymore because he's like a welder

177
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:34,000
Oh

178
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:40,000
I saved your life no no what no no no no

179
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:45,000
Get too many medics

180
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:51,000
It could be engineer guy I'll be soldier man

181
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:58,000
With my dirty ass hamburger gun I

182
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:02,000
Think I'm using the battle scar one because on purpose

183
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:05,000
That's priceless by I would have to my suit

184
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:19,000
I agree

185
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:24,000
This is Halloween this is Halloween

186
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:28,000
Where'd that guy even come from?

187
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:35,000
Came from Halloween

188
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:48,000
Shit

189
00:16:55,000 --> 00:17:02,000
Do I not enjoy scare Saturdays? I mean it's it's just one of those things that it did I did it for a while

190
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:06,000
I played all the scary kind of games that were around at the time and

191
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:12,000
I did it I did it it was it was interesting it was fun for me when I did it but

192
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:16,000
Now it's all played out just like don't come at it

193
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:20,000
I don't know why I went up here

194
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:22,000
You

195
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:24,000
Walked up oh yeah

196
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:31,000
Huge century

197
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:42,000
The one day germ is gonna record a game that I've been asking to make a video on for like six months

198
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:47,000
At least maybe even a year at this point who knows maybe it is potential I

199
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:50,000
Got it

200
00:17:52,000 --> 00:18:01,000
There is potential there could a good figure out maybe a Halloween video maybe that could be it. Oh boy

201
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:04,000
We're in the

202
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:06,000
In that thing there

203
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:19,000
Oh

204
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:41,000
Damn it

205
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:45,000
Damn it

206
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:53,000
He's gonna be surprised when he sees a heavy

207
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:04,000
Boy

208
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:08,000
We got a screamer that would have been great

209
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:15,000
That would have been good, but they did it like a half second earlier

210
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:22,000
I'm gonna play that new game that Stark is talking about

211
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:27,000
So I don't think it's necessarily a new game

212
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:32,000
It's actually probably quite old at this point

213
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:41,000
Are you gonna check it out

214
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:46,000
I'm gonna am I going to check it out

215
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:58,000
Oh, I just crit the fuck out of me

216
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:01,000
I

217
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:10,000
Yeah, I do have that I think I just put this on really quickly forgot again should have that on

218
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:23,000
I'm not sure if I'm a fan of this map a lot of people I don't mind it

219
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:32,000
No truck truckers are not a fan I just boss that off my fucking own face

220
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:47,000
So I dislike it it just feels very cluttered and people can like come from every direction

221
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:56,000
They really can't though they can God this guy with the mini crit eviction notice is fucking me up big time

222
00:20:58,000 --> 00:21:00,000
Spray the naran like crazy

223
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:13,000
After this round I'm gonna switch to the other map

224
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:19,000
Wow look at drama picking favorites

225
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:25,000
You know you know who doesn't pick favorites mothers

226
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:27,000
whereas

227
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:35,000
what

228
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:45,000
They have heard that

229
00:21:55,000 --> 00:22:02,000
that many

230
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:10,000
that is a trip across the map with that thing

231
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:12,000
should

232
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:16,000
is the invasion update the Halloween update

233
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:18,000
don't think it's supposed to be but

234
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:20,000
it's not, it's, I don't know.

235
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:24,000
there's, there adding, Halloween items right at some point.

236
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:26,000
yeah.

237
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:29,000
Halloween updates. Another community update.

238
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:36,000
I like, I went so high.

239
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:40,000
uh, and it goes... really high.

240
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:47,000
He charged right when I charged and I missed with that too.

241
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:53,000
I'm gonna fucking pee my pants.

242
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:54,000
You always say that.

243
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:55,000
I know I do.

244
00:22:55,000 --> 00:22:57,000
Yeah, you always do.

245
00:22:57,000 --> 00:23:00,000
I've seen your pants before.

246
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:02,000
Oh, I went for the greedy other guy.

247
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:03,000
I got it.

248
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:04,000
It's okay.

249
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:05,000
We're cool.

250
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:06,000
Hello.

251
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:08,000
Can I meet your game?

252
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:09,000
No.

253
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:10,000
No.

254
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:11,000
I'm almost done with it.

255
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:12,000
Then I'm done playing.

256
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:13,000
I gotta wrap around.

257
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:14,000
I always say that.

258
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:17,000
And then I catch you playing it later.

259
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:18,000
This people shooting me.

260
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:20,000
You're becoming very intro-sword.

261
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:21,000
Whoa.

262
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:22,000
Warning you.

263
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:23,000
No.

264
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:24,000
What if I...

265
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:25,000
Does anybody...

266
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:26,000
That was really weird.

267
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:29,000
I like teleported to the right somehow.

268
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:32,000
I'm done with Cryptarch.

269
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:33,000
It was a teleportation.

270
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:34,000
An hour later.

271
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:35,000
Stir and see if it's left.

272
00:23:35,000 --> 00:23:36,000
What a day.

273
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:38,000
Stir and see if it's left.

274
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:43,000
What a day.

275
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:54,000
You're still understanding.

276
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:55,000
Nope.

277
00:23:55,000 --> 00:23:58,000
I don't like being a gamer.

278
00:23:58,000 --> 00:24:05,000
Good.

279
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:08,000
The worst part of that is so we're living here.

280
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:10,000
There's no bathroom down where I am.

281
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:11,000
So if I have to go...

282
00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:15,000
If I have to really pee real bad, I have to go all the way up like the stairs.

283
00:24:15,000 --> 00:24:16,000
Oh no.

284
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:17,000
No.

285
00:24:17,000 --> 00:24:18,000
No my god.

286
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:19,000
He's gotta go upstairs.

287
00:24:19,000 --> 00:24:20,000
I need your new stairs.

288
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:21,000
There's something today.

289
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:22,000
Alright.

290
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:26,000
I'm going to a server.

291
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:28,000
This is a probed map.

292
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:30,000
I am not a fan.

293
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:33,000
I'm not a hater of this map but I'm not really a fan of it either.

294
00:24:33,000 --> 00:24:37,000
I don't know if you just walk up the door like I don't know.

295
00:24:37,000 --> 00:24:38,000
I'll tell.

296
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:39,000
I'm going to go pee.

297
00:24:39,000 --> 00:24:40,000
That's fine.

298
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:41,000
I'm going to go pee.

299
00:24:41,000 --> 00:24:49,000
You got a pee on top of his pee so you know so that he knows that you're boss.

300
00:24:49,000 --> 00:24:53,000
Let's go to...

301
00:24:53,000 --> 00:25:00,000
I read that if you pee on top of pee it's twice the amount of pee.

302
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:03,000
I think you read that.

303
00:25:03,000 --> 00:25:05,000
I really didn't even like hear what you said.

304
00:25:05,000 --> 00:25:07,000
What did you say if you pee on top of pee?

305
00:25:07,000 --> 00:25:08,000
It wasn't important.

306
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:10,000
It really wasn't.

307
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:13,000
Now sometimes I just talk.

308
00:25:13,000 --> 00:25:14,000
I do.

309
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:15,000
Yeah.

310
00:25:15,000 --> 00:25:16,000
You do that sometimes.

311
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:19,000
Now sometimes I like don't listen to anything that you're saying.

312
00:25:19,000 --> 00:25:22,000
No yeah that happens quite often as well.

313
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:31,000
Alright give me a high coup quick about the invasion update.

314
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:35,000
I would have to count my hands and I don't have a hand free.

315
00:25:35,000 --> 00:25:37,000
You don't have a hand free.

316
00:25:37,000 --> 00:25:40,000
Yeah how many is 575?

317
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:42,000
Yeah it's 575 or 757.

318
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:44,000
I think it's 575.

319
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:46,000
That's separately 575.

320
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:47,000
Yes it is.

321
00:25:47,000 --> 00:25:48,000
Wow.

322
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:51,000
I'm back in middle school right now.

323
00:25:51,000 --> 00:25:55,000
The most popular poem structure in the world.

324
00:25:55,000 --> 00:25:59,000
How does it feel to be a high coup?

325
00:25:59,000 --> 00:26:02,000
Let's go in the beam together guys.

326
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:04,000
Actually I know how this like works.

327
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:05,000
That is actually work.

328
00:26:05,000 --> 00:26:10,000
We only play this with demons.

329
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:13,000
That's the beer bottle thing.

330
00:26:13,000 --> 00:26:14,000
It's going on right here.

331
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:15,000
Like nobody's fight.

332
00:26:15,000 --> 00:26:20,000
Everyone just like glitching into the beam.

333
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:25,000
Dude I think the demon souls are from doing the.

334
00:26:25,000 --> 00:26:30,000
The treasure things.

335
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:32,000
Get those beer bottles.

336
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:37,000
You get more?

337
00:26:37,000 --> 00:26:38,000
No.

338
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:41,000
Do you know where it's me?

339
00:26:41,000 --> 00:26:42,000
No that he's still alive.

340
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:45,000
You have to do the challenges I think.

341
00:26:45,000 --> 00:26:46,000
I see.

342
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:47,000
There he is.

343
00:26:47,000 --> 00:26:48,000
There he is.

344
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:53,000
Don't let him get away.

345
00:26:53,000 --> 00:26:56,000
I get six beer bottles.

346
00:26:56,000 --> 00:26:59,000
That means I can heal people.

347
00:26:59,000 --> 00:27:04,000
Cool.

348
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:06,000
Oh come back here dude.

349
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:07,000

Where's that soldier?

353
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:23,000
You fell.

354
00:27:23,000 --> 00:27:25,000
There everyone's fallen.

355
00:27:25,000 --> 00:27:27,000
I'm just going to deposit my beer bottles.

356
00:27:27,000 --> 00:27:34,000
Hopefully I can do this without dying.

357
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:35,000

Fine you know what scout you know what.

360
00:27:43,000 --> 00:27:48,000
Let's go for it.

361
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:51,000
Get that soldier.

362
00:27:51,000 --> 00:27:54,000
I doubt.

363
00:27:54,000 --> 00:27:58,000
You know that's how much healthy he had.

364
00:27:58,000 --> 00:28:04,000
I got switched.

365
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:06,000
That was the funniest thing you've said so far.

366
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:09,000
You have you have to one off that.

367
00:28:09,000 --> 00:28:11,000
Far North.

368
00:28:11,000 --> 00:28:14,000
That was the best thing you've done.

369
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:17,000
That was your whole your whole YouTube career.

370
00:28:17,000 --> 00:28:20,000
That was it.

371
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:23,000
Well.

372
00:28:23,000 --> 00:28:26,000
Only downhill from here.

373
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:28,000
Well.

374
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:31,000
Generally.

375
00:28:31,000 --> 00:28:42,000
He had so many beer bottles too.

376
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:49,000
I mean this guy had.

377
00:28:49,000 --> 00:28:59,000
He's only going anywhere.

378
00:28:59,000 --> 00:29:06,000
Give me the heal.

379
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:13,000
Give me up there.

380
00:29:13,000 --> 00:29:16,000
Give me all your bottles.

381
00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:19,000
How many do you have?

382
00:29:19,000 --> 00:29:26,000
Quite a few but I can't do anything now.

383
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:34,000
Stop sneaking up on me.

384
00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:52,000
There you go.

385
00:29:52,000 --> 00:30:01,000
I was trying to go for some cheeky little shit there.

386
00:30:01,000 --> 00:30:08,000
I thought that was some guy just going we are in the beam.

387
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:14,000
That's a text to speech program.

388
00:30:14,000 --> 00:30:18,000
I'm like something that you would accuse it of.

389
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:21,000
That's not the first time I've heard it either.

390
00:30:21,000 --> 00:30:24,000
Somebody else was saying that too.

391
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:30,000
I'm not talking about this.

392
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:37,000
The battle has enough resources to hire a guy to say.

393
00:30:37,000 --> 00:30:41,000
The valve didn't make it.

394
00:30:41,000 --> 00:30:47,000
The valve didn't make it.

395
00:30:47,000 --> 00:30:49,000
11 I'm gonna go for that guy

396
00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:04,000
How are you there are you

397
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:18,000
Wow that guy's good 19 shit that guy knows I don't have any health

398
00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:28,000
I don't even have I just have like random dumb hats on the sniper

399
00:31:35,000 --> 00:31:43,000
20 deposit those 20 make our lead stronger

400
00:31:51,000 --> 00:31:55,000
God every time I've aimed in I'm gonna hit with a fucking I'm gonna put the

401
00:31:55,000 --> 00:31:57,000
camp around

402
00:32:05,000 --> 00:32:09,000
I'll give you a 14 to find for that sniper

403
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:14,000

404
00:32:21,000 --> 00:32:23,000

408
00:32:37,000 --> 00:32:39,000

Trade for a sniper you trying to seduce somebody. What do you want to trade?

410

Let's try to you for 14 refine. I hope it's not worth it. I give you a key

411
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:02,000
I don't think that guy's watching the stream

412
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:07,000
I really don't think he is I don't think so

413
00:33:16,000 --> 00:33:22,000
Wow, Jeremy you should have the HUD that takes away the people that's right you have that cool funny little HUD

414

419
00:34:09,000 --> 00:34:11,000
No, that was way off

420
00:34:17,000 --> 00:34:19,000
Oh my god fucking damn it

421
00:34:27,000 --> 00:34:29,000
We are in the big

422
00:34:34,000 --> 00:34:36,000
I

423
00:34:36,000 --> 00:34:40,000
Really like this it didn't did what's it called the no stromo or something genuine no straw. What's it called?

424
00:34:41,000 --> 00:34:43,000
Genuine no stromo napalmer

425
00:34:44,000 --> 00:34:47,000
I like how that's true dumbass. You have no stradamas is flame throw

426
00:34:52,000 --> 00:34:54,000
Let's rate him to key fairy

427
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:02,000
Century in there that's good enough

428
00:35:04,000 --> 00:35:06,000
There we

429
00:35:11,000 --> 00:35:14,000
That's is that's like respawning in 50 seconds

430
00:35:16,000 --> 00:35:22,000
Okay, there that that's why if you trade me I'll let you respawn 50 second respawn

431
00:35:29,000 --> 00:35:31,000
I'll try I'll do that

432
00:35:32,000 --> 00:35:36,000
I run around as a scout guy. I'm gonna take this off though. I'll put the ham sandwich on

433
00:35:37,000 --> 00:35:39,000
Um, I just want to say real quickly

434
00:35:39,000 --> 00:35:42,000
That demmy god is still being sold for $10

435
00:35:43,000 --> 00:35:45,000
Is it that on steam? Yeah

436
00:35:47,000 --> 00:35:49,000
That game that can't be played

437
00:35:51,000 --> 00:35:53,000
Can't be played can't play demigods

438
00:35:53,000 --> 00:35:59,000
What I tried once and I opened the game and it was like oh those servers are down because this game is old

439
00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:02,000
You serious yeah

440
00:36:04,000 --> 00:36:07,000
So I'm a little something wrong about that or like they've added server in the game

441
00:36:10,000 --> 00:36:12,000
That's strange

442
00:36:12,000 --> 00:36:14,000
Not as strange as that scatter again

443
00:36:16,000 --> 00:36:21,000
I know my you know you can't have it okay you can't have this you have all the purple glowers

444
00:36:22,000 --> 00:36:25,000
Yeah, it's about purple man. It's my favorite color

445
00:36:30,000 --> 00:36:34,000
What what level is it

446
00:36:37,000 --> 00:36:39,000
Oh, let's take a look

447
00:36:39,000 --> 00:36:46,000
Feel tested. Do I have any other ones that are I have a factory new this one's strong

448
00:36:46,000 --> 00:36:50,000
I don't like this one though this one you can't even really tell you're wearing it like look ready

449
00:36:52,000 --> 00:36:54,000
It's like when you're running around I'll put the factory you on

450
00:36:54,000 --> 00:36:56,000
like

451
00:36:59,000 --> 00:37:02,000
Like it's hard to even know that this is a different scatter gun

452
00:37:04,000 --> 00:37:09,000
You have to really especially like a weird world model too like you have to like really like what is your design on that

453
00:37:10,000 --> 00:37:12,000
Night terror that's what I'm that's not all about

454
00:37:12,000 --> 00:37:16,000
You can't even really tell if there's an accepted it you know like at the right light you can see it

455
00:37:17,000 --> 00:37:19,000
Well, you have to press the inspect key all the time

456
00:37:20,000 --> 00:37:23,000
Like as you watch me run around like it's hard to even determine if I'm wearing anything

457
00:37:24,000 --> 00:37:26,000
All right fine. I'll okay. You want to do that?

458
00:37:26,000 --> 00:37:28,000
Is that what you want to do?

459
00:37:28,000 --> 00:37:30,000
Do you want to please wear some clothes?

460
00:37:32,000 --> 00:37:39,000
105 what do you got let's see it I got 10 let's see it. I want to see how much damage you do

461
00:37:43,000 --> 00:37:45,000
All right go beyond your merry way

462
00:37:46,000 --> 00:37:48,000
That wasn't even that wasn't as much damage as I did

463
00:37:52,000 --> 00:37:54,000
I only hit you once too

464
00:37:54,000 --> 00:38:01,000
You are in I only hit you once you hit me more than once. I just want to see what you had I want to see what you got

465
00:38:04,000 --> 00:38:06,000
All right, that's how it's gonna be

466
00:38:10,000 --> 00:38:12,000
Okay, that's the way it is

467
00:38:13,000 --> 00:38:15,000
You

468
00:38:22,000 --> 00:38:24,000
Can't wait for me pyro

469
00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:32,000
You don't look like you're streaming team fortress to me. I am streaming team fortress to you and a bunch of other people that are watching

470
00:38:33,000 --> 00:38:35,000
Yeah

471
00:38:39,000 --> 00:38:41,000
I'll correct you. I'm sorry

472
00:38:42,000 --> 00:38:44,000
You

473
00:38:44,000 --> 00:38:49,000
Someone says in chat kill that dumbass. Please drama and he's referring to me. I'm sure

474
00:38:49,000 --> 00:38:51,000
You'd go to jail

475
00:38:53,000 --> 00:38:59,000
I might jump on this guy. I just like jumped at his sword pretty sure killing dumbass is illegal

476
00:39:01,000 --> 00:39:05,000
You go to court. I think the judge just says oh yeah, it was a dumbass wasn't it?

477
00:39:05,000 --> 00:39:08,000
No, if you can prove that they were in dumbass you can get away with it

478
00:39:08,000 --> 00:39:14,000
I get so upset whenever time I see a heavy crotch with melee. It's like I'm conditioned to become angry as soon as it happens

479
00:39:22,000 --> 00:39:24,000
Well, there's a soda there

480
00:39:25,000 --> 00:39:27,000
Let's call the soda

481
00:39:27,000 --> 00:39:29,000
Yeah, you did

482
00:39:29,000 --> 00:39:31,000
Actually truck truck always calls them soda pops

483
00:39:31,000 --> 00:39:33,000
You

484
00:39:36,000 --> 00:39:38,000
How have you not died

485
00:39:40,000 --> 00:39:42,000
It's a hit point system that the game uses

486
00:39:45,000 --> 00:39:48,000
Get in it come on come on. Oh, he's getting

487
00:39:51,000 --> 00:39:53,000
Stay in the beam

488
00:39:53,000 --> 00:39:54,000
Hooray

489
00:39:54,000 --> 00:39:58,000
dumbasses are important resource and are protected. Oh

490
00:39:59,000 --> 00:40:01,000
So they're like migratory birds

491
00:40:04,000 --> 00:40:06,000
I can't see underwater

492
00:40:07,000 --> 00:40:09,000
Drama how does it feel to be a migratory bird?

493
00:40:11,000 --> 00:40:14,000
Oh, no good one. Fuck it is misquicked

494
00:40:17,000 --> 00:40:19,000
We are in the stream

495
00:40:20,000 --> 00:40:22,000
I

496
00:40:24,000 --> 00:40:30,000
Is it hit the hit the guy with like every other pellet from the gun

497
00:40:32,000 --> 00:40:34,000
Fortunately

498
00:40:37,000 --> 00:40:46,000
You're my dude is here truck truck there's there's a visual novel on steam about someone becoming a starcraft 2 pro

499
00:40:47,000 --> 00:40:49,000
That seems like the weirdest

500
00:40:49,000 --> 00:40:51,000
How can you not gonna buy it?

501
00:40:51,000 --> 00:40:54,000
I'm tempted. Oh, it's free. It's free license

502
00:40:55,000 --> 00:40:57,000
Let's see it

503
00:40:58,000 --> 00:41:03,000
It's recommended by the curator total this says it's great curator

504
00:41:06,000 --> 00:41:09,000
Yeah, I've been acting like so much about stuff that three from the visual novel

505
00:41:12,000 --> 00:41:14,000
That's that's so on

506
00:41:17,000 --> 00:41:19,000
I did he do

507
00:41:19,000 --> 00:41:22,000
I didn't he curious wow he just fucking jurors he down

508
00:41:26,000 --> 00:41:28,000
Oh, that a case

509
00:41:31,000 --> 00:41:37,000
Where how can I still haven't seen a invasion

510
00:41:37,000 --> 00:41:42,000
Great because that was that just a gun wait a minute hold on was that a gun metal case

511
00:41:43,000 --> 00:41:48,000
Yes, it was I actually haven't well I haven't played in a couple days, but I haven't

512
00:41:50,000 --> 00:41:56,000
Obviously gotten the invasion case drop. Well, that seems a little strange. They're dropping the gun metal cases

513
00:41:57,000 --> 00:41:59,000
still

514
00:42:00,000 --> 00:42:02,000
You think that that would that kind of drop would be replaced

515
00:42:04,000 --> 00:42:06,000
Thanks, so

516
00:42:10,000 --> 00:42:12,000

517
00:42:12,000 --> 00:42:14,000

520
00:42:27,000 --> 00:42:30,000
Just bring out the ham that's like in very very important just strategy

521
00:42:31,000 --> 00:42:33,000
You

522
00:42:40,000 --> 00:42:42,000
Hold you

523
00:42:56,000 --> 00:42:58,000
Oh

524
00:42:58,000 --> 00:43:05,000
That bloody loot right box like a door cube that's what it was the door cube be careful sniper

525
00:43:15,000 --> 00:43:17,000
Yeah

526
00:43:17,000 --> 00:43:19,000
Yeah

527
00:43:21,000 --> 00:43:23,000
Now

528
00:43:24,000 --> 00:43:29,000
The inversion crates of a stupidly ridiculously low drop rate

529
00:43:30,000 --> 00:43:34,000
They're not more expensive after the event is over there less expensive

530
00:43:34,000 --> 00:43:40,000
What's going on? I got Boston Bashar sticking out of his forearm. That doesn't compute. That's a fun new glitch

531
00:43:40,000 --> 00:43:42,000
It's a bug

532
00:43:49,000 --> 00:43:52,000
Quiet game commentary with hints of conversation night

533
00:43:53,000 --> 00:43:55,000
Hits of conversation

534
00:43:58,000 --> 00:44:01,000
Derma can't hold the conversation while he plays a game. I can't

535
00:44:02,000 --> 00:44:07,000
If I like I'm like focusing on a video game. I cannot talk otherwise the amount of times like this

536
00:44:08,000 --> 00:44:13,000
You've told me like oh like a why aren't you talking I usually like conversate in your stream

537
00:44:14,000 --> 00:44:16,000
Same reason right we are in the

538
00:44:17,000 --> 00:44:23,000
No like you've you've asked me to like start up conversations before while you're streaming and if I like ask you questions

539
00:44:23,000 --> 00:44:30,000
Are trying to talk to you I'd never get a response. You're just like not there. I'm here. Let's stop. I'm here

540
00:44:30,000 --> 00:44:33,000
Hey, you want to know nothing right now?

541
00:44:34,000 --> 00:44:37,000
Well, come on. What do you want to know auto auto auto is right behind me?

542
00:44:38,000 --> 00:44:40,000
sleeping

543
00:44:41,000 --> 00:44:44,000
Like it's I guess I can tell the story of how I took him out today

544
00:44:44,000 --> 00:44:47,000
And he tell us so I took auto out today

545
00:44:48,000 --> 00:44:53,000
And we were doing the doing the you go to the bathroom dog go outside and pee and poo

546
00:44:53,000 --> 00:44:58,000
We all know how to look that slight the bathroom dog. Yeah, so I take bathroom dog out and

547
00:44:59,000 --> 00:45:00,000
And

548
00:45:00,000 --> 00:45:07,000
We're doing fine. He pees. He pees and I noticed that there's like there's some sticky things all over his feet

549
00:45:07,000 --> 00:45:09,000
We're walking around like in the wooded area you

550
00:45:10,000 --> 00:45:12,000
Well, we were like in like a wood path

551
00:45:12,000 --> 00:45:18,000
So he gets ends up getting these he must have stepped in like sap or something like tree sap out of no day

552
00:45:18,000 --> 00:45:21,000
What the hell he could have stepped in he was climbing the trees. Yes

553
00:45:22,000 --> 00:45:24,000
and

554
00:45:24,000 --> 00:45:26,000
He uh shit all on I

555
00:45:27,000 --> 00:45:29,000
Gotta pay attention. I'm getting I'm getting critical crate

556
00:45:32,000 --> 00:45:35,000
Doesn't that count Ming learned I didn't get creeper. All right. I was kidding

557
00:45:36,000 --> 00:45:41,000
So he ended up having these like flippers of leaves all over him

558
00:45:41,000 --> 00:45:43,000
He was it was as if he was gonna go scuba diving

559
00:45:44,000 --> 00:45:48,000
He had leaf scuba flippers for every single foot and he was just like

560
00:45:49,000 --> 00:45:51,000
Walking really awkwardly and I was like what the hell is this dog doing?

561
00:45:52,000 --> 00:45:57,000
And finally I like looked at his hands and like they were the ground was coming up with him

562
00:45:58,000 --> 00:46:03,000
So I spent like at least 20 to 30 minutes cleaning this dog's hands and feet

563
00:46:04,000 --> 00:46:07,000
And he didn't know that I was your dog dormit

564
00:46:09,000 --> 00:46:11,000
Like I just died

565
00:46:12,000 --> 00:46:17,000
Might have been like a homeless man. You found in a leaf pile. Yeah, I confused a homeless man with a dog

566
00:46:18,000 --> 00:46:22,000
You spent 30 minutes cleaning him and there was a homeless man under instead of your dog

567
00:46:23,000 --> 00:46:25,000
I don't think that's what happened

568
00:46:25,000 --> 00:46:27,000
Dog hands

569
00:46:27,000 --> 00:46:29,000
It was very uh it was very odd

570
00:46:33,000 --> 00:46:35,000
And it's not the first time that's happened before

571
00:46:37,000 --> 00:46:41,000
That is that's happened to this dog like at least one or two times before I

572
00:46:41,000 --> 00:46:45,000
Think your dog is part gecko. I don't know. He's got release. He's got really sticky hands

573
00:46:46,000 --> 00:46:49,000
Sticky feet. I mean hands. Sorry. Well both

574
00:46:54,000 --> 00:46:57,000
If you could give your dog one superpower what would it be?

575
00:47:02,000 --> 00:47:05,000
I would put money obviously one superpower

576
00:47:07,000 --> 00:47:12,000
That's actually really really tough question because one could be like poop gold. Oh no

577
00:47:12,000 --> 00:47:16,000
Okay, no poop at all. There you go. There you go. No, we're rephrasing the question

578
00:47:17,000 --> 00:47:24,000
Your superpower also has to be a power that like someone from the X-Men or like a real superhero has you can't change their poop

579
00:47:24,000 --> 00:47:26,000
No one has

580
00:47:27,000 --> 00:47:32,000
So it needs to have a superpower and it needs to be like a real superpower and not a change in power

581
00:47:33,000 --> 00:47:35,000
Okay, he has weird poops, okay

582
00:47:36,000 --> 00:47:37,000
Oh

583
00:47:38,000 --> 00:47:39,000
Professor X

584
00:47:39,000 --> 00:47:42,000
He's just a powerfully chicken. You're making fun of handicapped people

585
00:47:43,000 --> 00:47:45,000
for what?

586
00:47:45,000 --> 00:47:49,000
Professor X is like the most intelligent like telepathic mind ever

587
00:47:49,000 --> 00:47:52,000
Yeah, I would just be like auto

588
00:47:52,000 --> 00:47:57,000
Can he understand English or does he not does is he does he have these powers, but I can't ask him to do anything

589
00:47:58,000 --> 00:48:01,000
Whatever power it is you have to pick which power you want him to have

590
00:48:02,000 --> 00:48:06,000
Why is this popular one thousand viewers question mark team fortress two

591
00:48:09,000 --> 00:48:11,000
Why is this popular

592
00:48:13,000 --> 00:48:16,000
I mean if he if he had professor Xavier's power

593
00:48:16,000 --> 00:48:20,000
He still wouldn't be able to talk because his power isn't to talk his power is

594
00:48:20,000 --> 00:48:24,000
Connecting minds with other people so like maybe auto could like be in your head

595
00:48:24,000 --> 00:48:28,000
Then I would have the beast power because then the dog could talk and it'd still be a beast

596
00:48:29,000 --> 00:48:30,000
I

597
00:48:30,000 --> 00:48:33,000
You know what I don't know that probably give him like

598
00:48:36,000 --> 00:48:38,000
Is there a character that can

599
00:48:38,000 --> 00:48:44,000
Beast is a good choice because he's extremely like smart and he can like move around and he's would the dog be as big as beast

600
00:48:46,000 --> 00:48:50,000
He would slowly start turning like a blue and growing like

601
00:48:50,000 --> 00:48:57,000
Huge he wouldn't be huge, but he'd he'd start mutating I guess or you can have like a night crawler dog

602
00:48:59,000 --> 00:49:01,000
Ha

603
00:49:01,000 --> 00:49:03,000
You could let himself outside

604
00:49:05,000 --> 00:49:11,000
No, he just keeps teleporting after everything and then he's fantastic for what the fuck is how many blue people are on this other team

605
00:49:12,000 --> 00:49:15,000
Fantastic four stretchy guy. I want a stretchy dog. No

606
00:49:18,000 --> 00:49:23,000
No, there was just seven people there with no red two people on this team. I put my foot down on stretchy dog

607
00:49:24,000 --> 00:49:27,000
I want a stretchy dog even that or the flame on guys. It's just

608
00:49:27,000 --> 00:49:32,000
It would just stretch it. Come on. It's a bed and poop in the bed. The human flame get his name right fucking idiot

609
00:49:33,000 --> 00:49:36,000
Oh my god. What's the name of the the guy who stretches dr. Dooh?

610
00:49:37,000 --> 00:49:46,000
Oh, not dr. Dooh. This is a fantastic. That's his name. It's stupid name. It is a stupid power and is a stupid character. It's the human torts of the human flame

611
00:49:48,000 --> 00:49:52,000
Human flame. Yeah, you fucking idiot. You fucking idiot

612
00:49:53,000 --> 00:49:55,000
You fucking idiot

613
00:49:55,000 --> 00:50:01,000
Fabrik time. I hate the fantastic one. The worst of yours for what why side is dr. Dooh?

614
00:50:01,000 --> 00:50:05,000
You mean what am I stuck on what the fuck is happening about why the face

615
00:50:08,000 --> 00:50:12,000
The name is the thing girl. He's covered with rocks. I didn't know it's that

616
00:50:15,000 --> 00:50:17,000
Gummy boy and gummy boy

617
00:50:18,000 --> 00:50:24,000
Dude gummy give me those give me those

618
00:50:25,000 --> 00:50:28,000
Gumby and cool plowers but he's not an X-man. There does account

619
00:50:29,000 --> 00:50:33,000
All right, there could be an X-man. There could be an X-man. Yeah

620
00:50:37,000 --> 00:50:42,000
Toad I think if I wanted to be like in all the movies I'd be wolf or mean

621
00:50:42,000 --> 00:50:44,000
I

622
00:50:46,000 --> 00:50:53,000
You wanted to be you want to have the best like exclusive deals. I feel like no matter how good your power is like the less screen time you're getting

623
00:50:54,000 --> 00:51:00,000
Because that guy who could like run really fast and slow time pretty much like he may he was cut out because he didn't made everything too easy

624
00:51:00,000 --> 00:51:02,000
But like Wolverine

625
00:51:02,000 --> 00:51:08,000
Yeah, he had to really attractive man really vascular dude very vascular his power was too good

626
00:51:09,000 --> 00:51:10,000
Yeah

627
00:51:10,000 --> 00:51:16,000
I'd be into that and you could live for a really good. I can't gene gray like end the planet if she really wanted to

628
00:51:17,000 --> 00:51:19,000
Yes, why she dies

629
00:51:19,000 --> 00:51:25,000
So everyone tries to kill her you want everyone to try to kill you yeah, but she can't control it because she can't

630
00:51:26,000 --> 00:51:31,000
You don't want to be too great the fuck really yeah, then people get mad at you for using her in Marvel

631
00:51:34,000 --> 00:51:36,000
You call you a scrub

632
00:51:37,000 --> 00:51:39,000
Yeah, maybe like four years ago on anyone here

633
00:51:40,000 --> 00:51:44,000
How come every time I go to a class as always is like it turns into like four of them. That's where you know

634
00:51:46,000 --> 00:51:48,000
I like to spy

635
00:51:48,000 --> 00:51:50,000
Maybe a try spy

636
00:51:51,000 --> 00:51:53,000
Pixelver was cut out because of copyright issues

637
00:51:54,000 --> 00:51:56,000
You serious who owned is somebody else own quickseller

638
00:51:57,000 --> 00:52:00,000
It wasn't the adventure movie for some reason instead of the X-Men movies

639
00:52:03,000 --> 00:52:08,000
Which I find so suspicious that's weird and scarlet witch which is a terrible name

640
00:52:11,000 --> 00:52:13,000
You

641
00:52:14,000 --> 00:52:16,000
Jesus what the hell is I think in there

642
00:52:18,000 --> 00:52:20,000
What the fuck was I doing?

643
00:52:21,000 --> 00:52:23,000
No, I was staying spy I was just dumb

644
00:52:24,000 --> 00:52:26,000
Isn't there actually supposed to be a new season of heroes coming out?

645
00:52:27,000 --> 00:52:34,000
Your house is it a spin-off? Where's it actual? Oh, it's an actual hero's I think something killed some of the characters because like actors

646
00:52:34,000 --> 00:52:39,000
Not returning but like heroes is hitting a new season which I really don't think was a show is so old

647
00:52:39,000 --> 00:52:47,000
Show us a random in red there's no like continuity between anything. It's like each season. It's like oh here's a different timeline

648
00:52:50,000 --> 00:52:52,000
I hear that somebody made pancakes in

649
00:52:52,000 --> 00:52:58,000
That is the best scene in the whole show and that makes me like I like love that so that scene is one of my favorite moments

650
00:52:58,000 --> 00:53:01,000
Television that's why I mentioned it because your voice did that little thing

651
00:53:05,000 --> 00:53:07,000
Wow

652
00:53:07,000 --> 00:53:10,000
Siler make pancakes for his son. He's just like missing out

653
00:53:13,000 --> 00:53:15,000
Give me the water

654
00:53:16,000 --> 00:53:19,000
The spy of the beer stuck on him. It's pretty funny

655
00:53:21,000 --> 00:53:23,000
It's like stuck to his head

656
00:53:25,000 --> 00:53:31,000
Oh, get away from me. I'm a sniper on this team. How dare you try to kill me two hypothermic better call Saul

657
00:53:32,000 --> 00:53:34,000

658
00:53:34,000 --> 00:53:36,000
I

659
00:53:36,000 --> 00:53:38,000
Want to call Saul did that just fucking have it

660
00:53:41,000 --> 00:53:46,000
You got turd he wasn't even trying to hit me and he creeped me in the face and I instantly died germa do you watch it show better

661
00:53:46,000 --> 00:53:51,000
Call Saul Gritio. Yeah, yes. Yeah, yeah, I just I hope I hope um

662
00:53:53,000 --> 00:53:57,000
I wasn't really like a fan of how they ended that last episode

663
00:53:58,000 --> 00:54:04,000
Not me neither and I called it and you didn't believe what I really didn't believe it. Yeah, I didn't I've already forgiven them. We don't need to

664
00:54:06,000 --> 00:54:11,000
You okay? Huh, maybe I haven't forgiven there waffles on pancakes

665
00:54:11,000 --> 00:54:14,000
That's alright. That's a really late response. You probably like looked it up

666
00:54:17,000 --> 00:54:20,000
I would have liked to seem like much ragged out kind of like why that happened to him kind of thing

667
00:54:23,000 --> 00:54:25,000
No one knows your job

668
00:54:28,000 --> 00:54:30,000
You can't see me

669
00:54:31,000 --> 00:54:33,000
You can't see me

670
00:54:33,000 --> 00:54:35,000
Yeah, no spoilers

671
00:54:35,000 --> 00:54:39,000
Spoilers how would they like that's an episode I don't pay attention

672
00:54:40,000 --> 00:54:44,000
So I if I'm gonna be like not ever once you last a moment you've paid attention

673
00:54:46,000 --> 00:54:51,000
I just I when I was just playing Spire right there that last life. I was paying attention to everything people were saying

674
00:54:52,000 --> 00:54:55,000
And I just walked around and just swung at medics faces

675
00:54:57,000 --> 00:54:59,000
Truck truck can you come in the call and laugh

676
00:55:03,000 --> 00:55:07,000
Probably hasn't you our stripes. Oh boy. You always take me seriously

677
00:55:09,000 --> 00:55:11,000
I'm booting you

678
00:55:13,000 --> 00:55:15,000
And you got me

679
00:55:17,000 --> 00:55:19,000
I thought I had this on for some dumb reason

680
00:55:21,000 --> 00:55:26,000
So you're talking understand language that's what you want it. You just screaming. Oh, die

681
00:55:26,000 --> 00:55:30,000
Does he understand that you're playing a game? Wouldn't he understand context? What do you understand context or what?

682
00:55:31,000 --> 00:55:34,000
I don't know maybe he missed out on the context because he doesn't know what video games are

683
00:55:34,000 --> 00:55:39,000
Like he hasn't learned that yet because he just came smart and now you're screaming die and he would like run away

684
00:55:42,000 --> 00:55:44,000
I don't know

685
00:55:45,000 --> 00:55:47,000
I'm talking about dogs with superpowers

686
00:55:48,000 --> 00:55:49,000
It's a good question

687
00:55:49,000 --> 00:55:53,000
Whenever you're in like in like when you're a small infant child

688
00:55:54,000 --> 00:55:56,000
The question is always like oh, what's super how would you have?

689
00:55:57,000 --> 00:56:01,000
What's probably your dog have because you have to consider you you're not you're not direct control that

690
00:56:02,000 --> 00:56:05,000
It's very important. I think that's a question that not enough people know their answer to

691
00:56:07,000 --> 00:56:15,000
No good point. Yeah, if you can't answer these questions like who are you? What's the point? Why are you even around? Why don't you have a dog?

692
00:56:16,000 --> 00:56:18,000
Yeah, why don't you have a dog dude?

693
00:56:20,000 --> 00:56:22,000
Get with it

694
00:56:24,000 --> 00:56:27,000
How is the invasion update you're watching it

695
00:56:28,000 --> 00:56:33,000
My dog would be crypto the dog because he could both talk and he had all the powers of Superman

696
00:56:33,000 --> 00:56:36,000
Which are you could pretty much just pull out of your pocket and just pick one

697
00:56:37,000 --> 00:56:39,000
Mine would be the super horse

698
00:56:39,000 --> 00:56:42,000
There was also like the powers of Superman, but it was a horse, but it couldn't talk

699
00:56:43,000 --> 00:56:45,000
It's just like a horse

700
00:56:45,000 --> 00:56:47,000
It's not real thing. Yes

701
00:56:48,000 --> 00:56:51,000
You're like all the unicorn no

702
00:56:52,000 --> 00:56:56,000
There's like in love with the chick, too. It's like oh, I thought like a teller. I could how I feel

703
00:56:57,000 --> 00:57:02,000
It's like a horse unicorns of this dude. That's a deep level of usually. I don't

704
00:57:03,000 --> 00:57:05,000
Where'd he go?

705
00:57:05,000 --> 00:57:07,000
comics man, they're crazy

706
00:57:13,000 --> 00:57:15,000
Wow

707
00:57:15,000 --> 00:57:17,000
Didn't hit him

708
00:57:20,000 --> 00:57:22,000
I guess got a fancy spell book on

709
00:57:24,000 --> 00:57:28,000
Comment the super horse was that his name that sounds right that sounds really right

710
00:57:29,000 --> 00:57:31,000
I don't know if I want my dog to have like

711
00:57:31,000 --> 00:57:33,000
Wolverine powers because that wouldn't wouldn't he like

712
00:57:34,000 --> 00:57:37,000
Not ever mind. He always got Wolverine's not immortal, right?

713
00:57:38,000 --> 00:57:43,000
He just can't like die, right? He feels immediately like after like a day or so

714
00:57:43,000 --> 00:57:45,000
Skeleton and Adam Mattingham girl

715
00:57:45,000 --> 00:57:47,000
That isn't part of his power

716
00:57:47,000 --> 00:57:53,000
So you're gonna say that it's not part of his power because that cuz it was built that was built into him

717
00:57:53,000 --> 00:57:58,000
You're right. Yeah, yeah, it's like explained it because during would be yeah

718
00:57:59,000 --> 00:58:01,000
Your dog would just have like long nails which is

719
00:58:03,000 --> 00:58:05,000
Sabertooth's power

720
00:58:05,000 --> 00:58:12,000
Yeah, that's the worst power ever. I don't know how they like tried to like have him be cool and also fight Wolverine

721
00:58:12,000 --> 00:58:15,000
Toad I have a long fingernails toad

722
00:58:16,000 --> 00:58:18,000
Toad is cool. He is cool

723
00:58:19,000 --> 00:58:22,000
It's cuz he's like the reject one. Yeah, but he's toad

724
00:58:23,000 --> 00:58:26,000
Toad doesn't like really do anything. He just kind of has a long tongue and jumps around

725
00:58:27,000 --> 00:58:29,000
Yeah, he can shoot mucus out of his throat

726
00:58:30,000 --> 00:58:32,000
Think of all the things you could do with mucus and a long tongue

727
00:58:33,000 --> 00:58:35,000
I know what you can do with a lot of mucus you have been real sick

728
00:58:37,000 --> 00:58:39,000
It sucks

729
00:58:39,000 --> 00:58:43,000
So he do it you just like nothing you can't what are you gonna do with me?

730
00:58:43,000 --> 00:58:45,000
It's what he does

731
00:58:45,000 --> 00:58:47,000
It's just

732
00:58:48,000 --> 00:58:50,000
It didn't like burn people

733
00:58:51,000 --> 00:58:53,000
That's that's not like

734
00:58:56,000 --> 00:58:59,000
Spatems Storm's face in the movie does a real disgusting eventually

735
00:59:00,000 --> 00:59:03,000
Hit him with lightning. It's in the worst line in any movie ever

736
00:59:04,000 --> 00:59:05,000
Like well, I don't know

737
00:59:05,000 --> 00:59:08,000
Do you know it happens to a toad when it's checked by lightning

738
00:59:09,000 --> 00:59:11,000
The same thing that happens to everything else

739
00:59:16,000 --> 00:59:21,000
You got to know the Wolverine does have his claws even without the metal they would just made of bone instead

740
00:59:21,000 --> 00:59:23,000
Yeah for no reason

741
00:59:26,000 --> 00:59:29,000
Those bone claws are like dumb who is he the bone guy

742
00:59:30,000 --> 00:59:34,000
Saber to yeah, the bone you had the extra long fingernails. That's what I'm saying

743
00:59:39,000 --> 00:59:41,000
Well, I want Darwin's power so there

744
00:59:43,000 --> 00:59:47,000
This is probably you could like change his body into any shape he wanted

745
00:59:47,000 --> 00:59:50,000
How did I not hit this guy like are we fucking for real?

746
00:59:51,000 --> 00:59:53,000
He was on screen for like 10 minutes that he died

747
00:59:54,000 --> 00:59:58,000
Did you just say you changed your body into a penis? That's what anyone would do

748
00:59:59,000 --> 01:00:01,000
Not me

749
01:00:02,000 --> 01:00:04,000
Wow

750
01:00:04,000 --> 01:00:06,000
Okay, maybe I would if it was funny

751
01:00:06,000 --> 01:00:09,000
They're really funny. It would be really funny. I

752
01:00:10,000 --> 01:00:12,000
At least once

753
01:00:12,000 --> 01:00:16,000
I gotta get my family wasn't there. There's been a bit of a pain in the ass

754
01:00:19,000 --> 01:00:21,000
I'm gonna put that on

755
01:00:24,000 --> 01:00:30,000
Merrill what's your favorite dog breed what do you say like I has almost 60

756
01:00:31,000 --> 01:00:33,000
I agree

757
01:00:33,000 --> 01:00:35,000
Yeah, what's your favorite dog breed

758
01:00:35,000 --> 01:00:37,000
Oh, they all good qualities about them

759
01:00:42,000 --> 01:00:45,000
I think a husky is like the most attractive dog how to crit

760
01:00:46,000 --> 01:00:51,000
Wouldn't you say I agree is pretty nice looking yeah, but they're like

761
01:00:52,000 --> 01:00:54,000
Jerks this is you wouldn't actually like want one

762
01:00:56,000 --> 01:01:00,000
Wow, I'm really the judge has a husky and is like upset that you said that

763
01:01:00,000 --> 01:01:02,000
Hey, my friend had huskies growing up

764
01:01:03,000 --> 01:01:05,000
Your chucks. Oh, so all huskies are jerks

765
01:01:06,000 --> 01:01:08,000
Yeah, pretty much

766
01:01:08,000 --> 01:01:10,000
I watched animal planet

767
01:01:11,000 --> 01:01:13,000
Well, what was your favorite show on animal planet

768
01:01:14,000 --> 01:01:16,000
The show about dog breeds obviously

769
01:01:18,000 --> 01:01:25,000
Oh, is there a centric down here? This probably was centered down here right has to be right. I guess not no all the dog lower, okay

770
01:01:25,000 --> 01:01:27,000
Oh

771
01:01:27,000 --> 01:01:29,000
Huskies are trained to like pull things

772
01:01:30,000 --> 01:01:35,000
So in order to for her to stop like stop them for being crazy and just barking all day long

773
01:01:35,000 --> 01:01:39,000
She would have to like get on roller blades and ever huskies tore around the block

774
01:01:40,000 --> 01:01:43,000
I guess like it was just seemed like really badly trained dogs

775
01:01:44,000 --> 01:01:46,000
No, it's like in their genetics

776
01:01:47,000 --> 01:01:51,000
Think about that dogs though if you have a dog that's not trained well

777
01:01:52,000 --> 01:01:55,000
Like dog-a-lead us. Yes, I am. It's hard to uh

778
01:01:56,000 --> 01:01:58,000
With it really doesn't matter what the breed is

779
01:02:00,000 --> 01:02:02,000
If you have a dog that's like not that well trained

780
01:02:03,000 --> 01:02:06,000
There uh probably always going to be an issue unless you can fix it, right?

781
01:02:07,000 --> 01:02:09,000
I know

782
01:02:13,000 --> 01:02:15,000
Yeah, I have to hit them often

783
01:02:16,000 --> 01:02:18,000
Hey

784
01:02:18,000 --> 01:02:20,000
In there

785
01:02:20,000 --> 01:02:22,000
Deposit all 40 in these

786
01:02:22,000 --> 01:02:24,000
That increases the dog's aggression

787
01:02:25,000 --> 01:02:28,000
That's why I totally shit. This is a lot of beers going in here

788
01:02:29,000 --> 01:02:31,000
Also make me hate you

789
01:02:32,000 --> 01:02:34,000
Oh

790
01:02:34,000 --> 01:02:36,000
That was a lot of things deposited

791
01:02:38,000 --> 01:02:40,000
Is that beer icon new?

792
01:02:41,000 --> 01:02:43,000
Yeah, I don't remember that for the last time

793
01:02:43,000 --> 01:02:46,000
I there were a lot of people saying what don't you even do with the beers?

794
01:02:46,000 --> 01:02:50,000
So I guess there's a floating beer and arrow icon now. Yeah, they made it in like two minutes

795
01:02:51,000 --> 01:02:53,000
Beer goes here

796
01:02:54,000 --> 01:02:58,000
Best show on Animal Planet was the show about trying to prove Bigfoot was real

797
01:02:58,000 --> 01:03:01,000
But at the end of the show they were just like we didn't find any evidence

798
01:03:01,000 --> 01:03:03,000
But he could still be out there

799
01:03:03,000 --> 01:03:08,000
Dude you just described shows on like the Discover Channel and the History Channel and Animal Planet

800
01:03:09,000 --> 01:03:11,000
You know Bigfoot could be out there still

801
01:03:12,000 --> 01:03:14,000
No

802
01:03:14,000 --> 01:03:20,000
No, you never know some of the episodes. Yes, I do know like what was the show called like Monster Hunter try

803
01:03:22,000 --> 01:03:24,000
Monster Hunter try

804
01:03:25,000 --> 01:03:31,000
No, the actual show it was like a Monster Hunter show on History Channel like they

805
01:03:31,000 --> 01:03:34,000
I forgot what it was called exactly some of the shows were just like so bad

806
01:03:35,000 --> 01:03:39,000
Like the Bigfoot one that show did an episode on the leprechauns

807
01:03:39,000 --> 01:03:42,000
That's every Bigfoot thing ever they tried to find leprechauns

808
01:03:44,000 --> 01:03:46,000
So I paid them to do it mermaids

809
01:03:46,000 --> 01:03:53,000
They were like reading from ear to ear for the entire episode like yeah for looking for leprech grants

810
01:03:54,000 --> 01:03:57,000
I'm getting such a big paycheck leprechaun

811
01:03:59,000 --> 01:04:01,000
We didn't find any but they could still be real

812
01:04:02,000 --> 01:04:04,000
Let's look up for it all get straight up

813
01:04:04,000 --> 01:04:06,000
Yeah

814
01:04:08,000 --> 01:04:13,000
Yeah, we're gonna win anyways. There's no reasons to just go in like a spree right now. Oh come on

815
01:04:15,000 --> 01:04:17,000
Come on

816
01:04:19,000 --> 01:04:21,000
Come on

817
01:04:22,000 --> 01:04:24,000
Whoa getting scary

818
01:04:28,000 --> 01:04:31,000
All right, I think we've we've got to fill this map

819
01:04:32,000 --> 01:04:34,000
Yeah, Jersey devil is real by the way

820
01:04:36,000 --> 01:04:38,000
About this guy that's

821
01:04:40,000 --> 01:04:43,000
We didn't episode of the Jersey devil and they said we'd go look for it

822
01:04:43,000 --> 01:04:46,000
But we're too scared we already know what's real so we're not gonna we're gonna go to the upper

823
01:04:48,000 --> 01:04:51,000
Jeremy probably need to stop staring at the UFO when you're in the beam

824
01:04:51,000 --> 01:04:54,000
I'm a bug dude. You know like moths. I just have to like stare at it

825
01:04:55,000 --> 01:04:57,000
You know

826
01:04:59,000 --> 01:05:01,000
What's the one that I didn't play the arena map

827
01:05:02,000 --> 01:05:04,000
Brian

828
01:05:04,000 --> 01:05:09,000
Rire buyer rire. I don't know. Can we have a serious talk about your overlay

829
01:05:10,000 --> 01:05:12,000
What's wrong with it?

830
01:05:12,000 --> 01:05:14,000
Can I make you one?

831
01:05:14,000 --> 01:05:19,000
Could it be anything else if you want to make me an overlay it better still have that guy's face

832
01:05:19,000 --> 01:05:21,000
Why?

833
01:05:21,000 --> 01:05:23,000
Why do you need grow on it?

834
01:05:23,000 --> 01:05:27,000
This grow what did you just ask by Grover had to cast to be on there? Yes

835
01:05:28,000 --> 01:05:30,000
Huh

836
01:05:30,000 --> 01:05:32,000
I don't even know where to start

837
01:05:32,000 --> 01:05:36,000
I would say just needs to be animated so people know it's not like offline

838
01:05:38,000 --> 01:05:41,000
I don't know if it's I talking about animated shit

839
01:05:42,000 --> 01:05:50,000
I am an animator I could animate the Grover phase you animate me Grover like I could drink in a milk and being like drink your milk catch

840
01:05:50,000 --> 01:05:53,000
No because that would be a mute reference

841
01:05:54,000 --> 01:05:56,000
That's a mute reference yes he says it all the time

842
01:05:58,000 --> 01:06:01,000
Well that's a growth autobot drink my milk and I drank it

843
01:06:02,000 --> 01:06:05,000
He was on the tie you to drink your milk I don't think you can add sound file to it journal

844
01:06:07,000 --> 01:06:09,000
What do you mean? No it's a word bubble

845
01:06:09,000 --> 01:06:11,000
Add sound to what?

846
01:06:13,000 --> 01:06:15,000
Forget about it

847
01:06:15,000 --> 01:06:17,000
I can envision this in my head

848
01:06:17,000 --> 01:06:19,000
Do you give any superpower to your toilet?

849
01:06:19,000 --> 01:06:21,000
What would it be?

850
01:06:23,000 --> 01:06:25,000
The power to

851
01:06:27,000 --> 01:06:29,000
There is no superpower you give your toilet that is

852
01:06:29,000 --> 01:06:33,000
I would give my toilet mine reading power so it would no one to like open and close because I need it

853
01:06:34,000 --> 01:06:36,000
Yeah, unless it was like an asshole

854
01:06:36,000 --> 01:06:39,000
Who cares though like you can just that that's a one second solution

855
01:06:39,000 --> 01:06:41,000
This is how lazy stories

856
01:06:41,000 --> 01:06:43,000

857
01:06:43,000 --> 01:06:51,000
Um no, I just they would be cool to have a telepathic toilet maybe like everyone's the wildest I don't want my toilet to be sentient

858
01:06:51,000 --> 01:06:53,000

01:07:04,000 --> 01:07:06,000
No if I had a sentient toilet

863
01:07:06,000 --> 01:07:08,000
Dude what did you eat?

864
01:07:08,000 --> 01:07:09,000
It would just be like

865
01:07:09,000 --> 01:07:09,000
God

866
01:07:10,000 --> 01:07:11,000

867
01:07:11,000 --> 01:07:13,000
Okay just go

868
01:07:13,000 --> 01:07:14,000
Ha ha ha

869
01:07:14,000 --> 01:07:15,000
God damn

870
01:07:15,000 --> 01:07:17,000
And then you'd flush and he'd be like

871
01:07:19,000 --> 01:07:20,000
Oh

872
01:07:22,000 --> 01:07:25,000
You just forced me to swallow that you fucking monster

873
01:07:27,000 --> 01:07:29,000
And then you'd get out of the room you'd close the door and you'd be like

874
01:07:29,000 --> 01:07:30,000
Fuck my god

875
01:07:32,000 --> 01:07:33,000
No I would say to you

876
01:07:33,000 --> 01:07:36,000
Nothing you can do to stop me and I'll be back later

877
01:07:40,000 --> 01:07:42,000
Because it like doesn't have arms

878
01:07:42,000 --> 01:07:43,000
It can't move

879
01:07:44,000 --> 01:07:46,000
And I'm gonna go eat the cutoff fish

880
01:07:50,000 --> 01:07:51,000
What if they puke done you?

881
01:07:51,000 --> 01:07:53,000
That's the thing

882
01:07:55,000 --> 01:07:57,000
But it would just be like crying at night

883
01:07:58,000 --> 01:07:59,000
You'd be like trying to sleep and it would just be like

884
01:07:59,000 --> 01:08:00,000
God

885
01:08:01,000 --> 01:08:03,000
So most disgusting conversation we've ever had

886
01:08:03,000 --> 01:08:05,000
God no you never

887
01:08:05,000 --> 01:08:06,000
You've talked about like

888
01:08:06,000 --> 01:08:08,000
He'd rip out of the wall and start fighting you

889
01:08:08,000 --> 01:08:09,000
Oh my god

890
01:08:12,000 --> 01:08:15,000
You've talked about like bunched up packages and men's pants

891
01:08:18,000 --> 01:08:19,000
And how like

892
01:08:19,000 --> 01:08:21,000
How noticeable it was

893
01:08:21,000 --> 01:08:23,000
This conversation is like a weirder

894
01:08:23,000 --> 01:08:25,000
Bunched up package

895
01:08:25,000 --> 01:08:26,000
Yeah see

896
01:08:27,000 --> 01:08:28,000
You thought it was funny then too

897
01:08:28,000 --> 01:08:31,000
That I just listened to what you just said

898
01:08:31,000 --> 01:08:33,000
Bunched up packages

899
01:08:34,000 --> 01:08:35,000
Yeah

900
01:08:35,000 --> 01:08:37,000
I just think it likes to stick that's

901
01:08:38,000 --> 01:08:39,000
That's funny on its own

902
01:08:39,000 --> 01:08:41,000
Really ergonomic

903
01:08:41,000 --> 01:08:45,000
But I'll draw a grover for you with a bunched up package like animated

904
01:08:47,000 --> 01:08:48,000
For your overlay

905
01:08:48,000 --> 01:08:49,000
How about that?

906
01:08:51,000 --> 01:08:53,000
Shit that's so messed up

907
01:08:54,000 --> 01:08:54,000
Grover

908
01:08:55,000 --> 01:08:56,000
And it's talking to your toilet

909
01:09:00,000 --> 01:09:01,000
Oh boy

910
01:09:02,000 --> 01:09:05,000
No I would not want to have superpowers

911
01:09:05,000 --> 01:09:07,000
I'm watching this while eating

912
01:09:07,000 --> 01:09:08,000
Fuck

913
01:09:08,000 --> 01:09:10,000
I'm sorry

914
01:09:10,000 --> 01:09:11,000
Sorry Bonzi

915
01:09:11,000 --> 01:09:13,000
Have I been played the game yet?

916
01:09:13,000 --> 01:09:14,000
I'm like what have I done anything?

917
01:09:14,000 --> 01:09:16,000
I don't think you've gotten a kill

918
01:09:16,000 --> 01:09:17,000
I am dead serious

919
01:09:17,000 --> 01:09:19,000
Have I just sit on the spawn?

920
01:09:19,000 --> 01:09:20,000
I don't know

921
01:09:20,000 --> 01:09:23,000
I really have no idea if I was just sitting in the spawn

922
01:09:23,000 --> 01:09:24,000
It probably happened

923
01:09:24,000 --> 01:09:27,000
Maybe you had to spectate this round

924
01:09:27,000 --> 01:09:29,000
Because like 12 people have to spectate

925
01:09:32,000 --> 01:09:34,000
I'll be back of late

926
01:09:34,000 --> 01:09:36,000
Oh that is

927
01:09:36,000 --> 01:09:38,000
That is next level stuff

928
01:09:38,000 --> 01:09:40,000
This change the topic is something nicer

929
01:09:40,000 --> 01:09:42,000
Like

930
01:09:42,000 --> 01:09:44,000
What's your favorite plant?

931
01:09:44,000 --> 01:09:46,000
Jesus

932
01:09:46,000 --> 01:09:48,000
What's your favorite plant?

933
01:09:48,000 --> 01:09:50,000
Why I had to hit me in the face right there

934
01:09:50,000 --> 01:09:52,000
Plant from Nukulu Throne

935
01:09:52,000 --> 01:09:54,000
Is it good to answer?

936
01:09:54,000 --> 01:09:56,000
My favorite plant is probably a snap dragon

937
01:09:56,000 --> 01:09:58,000
I answered

938
01:09:58,000 --> 01:10:00,000
Why?

939
01:10:01,000 --> 01:10:02,000
What?

940
01:10:02,000 --> 01:10:04,000
Snap dragon

941
01:10:04,000 --> 01:10:05,000
You don't know what a snap dragon is?

942
01:10:05,000 --> 01:10:07,000
You answered that so quick

943
01:10:07,000 --> 01:10:09,000
Because that's my favorite plant

944
01:10:09,000 --> 01:10:11,000
Do you know what your favorite plant is?

945
01:10:11,000 --> 01:10:13,000
No

946
01:10:13,000 --> 01:10:15,000
Her plant is her

947
01:10:15,000 --> 01:10:17,000
Plant

948
01:10:17,000 --> 01:10:19,000
Oh

949
01:10:21,000 --> 01:10:23,000
My favorite plant is a snap dragon

950
01:10:23,000 --> 01:10:25,000
I can't get over it

951
01:10:25,000 --> 01:10:27,000
I can't get over the toilet

952
01:10:27,000 --> 01:10:29,000
God

953
01:10:29,000 --> 01:10:31,000
It's gonna be with me for a while

954
01:10:31,000 --> 01:10:33,000
The guy in chat asked a really good question

955
01:10:33,000 --> 01:10:35,000
It's the toilet clog as if it choked and died

956
01:10:35,000 --> 01:10:37,000
No

957
01:10:37,000 --> 01:10:39,000
They have to pee in a dead toilet

958
01:10:39,000 --> 01:10:41,000
Jesus

959
01:10:41,000 --> 01:10:43,000
Say what chapter already

960
01:10:43,000 --> 01:10:45,000
Alright, now let's see what we're gonna spectate

961
01:10:45,000 --> 01:10:47,000
We're gonna spectate

962
01:10:47,000 --> 01:10:49,000
Thought Jermy would say sunflower

963
01:10:49,000 --> 01:10:51,000
You have to give your toilet

964
01:10:51,000 --> 01:10:53,000
That is one funny good point

965
01:10:53,000 --> 01:10:55,000
Very good point

966
01:10:55,000 --> 01:10:57,000
Have you ever mentioned sunflowers before or something

967
01:10:57,000 --> 01:10:59,000
No, no, like they're just really really big and cool looking

968
01:10:59,000 --> 01:11:01,000
It's personally, it was you pretty well

969
01:11:01,000 --> 01:11:03,000
Impress us, Shell

970
01:11:03,000 --> 01:11:05,000
Get this, come on, get that sniper

971
01:11:05,000 --> 01:11:07,000
That's you are kill

972
01:11:07,000 --> 01:11:09,000
You gotta get that

973
01:11:09,000 --> 01:11:11,000
Dude, this is the whole team right here

974
01:11:11,000 --> 01:11:13,000
They don't even know

975
01:11:13,000 --> 01:11:15,000
We're gonna spectate

976
01:11:15,000 --> 01:11:17,000
Alright, this guy

977
01:11:17,000 --> 01:11:19,000
Alright, no, we're gonna

978
01:11:19,000 --> 01:11:21,000
Okay

979
01:11:21,000 --> 01:11:23,000
You got this, you're gonna go in there

980
01:11:23,000 --> 01:11:25,000
And you're gonna be the laggiest guy in this whole server

981
01:11:25,000 --> 01:11:27,000
He got him

982
01:11:27,000 --> 01:11:29,000
The chat is being silly

983
01:11:29,000 --> 01:11:31,000
He got him

984
01:11:31,000 --> 01:11:33,000
The chat is being silly

985
01:11:33,000 --> 01:11:35,000
He got him

986
01:11:35,000 --> 01:11:41,000
Tell Star that they do make toilets with sensors that will lift the lid when you get near it

987
01:11:41,000 --> 01:11:43,000
I like the toilets

988
01:11:43,000 --> 01:11:45,000
I've never gonna try one

989
01:11:45,000 --> 01:11:47,000
Go go and new plan toilet that like spits in your asshole

990
01:11:47,000 --> 01:11:49,000
Ah

991
01:11:49,000 --> 01:11:53,000
I'm really curious

992
01:11:53,000 --> 01:11:55,000
That's a lot

993
01:11:55,000 --> 01:11:57,000
The one apartment we looked at had one of those toilets

994
01:11:57,000 --> 01:11:59,000
That's what it's been

995
01:11:59,000 --> 01:12:03,000
Yeah, that one that had the fish smells that had that had one of those toilets

996
01:12:03,000 --> 01:12:05,000
Oh, gross, I'm so glad we didn't go there then

997
01:12:05,000 --> 01:12:07,000
You have to do it

998
01:12:07,000 --> 01:12:11,000
Yes, you do, you have to do it at least once

999
01:12:11,000 --> 01:12:13,000
You do

1000
01:12:13,000 --> 01:12:15,000
You really do

1001
01:12:15,000 --> 01:12:17,000
You really do

1002
01:12:19,000 --> 01:12:21,000
Oh, we got it

1003
01:12:21,000 --> 01:12:23,000
We got it

1004
01:12:23,000 --> 01:12:25,000
I'm so glad I avoided that

1005
01:12:25,000 --> 01:12:27,000
I know

1006
01:12:27,000 --> 01:12:31,000
I don't think I mean fish apartment

1007
01:12:31,000 --> 01:12:33,000
I don't know, I'm trying to think of like

1008
01:12:33,000 --> 01:12:35,000
If it wasn't Snapdragon

1009
01:12:37,000 --> 01:12:39,000
Cactus

1010
01:12:39,000 --> 01:12:43,000
And I'm not talking like the little cactus that your doctor has in his office

1011
01:12:43,000 --> 01:12:47,000
I'm talking about the big ass Wily Coyote cactus

1012
01:12:47,000 --> 01:12:49,000
The Super Mario cactus with the arms that stick up

1013
01:12:49,000 --> 01:12:51,000
That's my second favorite plant

1014
01:12:51,000 --> 01:12:53,000
I like how long between talking about plants

1015
01:12:53,000 --> 01:12:55,000
You brought it back up again

1016
01:12:55,000 --> 01:12:57,000
So Sunflower is number three

1017
01:12:57,000 --> 01:12:59,000
I just walked right into a heavy by the way

1018
01:12:59,000 --> 01:13:01,000
Oh, I journaled Love Walk red

1019
01:13:01,000 --> 01:13:03,000
I just snapped dragons and cactus is

1020
01:13:03,000 --> 01:13:05,000
And he's a really big plant guy

1021
01:13:05,000 --> 01:13:09,000
How do redwoods factor in your plant discussion

1022
01:13:09,000 --> 01:13:11,000
Redwoods?

1023
01:13:11,000 --> 01:13:13,000
Yes

1024
01:13:13,000 --> 01:13:15,000
The tree redwood

1025
01:13:15,000 --> 01:13:17,000
Yes, is it a plant actually

1026
01:13:17,000 --> 01:13:19,000
Yeah

1027
01:13:19,000 --> 01:13:21,000
You had the largest plant on the planet

1028
01:13:21,000 --> 01:13:23,000
Yeah, that's what I think about them

1029
01:13:23,000 --> 01:13:27,000
I thought that would have been

1030
01:13:27,000 --> 01:13:29,000
Well, it's your favorite animal

1031
01:13:29,000 --> 01:13:31,000
Non-domestic animal

1032
01:13:31,000 --> 01:13:33,000
You're gonna say like

1033
01:13:33,000 --> 01:13:35,000
I got it

1034
01:13:35,000 --> 01:13:37,000
I'm a good one

1035
01:13:37,000 --> 01:13:39,000
That's a really good one

1036
01:13:39,000 --> 01:13:41,000
Do you have an armadilist of pet if you could

1037
01:13:41,000 --> 01:13:45,000
If it was like legal and they weren't like a wild animal maybe

1038
01:13:45,000 --> 01:13:47,000
Okay

1039
01:13:47,000 --> 01:13:51,000
Yes, and it has the flame on powers

1040
01:13:51,000 --> 01:13:53,000
Just get ahead, Shawn, like this thing

1041
01:13:53,000 --> 01:13:55,000
With the human flame

1042
01:13:55,000 --> 01:13:57,000
Do you tell me it's got human flame powers

1043
01:13:57,000 --> 01:13:59,000
There's no human flame

1044
01:13:59,000 --> 01:14:01,000
I need to stop talking so I can get a kill

1045
01:14:01,000 --> 01:14:03,000
There's so many lengths of fiction

1046
01:14:03,000 --> 01:14:05,000
One burning toilet

1047
01:14:05,000 --> 01:14:07,000
I would not want that toilet

1048
01:14:07,000 --> 01:14:09,000
Should I click on it or no?

1049
01:14:09,000 --> 01:14:11,000
Yes, should

1050
01:14:11,000 --> 01:14:13,000
You're almost should click on it too

1051
01:14:13,000 --> 01:14:15,000
God, that guy again

1052
01:14:15,000 --> 01:14:17,000
Ew

1053
01:14:17,000 --> 01:14:19,000
Give me a break

1054
01:14:19,000 --> 01:14:21,000
Ew, ew, oh I am seeing that it all of my dreams

1055
01:14:21,000 --> 01:14:23,000
I'm not clicking on any of that shit

1056
01:14:23,000 --> 01:14:25,000
Ah

1057
01:14:25,000 --> 01:14:27,000
I'm clicking on it

1058
01:14:27,000 --> 01:14:29,000
She's overreacting, she's trying to get more subscribers

1059
01:14:29,000 --> 01:14:31,000
She's never clicking on that

1060
01:14:31,000 --> 01:14:33,000
Don't try to get me to click on that

1061
01:14:33,000 --> 01:14:35,000
Who linked that

1062
01:14:35,000 --> 01:14:39,000
No, it's really it's

1063
01:14:39,000 --> 01:14:41,000
It's not gory

1064
01:14:41,000 --> 01:14:45,000
This is a g-rated stream guys

1065
01:14:45,000 --> 01:14:47,000
Yes, more like that

1066
01:14:47,000 --> 01:14:49,000
This is a general g-rated audio stream

1067
01:14:49,000 --> 01:14:51,000
Okay, I don't want to see that shit

1068
01:14:53,000 --> 01:14:55,000
Get that fucking dumb shit out of here

1069
01:14:55,000 --> 01:14:57,000
G-rated, come on guys

1070
01:14:57,000 --> 01:14:59,000
Is you saying the word shit?

1071
01:14:59,000 --> 01:15:01,000
That's what Jokey's trying to make

1072
01:15:01,000 --> 01:15:03,000
He really stressed it

1073
01:15:03,000 --> 01:15:07,000
You really want to make sure people call on to the joke there

1074
01:15:07,000 --> 01:15:09,000
Can I play again?

1075
01:15:09,000 --> 01:15:11,000
No

1076
01:15:11,000 --> 01:15:13,000
I'm gonna show you guys my

1077
01:15:13,000 --> 01:15:15,000
Why are you playing arena on the stream?

1078
01:15:15,000 --> 01:15:17,000
Because it gives me, you know why?

1079
01:15:17,000 --> 01:15:19,000
Because it gives me a chance to talk

1080
01:15:19,000 --> 01:15:21,000
You're always dead

1081
01:15:21,000 --> 01:15:23,000
When I'm dead, I can just be like, all right, let's talk about plants

1082
01:15:23,000 --> 01:15:25,000
All right, did you see my last round?

1083
01:15:25,000 --> 01:15:27,000
I got like three or four people in the last round

1084
01:15:27,000 --> 01:15:29,000
You like surviving arena

1085
01:15:29,000 --> 01:15:31,000
I'm sorry

1086
01:15:31,000 --> 01:15:33,000
I'm sorry

1087
01:15:33,000 --> 01:15:35,000
I got like three or four people in the last round

1088
01:15:35,000 --> 01:15:37,000
You like surviving arena

1089
01:15:37,000 --> 01:15:39,000
It's different

1090
01:15:39,000 --> 01:15:41,000
Did you just see the round that I just played in scouting?

1091
01:15:41,000 --> 01:15:43,000
I got like four people

1092
01:15:43,000 --> 01:15:45,000
Who's your favorite?

1093
01:15:45,000 --> 01:15:47,000
Watching the stream

1094
01:15:47,000 --> 01:15:49,000
Right now you're equipping a sniper loadout

1095
01:15:49,000 --> 01:15:51,000
I know

1096
01:15:51,000 --> 01:15:53,000
Isn't it different than Wackig or

1097
01:15:53,000 --> 01:15:55,000
Hutspin sniper

1098
01:15:55,000 --> 01:15:57,000
You know it

1099
01:15:57,000 --> 01:15:59,000
The control point is being captured

1100
01:15:59,000 --> 01:16:01,000
I think we did it

1101
01:16:01,000 --> 01:16:03,000
Look at that

1102
01:16:03,000 --> 01:16:05,000
You know it sucks

1103
01:16:05,000 --> 01:16:07,000
I wish the final shot

1104
01:16:13,000 --> 01:16:15,000
I knew it would be a good game

1105
01:16:15,000 --> 01:16:17,000
I knew it would be a good game

1106
01:16:17,000 --> 01:16:19,000
I just ran out of jank

1107
01:16:19,000 --> 01:16:21,000
I have some cool enemies

1108
01:16:21,000 --> 01:16:23,000
I have some cool designs

1109
01:16:23,000 --> 01:16:25,000
What was it for?

1110
01:16:25,000 --> 01:16:27,000
A PlayStation

1111
01:16:27,000 --> 01:16:29,000
The PS

1112
01:16:29,000 --> 01:16:31,000
The PS

1113
01:16:31,000 --> 01:16:33,000
PS1, PS2, or PS3

1114
01:16:33,000 --> 01:16:35,000
PS1

1115
01:16:35,000 --> 01:16:37,000
The first

1116
01:16:37,000 --> 01:16:39,000
There were a lot of cool games for PS1

1117
01:16:45,000 --> 01:16:47,000
That was the most random thought

1118
01:16:47,000 --> 01:16:49,000
Hell is going on with this guy

1119
01:16:49,000 --> 01:16:51,000
I'm pretty confused

1120
01:16:51,000 --> 01:16:53,000
I'm as confused as you could be

1121
01:16:53,000 --> 01:16:55,000
I blame that on that medic

1122
01:16:55,000 --> 01:16:57,000
That was civilianing around

1123
01:16:57,000 --> 01:16:59,000
I probably would have

1124
01:16:59,000 --> 01:17:01,000
If I didn't freak out at that, that was weird

1125
01:17:19,000 --> 01:17:21,000
What is another good PlayStation 1

1126
01:17:21,000 --> 01:17:23,000
Classics?

1127
01:17:23,000 --> 01:17:25,000
I was talking to Ashley the other day about a vagrant story

1128
01:17:25,000 --> 01:17:27,000
That's not one of my old time favorites

1129
01:17:27,000 --> 01:17:29,000
Little lesser known like J.P. Koone

1130
01:17:33,000 --> 01:17:35,000
Let's watch this guy

1131
01:17:39,000 --> 01:17:41,000
J.K. Koone

1132
01:17:41,000 --> 01:17:43,000
Resident Evil games

1133
01:17:43,000 --> 01:17:45,000
We're pretty good too

1134
01:17:45,000 --> 01:17:47,000
Wow, did we just both

1135
01:17:47,000 --> 01:17:49,000
Do you owe me a

1136
01:17:49,000 --> 01:17:51,000
Coca-Cola classic?

1137
01:17:51,000 --> 01:17:53,000
Yeah, I'll fuck you

1138
01:17:53,000 --> 01:17:55,000
You did not just say that, did you

1139
01:17:55,000 --> 01:17:57,000
On my G-rated stream

1140
01:17:59,000 --> 01:18:01,000
It would have been a G-rated thing

1141
01:18:01,000 --> 01:18:03,000
Like, you know they don't show anything

1142
01:18:05,000 --> 01:18:07,000
It's just like a fight

1143
01:18:07,000 --> 01:18:09,000
On my G-rated stream

1144
01:18:09,000 --> 01:18:11,000
You're going to bring that up

1145
01:18:11,000 --> 01:18:13,000
Thanks

1146
01:18:13,000 --> 01:18:15,000
Okay, well moving on

1147
01:18:15,000 --> 01:18:17,000
You're okay, you're all

1148
01:18:17,000 --> 01:18:19,000
The old um

1149
01:18:19,000 --> 01:18:21,000
I figured what they were called

1150
01:18:21,000 --> 01:18:23,000
Turn-based mech games

1151
01:18:23,000 --> 01:18:25,000
It wasn't mech warrior

1152
01:18:25,000 --> 01:18:27,000
Turn-based mech game

1153
01:18:27,000 --> 01:18:29,000
Yeah, those are really good

1154
01:18:33,000 --> 01:18:37,000
Did I do it in time?

1155
01:18:37,000 --> 01:18:39,000
Apparently not

1156
01:18:39,000 --> 01:18:45,000
No, I- Mech warrior

1157
01:18:45,000 --> 01:18:47,000
I think it's mech warrior

1158
01:18:47,000 --> 01:18:49,000
That was a old PC game

1159
01:18:49,000 --> 01:18:51,000
Is that no gear

1160
01:18:53,000 --> 01:18:57,000
It has like seven games

1161
01:18:57,000 --> 01:18:59,000
Oh, front mission

1162
01:18:59,000 --> 01:19:01,000
That guy got it, that guy wins

1163
01:19:01,000 --> 01:19:03,000
Okay, why is this shooting out regular pills?

1164
01:19:03,000 --> 01:19:05,000
Everyone who said front mission was a winner

1165
01:19:05,000 --> 01:19:07,000
There's a lot of weird shit going on in this server

1166
01:19:07,000 --> 01:19:09,000
This is the iron bomber

1167
01:19:09,000 --> 01:19:11,000
Why is this shooting regular

1168
01:19:11,000 --> 01:19:13,000
Regular demo man pills

1169
01:19:15,000 --> 01:19:17,000
That's just good to talk

1170
01:19:17,000 --> 01:19:19,000
Okay

1171
01:19:19,000 --> 01:19:21,000
Alrighty then

1172
01:19:21,000 --> 01:19:23,000
Should shoot chickens

1173
01:19:23,000 --> 01:19:25,000
What does it do?

1174
01:19:25,000 --> 01:19:27,000
Armored core as well actually

1175
01:19:27,000 --> 01:19:29,000
You know dark soul people

1176
01:19:29,000 --> 01:19:31,000
It's quite the good game

1177
01:19:31,000 --> 01:19:33,000
I do remember armored core

1178
01:19:33,000 --> 01:19:35,000
I would actually freaking love

1179
01:19:35,000 --> 01:19:37,000
Like PVPU and armored core

1180
01:19:37,000 --> 01:19:39,000
It'd probably fun

1181
01:19:41,000 --> 01:19:43,000
You should uh, you should get it

1182
01:19:43,000 --> 01:19:45,000
I'll come over

1183
01:19:45,000 --> 01:19:47,000
I would have to like unlock all this stuff too

1184
01:19:47,000 --> 01:19:49,000
You have to like make a neck

1185
01:19:49,000 --> 01:19:51,000
But then I'd play-

1186
01:19:51,000 --> 01:19:53,000
You are coming over though, right, Jerm?

1187
01:19:53,000 --> 01:19:55,000
You better come over early so we can do something

1188
01:19:55,000 --> 01:19:57,000
Someday

1189
01:19:57,000 --> 01:19:59,000
What? This doesn't sound like a commitment

1190
01:19:59,000 --> 01:20:01,000
I'll come over like Friday

1191
01:20:01,000 --> 01:20:03,000
Someday

1192
01:20:03,000 --> 01:20:07,000
Yeah, I'm gonna go- I'm gonna go a new server

1193
01:20:07,000 --> 01:20:13,000
This time I'm just gonna do- I'm just gonna do like- I'm just gonna regular just like payload man

1194
01:20:13,000 --> 01:20:15,000
Oh, I'm not convinced

1195
01:20:15,000 --> 01:20:17,000
Then I'm gonna go to payload upward

1196
01:20:17,000 --> 01:20:19,000
Oh, they are gonna come over

1197
01:20:19,000 --> 01:20:25,000
I'll be there in like three days

1198
01:20:25,000 --> 01:20:29,000
This is that aligned with the traffic? It's gonna take you

1199
01:20:29,000 --> 01:20:31,000
Yeah, I'm leaving tomorrow

1200
01:20:31,000 --> 01:20:33,000
You two non-drivers

1201
01:20:33,000 --> 01:20:35,000
Hey

1202
01:20:35,000 --> 01:20:37,000
You two non-vehicle operators?

1203
01:20:37,000 --> 01:20:39,000
I have my driver's license

1204
01:20:39,000 --> 01:20:41,000
Actually that's a good question

1205
01:20:41,000 --> 01:20:43,000
Like what are you- you gonna leave your car

1206
01:20:43,000 --> 01:20:47,000
In like the train station parking lot for like three days?

1207
01:20:47,000 --> 01:20:49,000
That's what you do when you do something

1208
01:20:49,000 --> 01:20:51,000
Do they charge you money?

1209
01:20:51,000 --> 01:20:53,000
Like a lot of money?

1210
01:20:53,000 --> 01:20:55,000
It's like $6,000

1211
01:20:55,000 --> 01:20:57,000
Yeah, just like-

1212
01:20:57,000 --> 01:20:59,000
You come back and it's like full of-

1213
01:20:59,000 --> 01:21:01,000
$1,000?

1214
01:21:01,000 --> 01:21:03,000
No, I know

1215
01:21:05,000 --> 01:21:07,000
I don't know what the heck

1216
01:21:07,000 --> 01:21:09,000
What's going on here?

1217
01:21:11,000 --> 01:21:15,000
All right, we are on a Borneo server now and I'm gonna play-

1218
01:21:15,000 --> 01:21:19,000
Looks like cart heavy

1219
01:21:19,000 --> 01:21:29,000
Oh, like that heavy that sits on the cart

1220
01:21:29,000 --> 01:21:33,000
Is Grover still on?

1221
01:21:33,000 --> 01:21:35,000
Tsk out

1222
01:21:35,000 --> 01:21:37,000
On Sesame Street?

1223
01:21:37,000 --> 01:21:39,000
Yeah, do they still do Grover segments?

1224
01:21:39,000 --> 01:21:41,000
You're asking us

1225
01:21:41,000 --> 01:21:43,000
Yeah

1226
01:21:43,000 --> 01:21:47,000
They still do Sesame Street?

1227
01:21:47,000 --> 01:21:49,000
Yeah, did she hear the news?

1228
01:21:49,000 --> 01:21:51,000
Well, it's a news

1229
01:21:51,000 --> 01:21:53,000
Kermit got a new girlfriend

1230
01:21:53,000 --> 01:21:55,000
Brucker was taking-

1231
01:21:55,000 --> 01:21:57,000
Wow, Kermit's got a new GF

1232
01:21:57,000 --> 01:22:01,000
I read like a forum post that's like he was good

1233
01:22:01,000 --> 01:22:03,000
Because she was like a domestic abuse

1234
01:22:03,000 --> 01:22:05,000
Glad he left her

1235
01:22:05,000 --> 01:22:07,000
She was kind of like into-

1236
01:22:07,000 --> 01:22:11,000
BDS subway talking about like the-

1237
01:22:11,000 --> 01:22:13,000
Yeah

1238
01:22:13,000 --> 01:22:15,000
She did the high-five

1239
01:22:15,000 --> 01:22:17,000
Yeah

1240
01:22:17,000 --> 01:22:19,000
A lot of people

1241
01:22:19,000 --> 01:22:21,000
Frankaz

1242
01:22:21,000 --> 01:22:25,000
Oh Frankaz, that's a big-century can I?

1243
01:22:25,000 --> 01:22:27,000
Cheeseball, let's find out

1244
01:22:27,000 --> 01:22:31,000
That's a good point, and you Kermit is not sesame street

1245
01:22:31,000 --> 01:22:33,000
That's a little muffins

1246
01:22:33,000 --> 01:22:35,000
Wow, okay, it's been a while

1247
01:22:35,000 --> 01:22:39,000
Kermits on, is that what's free sometimes?

1248
01:22:39,000 --> 01:22:43,000
Is it?

1249
01:22:43,000 --> 01:22:47,000
Yeah, isn't Sesame Street the gym-handsome company?

1250
01:22:47,000 --> 01:22:49,000
Well, nothing, they're all owned by-

1251
01:22:49,000 --> 01:22:53,000
Frankaz, that's the connection my brain was making but-

1252
01:22:53,000 --> 01:22:55,000
I don't know, it doesn't count

1253
01:22:55,000 --> 01:22:59,000
You don't know if this is counted, it doesn't count, move on

1254
01:23:01,000 --> 01:23:03,000
It seems to be a whole cut-up to my-

1255
01:23:03,000 --> 01:23:05,000
I told you it shows-

1256
01:23:05,000 --> 01:23:07,000
Can I do a Kermit impression?

1257
01:23:07,000 --> 01:23:09,000
Everybody has a Kermit impression, you don't need to hear mine

1258
01:23:09,000 --> 01:23:11,000
Want to hear mine?

1259
01:23:11,000 --> 01:23:12,000
Yes

1260
01:23:12,000 --> 01:23:14,000
Good

1261
01:23:14,000 --> 01:23:16,000
Um

1262
01:23:16,000 --> 01:23:18,000
Good

1263
01:23:22,000 --> 01:23:24,000
Ah, you can't have Shelby

1264
01:23:24,000 --> 01:23:26,000
Can I just fill down?

1265
01:23:26,000 --> 01:23:28,000
Ah

1266
01:23:28,000 --> 01:23:30,000
Oh, I'm not sure if that's true

1267
01:23:30,000 --> 01:23:40,000
There's a chapter in a book I read about a lady that hallucinated an image of Kermit the Frog in the corner of her vision

1268
01:23:40,000 --> 01:23:42,000
For three months

1269
01:23:42,000 --> 01:23:46,000
It's just like a stationary image of Kermit the Frog

1270
01:23:46,000 --> 01:23:48,000
Like, overlaid on top of what she was looking at

1271
01:23:48,000 --> 01:23:50,000
Was she doing some hard drugs?

1272
01:23:50,000 --> 01:23:52,000
No, it was like a brain condition

1273
01:23:52,000 --> 01:23:54,000
Really?

1274
01:23:54,000 --> 01:23:56,000
Yeah

1275
01:23:56,000 --> 01:23:58,000
Wow, that's- that's pretty insane, geez

1276
01:23:58,000 --> 01:24:02,000
She's like, I don't even like that character, I don't even watch that show, why am I saying that?

1277
01:24:02,000 --> 01:24:08,000
It's really weird what like the brain does when you're like not like unconscious mind, it's really weird

1278
01:24:08,000 --> 01:24:12,000
She said that sometimes he changed like emotions, but like for no discernible reason

1279
01:24:12,000 --> 01:24:14,000
She had a Kermit HUD?

1280
01:24:14,000 --> 01:24:16,000
Pretty much

1281
01:24:16,000 --> 01:24:18,000
No, that's what this guy just

1282
01:24:18,000 --> 01:24:20,000
A Kermit HUD

1283
01:24:20,000 --> 01:24:22,000
Yep, that she couldn't uninstall

1284
01:24:22,000 --> 01:24:26,000
I do I read it's a book called hallucinations, it was really cool

1285
01:24:26,000 --> 01:24:28,000
And she wasn't lying

1286
01:24:28,000 --> 01:24:30,000
Which was proved to how

1287
01:24:30,000 --> 01:24:34,000
Was there a case where some lady woke up one day and knew

1288
01:24:34,000 --> 01:24:36,000
French and she never started it and never knew it before

1289
01:24:36,000 --> 01:24:38,000
She just like had something happen, she had like

1290
01:24:38,000 --> 01:24:40,000
Wow, that sounded like an internet thing

1291
01:24:40,000 --> 01:24:42,000
No, I think that that was a real thing

1292
01:24:42,000 --> 01:24:44,000
Like somebody like had either a brain condition or something

1293
01:24:44,000 --> 01:24:48,000
And they ended up like learning a language that they didn't know

1294
01:24:48,000 --> 01:24:50,000
Somehow

1295
01:24:50,000 --> 01:24:52,000
Swear

1296
01:24:52,000 --> 01:24:54,000
Sounds legit

1297
01:24:54,000 --> 01:24:56,000
Somebody will figure that out

1298
01:24:56,000 --> 01:24:58,000
Sounds legit like a Kermit HUD

1299
01:24:58,000 --> 01:25:00,000
Kermit HUD

1300
01:25:00,000 --> 01:25:02,000
Why am I so cynic, dude, when you've seen as much battle as me

1301
01:25:02,000 --> 01:25:04,000
This guy's gonna hit me

1302
01:25:04,000 --> 01:25:06,000
It's not gonna be nice

1303
01:25:06,000 --> 01:25:10,000
Just go around and have so speak being card heavy but I'm gonna be punch heavy now

1304
01:25:10,000 --> 01:25:12,000
It's easy to transition

1305
01:25:12,000 --> 01:25:14,000
Hey, remember I was gonna be punch heavy?

1306
01:25:14,000 --> 01:25:16,000
Just kidding

1307
01:25:16,000 --> 01:25:18,000
Oh, aww

1308
01:25:18,000 --> 01:25:20,000
I'm gonna be punch heavy

1309
01:25:20,000 --> 01:25:22,000
I'm gonna be punch heavy now

1310
01:25:22,000 --> 01:25:24,000
It's easy to transition

1311
01:25:24,000 --> 01:25:26,000
Hey, remember I was gonna be punch heavy?

1312
01:25:26,000 --> 01:25:28,000
Just kidding

1313
01:25:28,000 --> 01:25:30,000
Oh, aww

1314
01:25:30,000 --> 01:25:34,000
The person just got a French accent?

1315
01:25:34,000 --> 01:25:36,000
Oh, I see

1316
01:25:36,000 --> 01:25:38,000
Thank you, Chad

1317
01:25:38,000 --> 01:25:40,000
So she just woke up one day with a French accent

1318
01:25:40,000 --> 01:25:42,000
That she never had before

1319
01:25:42,000 --> 01:25:44,000
And she just was still

1320
01:25:44,000 --> 01:25:46,000
Yeah, yeah, no, just so just miraculously

1321
01:25:46,000 --> 01:25:48,000
Like God on the news and it was popular

1322
01:25:48,000 --> 01:25:50,000
Fuckin' loser

1323
01:25:50,000 --> 01:25:52,000
You don't know

1324
01:25:52,000 --> 01:25:54,000
There's like the amount of difference

1325
01:25:54,000 --> 01:25:56,000
in those two versions of the story

1326
01:25:56,000 --> 01:26:00,000
They didn't find him last season but they might next season

1327
01:26:00,000 --> 01:26:02,000
There's a million snipers that way

1328
01:26:02,000 --> 01:26:04,000
I'm gonna go this way

1329
01:26:04,000 --> 01:26:06,000
I heard that someone had like a big foot hand

1330
01:26:06,000 --> 01:26:08,000
It's like some muck

1331
01:26:08,000 --> 01:26:10,000
That he sold it and then they lost it

1332
01:26:10,000 --> 01:26:14,000
Oh, I'm busy

1333
01:26:14,000 --> 01:26:16,000
Fuck

1334
01:26:16,000 --> 01:26:18,000
But if me and you ever hit like rock bottom

1335
01:26:18,000 --> 01:26:20,000
Like just everything falls apart

1336
01:26:20,000 --> 01:26:24,000
Do you really want to like dress up and go be bigfoot with me

1337
01:26:24,000 --> 01:26:26,000
Yeah

1338
01:26:26,000 --> 01:26:30,000
Like spend our last amount of money on like a big foot costume

1339
01:26:30,000 --> 01:26:32,000
and just go bigfoot

1340
01:26:32,000 --> 01:26:34,000
One that costs at least like $15 to $20,000

1341
01:26:34,000 --> 01:26:36,000
With like fully animatronic face

1342
01:26:36,000 --> 01:26:38,000
Like the old-missed little move

1343
01:26:38,000 --> 01:26:40,000
Yeah, and like stills on the legs so you can be like 9 feet tall

1344
01:26:40,000 --> 01:26:42,000
Yeah, but we need two of us in the costume for it to work

1345
01:26:42,000 --> 01:26:44,000
But yeah, no, no

1346
01:26:44,000 --> 01:26:46,000
We don't have two Sasquatches

1347
01:26:46,000 --> 01:26:48,000
So people would feel overwhelmed and they wouldn't attack us

1348
01:26:48,000 --> 01:26:52,000
Cause I mean you shoot, you would shoot one Sasquatch

1349
01:26:52,000 --> 01:26:54,000
But when you see another one that can come kill you

1350
01:26:54,000 --> 01:26:56,000
You second guess it

1351
01:26:56,000 --> 01:26:58,000
And like little fake Sasquatch babies

1352
01:26:58,000 --> 01:27:00,000
So people would like no like a little better

1353
01:27:00,000 --> 01:27:02,000
So we've been Sasquatch babies

1354
01:27:02,000 --> 01:27:04,000
I can't even comprehend

1355
01:27:04,000 --> 01:27:06,000
I thought I got backstabbed

1356
01:27:06,000 --> 01:27:08,000
We just shot me in the face

1357
01:27:08,000 --> 01:27:10,000
German, we're making an important plan here

1358
01:27:10,000 --> 01:27:12,000
I'm already showing it at the house

1359
01:27:12,000 --> 01:27:14,000
Yes, I will be the two horse person for Halloween this season

1360
01:27:14,000 --> 01:27:16,000
No, this is not a two horse

1361
01:27:16,000 --> 01:27:18,000
This is your big foot and I'm bigfoot

1362
01:27:18,000 --> 01:27:20,000
We're two bigfoot together out in the woods

1363
01:27:20,000 --> 01:27:22,000
That's horrible, we're doing two horse person

1364
01:27:22,000 --> 01:27:24,000
Oh my god, I'm not doing that

1365
01:27:24,000 --> 01:27:26,000
It's this isn't gonna work

1366
01:27:26,000 --> 01:27:28,000
Which one of you is gonna be the butt

1367
01:27:28,000 --> 01:27:30,000
I ain't being the butt

1368
01:27:30,000 --> 01:27:32,000
I'll tell you right now

1369
01:27:32,000 --> 01:27:34,000
I'm gonna be the brain

1370
01:27:36,000 --> 01:27:40,000
You don't know the Sasquatchin out of me

1371
01:27:40,000 --> 01:27:42,000
Maybe the brain is in the butt

1372
01:27:42,000 --> 01:27:44,000
It's gonna be like a cat dog Sasquatch

1373
01:27:44,000 --> 01:27:46,000
With like two ends to it and no butt

1374
01:27:46,000 --> 01:27:48,000
Two faces

1375
01:27:48,000 --> 01:27:50,000
No, dude

1376
01:27:50,000 --> 01:27:52,000
Okay, so if we do hit rock bottom

1377
01:27:52,000 --> 01:27:54,000
Obviously you're not in on the Sasquatch thing, what do we do?

1378
01:27:56,000 --> 01:27:58,000
Do we, if we hit rock bottom, is that what you're asking?

1379
01:27:58,000 --> 01:28:00,000
Yes, there is nowhere else left for us to go

1380
01:28:00,000 --> 01:28:02,000
Everything is falling apart

1381
01:28:02,000 --> 01:28:04,000
They all have blackmail on us

1382
01:28:04,000 --> 01:28:08,000
There's footage of us killing nuns or something

1383
01:28:08,000 --> 01:28:10,000
Well, then we go be a Sasquatch

1384
01:28:10,000 --> 01:28:12,000
That is my strat

1385
01:28:12,000 --> 01:28:14,000
Okay

1386
01:28:14,000 --> 01:28:16,000
Like people that try and run and like, oh I don't know

1387
01:28:16,000 --> 01:28:18,000
No one's ever gonna catch me, I'm never going to jail

1388
01:28:18,000 --> 01:28:20,000
They never tried to be Sasquatchin for

1389
01:28:20,000 --> 01:28:22,000
Alright, so I think then I'm going to just go

1390
01:28:24,000 --> 01:28:26,000
Work it

1391
01:28:26,000 --> 01:28:28,000
Like, I don't know

1392
01:28:28,000 --> 01:28:30,000
Do I still get to like work it like a record just to make it hard work

1393
01:28:30,000 --> 01:28:34,000
No, rock bottom is like if people find you you will go to jail

1394
01:28:34,000 --> 01:28:38,000
You owe so much money to like the government like you will be in prison

1395
01:28:38,000 --> 01:28:40,000
To like the IRS will launch you

1396
01:28:40,000 --> 01:28:42,000
Because you could not pay all these debts and everything

1397
01:28:42,000 --> 01:28:46,000
I would just, I would make a video and be like, guys

1398
01:28:46,000 --> 01:28:48,000
I'm at rock bottom

1399
01:28:48,000 --> 01:28:50,000
And I only tell you how my plan to get out

1400
01:28:50,000 --> 01:28:52,000
And I would tell like a detailed plan of how I was gonna get out of it

1401
01:28:54,000 --> 01:28:56,000
And I'd be like, I'm gonna do this, I'm gonna get my life together

1402
01:28:56,000 --> 01:29:00,000
I'm gonna do this, and that, what do you want me to say?

1403
01:29:00,000 --> 01:29:02,000
I want you to say yes, I'll be Sasquatch with you

1404
01:29:02,000 --> 01:29:06,000
That's not gonna happen unless we do the two Sasquatch

1405
01:29:06,000 --> 01:29:08,000
I'm not doing two man

1406
01:29:08,000 --> 01:29:10,000
Then you're not going to get a yes from me

1407
01:29:10,000 --> 01:29:14,000
You'd be living the rest of your life in a suit with me, you really want that

1408
01:29:14,000 --> 01:29:15,000
Huh?

1409
01:29:15,000 --> 01:29:18,000
With a suit with no butt, think about that

1410
01:29:18,000 --> 01:29:20,000
That guy not die, I go

1411
01:29:22,000 --> 01:29:24,000
I really feel like our friendships being tested right now

1412
01:29:24,000 --> 01:29:28,000
No, but we could, who said we couldn't get out of the costume?

1413
01:29:28,000 --> 01:29:32,000
Well someone sees us getting out of the costume and it's all blown

1414
01:29:32,000 --> 01:29:36,000
The whole thing is done right

1415
01:29:36,000 --> 01:29:38,000
Do we have to live in the woods, we have to live in the woods is what we're saying

1416
01:29:38,000 --> 01:29:44,000
Yeah, we're pretty much harmits, but we're also dressed as Sasquatches to continue the lore of Sasquatch

1417
01:29:44,000 --> 01:29:46,000
Maybe someone will accidentally shoot us too with like a hunting rifle

1418
01:29:46,000 --> 01:29:52,000
Unless, unless one person in the chat said if you had a male one and a female one, then make one kill you

1419
01:29:52,000 --> 01:29:54,000
That's right

1420
01:29:54,000 --> 01:29:56,000
Is he not just like hope for the species?

1421
01:29:56,000 --> 01:29:58,000
Yeah

1422
01:29:58,000 --> 01:30:04,000
And then maybe your financial trouble would be solved because you could suit or shot you

1423
01:30:04,000 --> 01:30:06,000
Get on that car

1424
01:30:06,000 --> 01:30:08,000
I just don't have rights, but people in Sasquatches do

1425
01:30:08,000 --> 01:30:10,000
I have an idea

1426
01:30:10,000 --> 01:30:12,000
How about we talk about something else?

1427
01:30:14,000 --> 01:30:16,000
You can talk about living toilets again

1428
01:30:16,000 --> 01:30:18,000
How about we talk about something else?

1429
01:30:18,000 --> 01:30:20,000
Way more important than any of this shit that you guys are bringing out

1430
01:30:20,000 --> 01:30:22,000
Where the fuck is Grova?

1431
01:30:22,000 --> 01:30:26,000
If we can't talk about Sasquatches costumes, I think I'm lying nights over here and I have to go

1432
01:30:26,000 --> 01:30:28,000
You can do it with Zezgler's clothes

1433
01:30:32,000 --> 01:30:34,000
Excuse me

1434
01:30:34,000 --> 01:30:36,000
Alright, how fast do you think I can do the flight throw-o?

1435
01:30:44,000 --> 01:30:46,000
I'm not even fast

1436
01:30:46,000 --> 01:30:48,000
Yeah, let's talk about that

1437
01:30:50,000 --> 01:30:54,000
You could make a YouTube channel pretend to be homeless

1438
01:30:54,000 --> 01:30:56,000
But one guy already did that

1439
01:30:56,000 --> 01:31:00,000
How about I just just, how about we just keep doing what we do?

1440
01:31:00,000 --> 01:31:02,000
We're just hanging out playing games and chillin-

1441
01:31:02,000 --> 01:31:06,000
And then at a number of you hit rock bottom and we-

1442
01:31:06,000 --> 01:31:08,000
Yeah

1443
01:31:08,000 --> 01:31:12,000
We just like film themselves laying in dumpsters like guys

1444
01:31:12,000 --> 01:31:14,000
ways

1445
01:31:14,000 --> 01:31:18,000
How do you have a computer to upload these videos fake homeless guy?

1446
01:31:18,000 --> 01:31:20,000
Don't ask

1447
01:31:20,000 --> 01:31:22,000
You go to the library

1448
01:31:22,000 --> 01:31:24,000
Don't tell

1449
01:31:24,000 --> 01:31:26,000
Let's try this again

1450
01:31:26,000 --> 01:31:28,000
And then after that he would upload videos of him eating sushi

1451
01:31:28,000 --> 01:31:36,000
she like haha you mad. Fastest clicker in the west. See me in cookie clicker.

1452
01:31:36,000 --> 01:31:42,000
It's trying to be popular. I really recommend that HUD German.

1453
01:31:42,000 --> 01:31:47,000
The Kermit HUD. It's the picture of Kermit and like no other information.

1454
01:31:47,000 --> 01:31:52,000
I clicked way too many times and I lost my ability to click.

1455
01:31:52,000 --> 01:32:02,000
What's your favorite fast food? Like McDonald's hamburger world burger king.

1456
01:32:02,000 --> 01:32:05,000
I'm gonna be a finagle bagel. What?

1457
01:32:05,000 --> 01:32:08,000
It's fin- bagels. Those are really strike knees what you call fast food.

1458
01:32:08,000 --> 01:32:13,000
That is faster than hell dude. It is a finagle bagel.

1459
01:32:13,000 --> 01:32:16,000
The bagel is fast food. Oh shit. Oh I don't have it equipped.

1460
01:32:16,000 --> 01:32:20,000
Right now finagle bagel is my favorite place to like eat in the world.

1461
01:32:20,000 --> 01:32:25,000
Oh then I guess yes. Got my wisdom teeth removed. Got some oxy so I'm high.

1462
01:32:27,000 --> 01:32:30,000
I just fucking- what is- are you serious?

1463
01:32:31,000 --> 01:32:34,000
That was the quickest my guys ever died turning a corner.

1464
01:32:35,000 --> 01:32:40,000
They take- they crack eggs beforehand and they put them in a drawer and they take out the eggs

1465
01:32:40,000 --> 01:32:43,000
and put them on sandwich. Hey be careful with those things man.

1466
01:32:44,000 --> 01:32:47,000
They put eggs in a drawer. Oh what was- what was doing real real talk for a second?

1467
01:32:47,000 --> 01:32:52,000
Be careful with that shit. Look shit. Like taking like the medicine from

1468
01:32:52,000 --> 01:32:54,000
you know the dentist when you get your wisdom teeth out.

1469
01:32:54,000 --> 01:32:59,000
Be careful just- there's no- no what- what it is be educated on it and just be-

1470
01:32:59,000 --> 01:33:04,000
take care of yourself you know. I'm not meant to cut me off of my pain missed.

1471
01:33:04,000 --> 01:33:08,000
All right that's the second time that's happened. I was like wow it's still hurt.

1472
01:33:08,000 --> 01:33:12,000
That's the second time I've insta- died by this guy. She had no mercy.

1473
01:33:13,000 --> 01:33:14,000
Holy shit.

1474
01:33:18,000 --> 01:33:23,000
I don't feel like that hunt would benefit if- what- which hunt? You're the one that you use?

1475
01:33:23,000 --> 01:33:27,000
Yeah. She's getting- just getting some hunt vibes.

1476
01:33:33,000 --> 01:33:34,000
A lot of people over there.

1477
01:33:34,000 --> 01:33:36,000
Oh dude, cheesecake back to you.

1478
01:33:38,000 --> 01:33:40,000
She's- cheesecake factory blows.

1479
01:33:40,000 --> 01:33:43,000
I know that's why you're not the perfect man.

1480
01:33:43,000 --> 01:33:44,000
Why? You don't like cheesecake?

1481
01:33:45,000 --> 01:33:46,000
Because he doesn't like it.

1482
01:33:46,000 --> 01:33:49,000
The cheesecake- the cheesecake's been a cheesecake factory.

1483
01:33:49,000 --> 01:33:52,000
I- I'm not going to contest that. I haven't tried it. Maybe it is.

1484
01:33:52,000 --> 01:33:53,000
But like as a restaurant-

1485
01:33:53,000 --> 01:33:55,000
Oh no wait wait wait wait wait. Well back up a second.

1486
01:33:55,000 --> 01:33:59,000
You're- you just said cheesecake the cheesecake factory blows.

1487
01:34:00,000 --> 01:34:05,000
And you have not eaten the cheesecake from the cheesecake factory.

1488
01:34:05,000 --> 01:34:11,000
As a restaurant experience where you sit down and eat and have food it's extremely mediocre.

1489
01:34:12,000 --> 01:34:13,000
Do you remember why it's mediocre?

1490
01:34:13,000 --> 01:34:15,000
Do you know what- do you know what the name of the restaurant is?

1491
01:34:17,000 --> 01:34:18,000
Cheesecake Factory.

1492
01:34:18,000 --> 01:34:19,000
Okay.

1493
01:34:19,000 --> 01:34:22,000
No no no. Do you remember why you didn't like the restaurant?

1494
01:34:22,000 --> 01:34:25,000
Because all of the food is extremely mediocre at that point.

1495
01:34:25,000 --> 01:34:30,000
No. Because the decoration was too fancy and it made you feel self-conscious.

1496
01:34:32,000 --> 01:34:32,000
That's-

1497
01:34:32,000 --> 01:34:32,000
That's-

1498
01:34:32,000 --> 01:34:33,000
That's-

1499
01:34:33,000 --> 01:34:34,000
Okay.

1500
01:34:34,000 --> 01:34:40,000
I don't like that cheesecake factory usually is a fancy establishment for how bad their food is.

1501
01:34:41,000 --> 01:34:42,000
How am I goodness?

1502
01:34:42,000 --> 01:34:43,000
All right.

1503
01:34:43,000 --> 01:34:46,000
Red conning it to have something to do with the actual food.

1504
01:34:47,000 --> 01:34:51,000
And no because the first time we went to one it was really fancy and I was like in a t-shirt and

1505
01:34:51,000 --> 01:34:55,000
it was weird. So I guess I was self-conscious. I was like maybe I should have worn some clothes.

1506
01:34:56,000 --> 01:34:58,000
But you didn't put my pants on me so I didn't.

1507
01:34:59,000 --> 01:35:01,000
Yep. Sorry.

1508
01:35:03,000 --> 01:35:03,000
Well-

1509
01:35:04,000 --> 01:35:06,000
Every day I keep forgetting to put your pants on you.

1510
01:35:07,000 --> 01:35:08,000
I want to just go without-

1511
01:35:08,000 --> 01:35:09,000
I don't think of what like my uh-

1512
01:35:11,000 --> 01:35:14,000
It's my favorite like a restaurant. That's like a chain restaurant. I don't know.

1513
01:35:15,000 --> 01:35:16,000
Isn't it Mose?

1514
01:35:17,000 --> 01:35:19,000
No, no, no, no. I mean like a siss down restaurant. You know what I mean?

1515
01:35:19,000 --> 01:35:21,000
You're sitting down with friends and family.

1516
01:35:24,000 --> 01:35:24,000
Friends.

1517
01:35:26,000 --> 01:35:29,000
I don't know why I spilled that teleport when we're like all the way up here.

1518
01:35:34,000 --> 01:35:35,000
I can't even like-

1519
01:35:35,000 --> 01:35:36,000
I'm gonna go one.

1520
01:35:37,000 --> 01:35:38,000
I feel like maybe I'll-

1521
01:35:38,000 --> 01:35:39,000
I'm gonna go one more time.

1522
01:35:39,000 --> 01:35:40,000
I'm gonna go one more time.

1523
01:35:40,000 --> 01:35:41,000
Phillips.

1524
01:35:41,000 --> 01:35:43,000
I think is the name of the place.

1525
01:35:43,000 --> 01:35:43,000
Phillips.

1526
01:35:43,000 --> 01:35:44,000
What?

1527
01:35:44,000 --> 01:35:47,000
Phillips. It's like a seafood place. There's a couple of them.

1528
01:35:47,000 --> 01:35:48,000
I think that would count as a chain.

1529
01:35:48,000 --> 01:35:50,000
There's one in the airport.

1530
01:35:50,000 --> 01:35:50,000
Whoa.

1531
01:35:50,000 --> 01:35:52,000
I did not expect there to be that many people here.

1532
01:35:52,000 --> 01:35:53,000
But that's awesome.

1533
01:35:53,000 --> 01:35:54,000
What about the clips you like it?

1534
01:35:54,000 --> 01:35:56,000
Yeah, the clips is awesome.

1535
01:35:56,000 --> 01:35:58,000
That dude- that dude's killed me every time I've been alive.

1536
01:35:58,000 --> 01:35:59,000
Dude, I hop-

1537
01:36:00,000 --> 01:36:01,000
That's another good answer.

1538
01:36:01,000 --> 01:36:07,000
This is the first reference to ever liking seafood that wasn't lobster macaroni I've ever heard.

1539
01:36:07,000 --> 01:36:10,000
Well, maybe you'll hear me say Phillips is good

1540
01:36:11,000 --> 01:36:12,000
if we're ever-

1541
01:36:12,000 --> 01:36:13,000
ever knew him.

1542
01:36:14,000 --> 01:36:14,000
Weird.

1543
01:36:14,000 --> 01:36:16,000
I'm like married to you.

1544
01:36:16,000 --> 01:36:17,000
I didn't just-

1545
01:36:17,000 --> 01:36:19,000
I never heard about this Phillips guy.

1546
01:36:19,000 --> 01:36:22,000
I don't know. I don't know where any are besides there's one in

1547
01:36:22,000 --> 01:36:23,000
Ocean City, Maryland.

1548
01:36:23,000 --> 01:36:24,000
And I went to a lot.

1549
01:36:26,000 --> 01:36:28,000
I guess it's like Rackere though those pits.

1550
01:36:29,000 --> 01:36:30,000
I don't know how to-

1551
01:36:30,000 --> 01:36:30,000
Salamari.

1552
01:36:32,000 --> 01:36:33,000
You like call him Ari.

1553
01:36:34,000 --> 01:36:34,000
No.

1554
01:36:36,000 --> 01:36:36,000
No.

1555
01:36:36,000 --> 01:36:37,000
And-

1556
01:36:37,000 --> 01:36:37,000
And-

1557
01:36:39,000 --> 01:36:41,000
What's a lobster macaroni?

1558
01:36:41,000 --> 01:36:41,000
It's too many people.

1559
01:36:42,000 --> 01:36:43,000
Delicious is what it is.

1560
01:36:43,000 --> 01:36:44,000
It's an Uber.

1561
01:36:44,000 --> 01:36:45,000
Yeah.

1562
01:36:46,000 --> 01:36:47,000
Phillips sold out.

1563
01:36:47,000 --> 01:36:49,000
Only experience I really do have with Phillips is from

1564
01:36:50,000 --> 01:36:54,000
Ocean City, Maryland, which is probably their best establishment just based on

1565
01:36:54,000 --> 01:36:56,000
a location standpoint.

1566
01:36:56,000 --> 01:36:57,000
Oh, spy. I'd be a hero here.

1567
01:36:59,000 --> 01:36:59,000
Ben-Brian.

1568
01:36:59,000 --> 01:37:01,000
When was Stir in Ocean City?

1569
01:37:01,000 --> 01:37:02,000
Didn't you go a lot?

1570
01:37:03,000 --> 01:37:04,000
Uh, for-

1571
01:37:04,000 --> 01:37:06,000
I went like every year for three years.

1572
01:37:06,000 --> 01:37:07,000
What the fuck is that?

1573
01:37:07,000 --> 01:37:07,000
Vacation.

1574
01:37:07,000 --> 01:37:08,000
As a young and-

1575
01:37:09,000 --> 01:37:11,000
Because you can't say no to family vacations.

1576
01:37:12,000 --> 01:37:12,000
Yep.

1577
01:37:12,000 --> 01:37:13,000
I'm gonna plan- I'm gonna plan-

1578
01:37:13,000 --> 01:37:14,000
Upward.

1579
01:37:15,000 --> 01:37:16,000
I'm gonna plan upward.

1580
01:37:19,000 --> 01:37:19,000
I'd go again.

1581
01:37:19,000 --> 01:37:21,000
I actually really like Ocean City.

1582
01:37:23,000 --> 01:37:24,000
Does it have dip and dots?

1583
01:37:25,000 --> 01:37:27,000
Has the Guinness Book of World Records like museum?

1584
01:37:28,000 --> 01:37:31,000
There's a window at the beginning where it like makes you like look at the

1585
01:37:31,000 --> 01:37:34,000
window or this mirror or something?

1586
01:37:34,000 --> 01:37:35,000
It's like a mirror.

1587
01:37:35,000 --> 01:37:36,000
You'd have to like-

1588
01:37:36,000 --> 01:37:37,000
It gives you some instruction.

1589
01:37:37,000 --> 01:37:39,000
You have to squint at it or something.

1590
01:37:39,000 --> 01:37:41,000
And when you get all the way to the end of the museum,

1591
01:37:41,000 --> 01:37:44,000
you come all the way around and you get to look at the idiots in the mirror

1592
01:37:44,000 --> 01:37:46,000
because you can see through it.

1593
01:37:46,000 --> 01:37:47,000
Now you're in it for me.

1594
01:37:47,000 --> 01:37:48,000
Yeah.

1595
01:37:48,000 --> 01:37:49,000
Thanks.

1596
01:37:49,000 --> 01:37:50,000
Why are we doing Ocean City?

1597
01:37:50,000 --> 01:37:53,000
I wouldn't let you be the person, the idiot, looking in the mirror.

1598
01:37:53,000 --> 01:37:55,000
Oh, that's nice of you.

1599
01:37:55,000 --> 01:37:56,000
I just said it.

1600
01:37:56,000 --> 01:37:56,000
Just be honest.

1601
01:37:56,000 --> 01:37:58,000
Tricky, we're on this.

1602
01:37:58,000 --> 01:37:59,000
Oh yeah, it is for it please.

1603
01:37:59,000 --> 01:37:59,000
We're on.

1604
01:37:59,000 --> 01:38:00,000
Bad water.

1605
01:38:00,000 --> 01:38:03,000
I don't think I ever actually went in it.

1606
01:38:03,000 --> 01:38:06,000
I just heard a lot of people who had gone in it.

1607
01:38:07,000 --> 01:38:08,000
Dip and dots.

1608
01:38:08,000 --> 01:38:09,000
Dip and dots please.

1609
01:38:10,000 --> 01:38:11,000
Dude, I'm-

1610
01:38:11,000 --> 01:38:15,000
I'm- I'm ready for my yearly serving, my yearly spoonful of dip and dots.

1611
01:38:17,000 --> 01:38:20,000
I cousin ate dip and dots one dot of the time and I just-

1612
01:38:21,000 --> 01:38:24,000
I can't contain myself when I have dip and dots.

1613
01:38:24,000 --> 01:38:25,000
I eat them so fast.

1614
01:38:25,000 --> 01:38:26,000
I know.

1615
01:38:27,000 --> 01:38:28,000
I could eat that all day.

1616
01:38:29,000 --> 01:38:31,000
Remember when we were looking into like ordering dip and dots

1617
01:38:31,000 --> 01:38:33,000
from the internet and the whole day?

1618
01:38:33,000 --> 01:38:34,000
Where you could get it was like-

1619
01:38:34,000 --> 01:38:35,000
It's that free as dried and everything.

1620
01:38:35,000 --> 01:38:39,000
In dry ice crates, do you end up by like five gallons of-

1621
01:38:40,000 --> 01:38:42,000
Or your birthday party?

1622
01:38:42,000 --> 01:38:43,000
No, two of you.

1623
01:38:43,000 --> 01:38:43,000
It's so worth it.

1624
01:38:44,000 --> 01:38:46,000
What's dip and dots?

1625
01:38:46,000 --> 01:38:47,000
What's dip and dots?

1626
01:38:48,000 --> 01:38:50,000
It has like three bucks a dot, though they are.

1627
01:38:50,000 --> 01:38:56,000
Actually, that ice cream you got, it's also very, very top-tiered ice cream.

1628
01:38:56,000 --> 01:38:56,000
Really?

1629
01:38:56,000 --> 01:38:58,000
It's comparable to dip and dots.

1630
01:38:59,000 --> 01:39:01,000
It's comparable to maybe the best ice cream I've had.

1631
01:39:04,000 --> 01:39:06,000
The best ice cream I've ever had probably really was-

1632
01:39:08,000 --> 01:39:09,000
I don't know, I want to say it's like-

1633
01:39:10,000 --> 01:39:13,000
If you go to like an actual Ben and Jerry's store,

1634
01:39:14,000 --> 01:39:16,000
not like go to the supermarket and get the pint.

1635
01:39:16,000 --> 01:39:19,000
If there's like a Ben and Jerry's ice cream place,

1636
01:39:20,000 --> 01:39:20,000
they're-

1637
01:39:20,000 --> 01:39:21,000
They're-

1638
01:39:21,000 --> 01:39:26,000
Um, they're double fudge like fudge chocolate brownie ice cream.

1639
01:39:26,000 --> 01:39:27,000
Oh my god.

1640
01:39:28,000 --> 01:39:29,000
With a huge fudge chunks.

1641
01:39:31,000 --> 01:39:31,000
It's like-

1642
01:39:31,000 --> 01:39:32,000
Huge!

1643
01:39:32,000 --> 01:39:34,000
It's like eating a brownie and like a milkshake and-

1644
01:39:34,000 --> 01:39:37,000
It's just everything that's amazing about the world and life in general.

1645
01:39:41,000 --> 01:39:43,000
Pinkberry, shot, pinkberry.

1646
01:39:43,000 --> 01:39:43,000
It's sponsored me.

1647
01:39:47,000 --> 01:39:48,000
Pinkberry's cool.

1648
01:39:48,000 --> 01:39:50,000
What if like Mr. Pinkberry wasn't chat right now?

1649
01:39:51,000 --> 01:39:52,000
Did you freak out?

1650
01:39:52,000 --> 01:39:55,000
I would decline the sponsorship and say what you think.

1651
01:39:56,000 --> 01:39:57,000
Because it's not pinkberry?

1652
01:39:58,000 --> 01:40:00,000
No, it's still out to you, Pinkberry.

1653
01:40:02,000 --> 01:40:03,000
No matter who you're in the office.

1654
01:40:04,000 --> 01:40:06,000
Is there another century over there?

1655
01:40:06,000 --> 01:40:09,000
But what if you can have like a personal Pinkberry guy?

1656
01:40:09,000 --> 01:40:10,000
Or just like-

1657
01:40:11,000 --> 01:40:12,000
Server to you anytime you want to-

1658
01:40:13,000 --> 01:40:13,000
Yes.

1659
01:40:14,000 --> 01:40:14,000
Yes.

1660
01:40:14,000 --> 01:40:15,000
I'd sell out blue-

1661
01:40:15,000 --> 01:40:16,000
I'd sell out blue-

1662
01:40:16,000 --> 01:40:16,000
I'd sell out blue-

1663
01:40:18,000 --> 01:40:20,000
Oh my god.

1664
01:40:20,000 --> 01:40:21,000
There's so many people.

1665
01:40:21,000 --> 01:40:22,000
I wish there was a demo right now.

1666
01:40:25,000 --> 01:40:26,000
Oh my god.

1667
01:40:26,000 --> 01:40:27,000
There's so many people.

1668
01:40:27,000 --> 01:40:28,000
I wish there was a demo right now.

1669
01:40:33,000 --> 01:40:33,000
I can like-

1670
01:40:33,000 --> 01:40:34,000
I'm hallucinating.

1671
01:40:34,000 --> 01:40:35,000
Dipping dots right now.

1672
01:40:35,000 --> 01:40:35,000
I can't-

1673
01:40:35,000 --> 01:40:36,000
I'm sorry.

1674
01:40:36,000 --> 01:40:36,000
I'm gonna-

1675
01:40:36,000 --> 01:40:37,000
Let's take this in here.

1676
01:40:38,000 --> 01:40:39,000
Just think about sesame chicken instead.

1677
01:40:40,000 --> 01:40:42,000
Oh, I'm now hallucinating that.

1678
01:40:42,000 --> 01:40:43,000
Very suggestible.

1679
01:40:43,000 --> 01:40:44,000
Because I'm feeling-

1680
01:40:44,000 --> 01:40:44,000
No, I'm not hungry.

1681
01:40:49,000 --> 01:40:50,000
There's a game going on.

1682
01:40:50,000 --> 01:40:51,000
Might even over it soon.

1683
01:40:52,000 --> 01:40:53,000
I guess I am.

1684
01:40:54,000 --> 01:40:57,000
Dipping dots about the ice cream of the future for 20 years.

1685
01:40:59,000 --> 01:41:02,000
This is the team of fucking engineers, holy shit.

1686
01:41:05,000 --> 01:41:07,000
This is like watching Stur's old streams.

1687
01:41:08,000 --> 01:41:09,000
You have-

1688
01:41:09,000 --> 01:41:09,000
Streams teams.

1689
01:41:09,000 --> 01:41:10,000
Two medics.

1690
01:41:11,000 --> 01:41:13,000
Everyone is Kagga and Ying in spawn.

1691
01:41:14,000 --> 01:41:16,000
Everyone's trying to high five you.

1692
01:41:16,000 --> 01:41:17,000
Yep.

1693
01:41:18,000 --> 01:41:18,000
This is-

1694
01:41:18,000 --> 01:41:20,000
This is like when I stop streaming TF2.

1695
01:41:22,000 --> 01:41:24,000
When are you thinking of dipping dots in Boston?

1696
01:41:24,000 --> 01:41:24,000
I'm gonna look.

1697
01:41:26,000 --> 01:41:27,000
Oh, thanks so.

1698
01:41:27,000 --> 01:41:30,000
Oh, he's so low and I didn't get the last couple hits.

1699
01:41:30,000 --> 01:41:30,000
This is still a tell-

1700
01:41:30,000 --> 01:41:32,000
We gotta go to that place one of these days.

1701
01:41:32,000 --> 01:41:34,000
We get the lobster mac and cheese.

1702
01:41:35,000 --> 01:41:35,000
We do.

1703
01:41:37,000 --> 01:41:38,000
Lobster mac and cheese.

1704
01:41:38,000 --> 01:41:40,000
I still don't remember the name of that place.

1705
01:41:40,000 --> 01:41:41,000
Oshiana.

1706
01:41:42,000 --> 01:41:43,000
Who did I kill?

1707
01:41:43,000 --> 01:41:44,000
Who did I kill?

1708
01:41:44,000 --> 01:41:49,000
Corporate headquarters for dipping dots is in Massachusetts.

1709
01:41:52,000 --> 01:41:52,000
Is it really?

1710
01:41:53,000 --> 01:41:53,000
Yes.

1711
01:41:54,000 --> 01:41:56,000
The headquarters of dipping dots.

1712
01:41:56,000 --> 01:41:56,000
We-

1713
01:41:56,000 --> 01:41:56,000
Let's-

1714
01:41:56,000 --> 01:41:57,000
Excuse it.

1715
01:41:57,000 --> 01:41:59,000
I would send them a message and ask for a tour.

1716
01:41:59,000 --> 01:42:00,000
The corporate office.

1717
01:42:01,000 --> 01:42:02,000
You think they do tours?

1718
01:42:03,000 --> 01:42:04,000
If they do, let's do it.

1719
01:42:04,000 --> 01:42:05,000
That would be so fun.

1720
01:42:06,000 --> 01:42:07,000
Ooh, it's right next door.

1721
01:42:07,000 --> 01:42:07,000
That's so cool.

1722
01:42:09,000 --> 01:42:10,000
Weeeeee.

1723
01:42:10,000 --> 01:42:11,000
Weeeeee.

1724
01:42:14,000 --> 01:42:16,000
We'd probably be-

1725
01:42:16,000 --> 01:42:19,000
What if we were the only people there over like 12?

1726
01:42:20,000 --> 01:42:21,000
You know how-

1727
01:42:21,000 --> 01:42:22,000
The dipping dots factory.

1728
01:42:23,000 --> 01:42:23,000
Wait, no.

1729
01:42:23,000 --> 01:42:25,000
I think this is Rhode Island actually.

1730
01:42:26,000 --> 01:42:28,000
It's just south of the messages.

1731
01:42:28,000 --> 01:42:28,000
I was wrong.

1732
01:42:29,000 --> 01:42:30,000
I didn't see the little dots in the map.

1733
01:42:30,000 --> 01:42:31,000
I'll ready to get our like-

1734
01:42:32,000 --> 01:42:33,000
Our hopes up.

1735
01:42:34,000 --> 01:42:34,000
That's-

1736
01:42:34,000 --> 01:42:35,000
That's-

1737
01:42:35,000 --> 01:42:35,000
That's-

1738
01:42:35,000 --> 01:42:36,000
That's not far.

1739
01:42:38,000 --> 01:42:38,000
Rhode Island is tiny.

1740
01:42:39,000 --> 01:42:40,000
I don't know what it's like.

1741
01:42:43,000 --> 01:42:46,000
Actually, yeah, the train does go right to the scene.

1742
01:42:49,000 --> 01:42:50,000
I smell a road trip.

1743
01:42:51,000 --> 01:42:52,000
Road trip.

1744
01:42:53,000 --> 01:42:53,000
Ow.

1745
01:42:53,000 --> 01:42:55,000
Hey, yeah, we're not driving people.

1746
01:42:55,000 --> 01:42:56,000
We wouldn't understand, though.

1747
01:42:57,000 --> 01:42:58,000
Let's rent a bus and just pick up-

1748
01:42:58,000 --> 01:42:59,000
Okay, here.

1749
01:42:59,000 --> 01:43:01,000
Let's rent a bus and pick up the whole chat.

1750
01:43:03,000 --> 01:43:03,000
Yeah.

1751
01:43:03,000 --> 01:43:04,000
That's a really long bus.

1752
01:43:09,000 --> 01:43:10,000
Oh.

1753
01:43:10,000 --> 01:43:11,000
Would you even be able to turn that bus?

1754
01:43:11,000 --> 01:43:13,000
It would be like-

1755
01:43:13,000 --> 01:43:15,000
It would be like playing a real life game with Snake.

1756
01:43:15,000 --> 01:43:17,000
Or anything that way can start a Biker gang.

1757
01:43:17,000 --> 01:43:20,000
You know whenever you see like a whole bunch of Biker's drive-

1758
01:43:20,000 --> 01:43:22,000
It's like, oh, whoa, who are those guys?

1759
01:43:22,000 --> 01:43:22,000
That's cool.

1760
01:43:22,000 --> 01:43:23,000
Guys are so awesome.

1761
01:43:23,000 --> 01:43:24,000
Please make really loud noises.

1762
01:43:24,000 --> 01:43:25,000
This is awesome.

1763
01:43:25,000 --> 01:43:28,000
And then we just all be in the chat going to Dip and Doth.

1764
01:43:30,000 --> 01:43:32,000
There is a different dots in place.

1765
01:43:32,000 --> 01:43:34,000
It is 1.3 miles away.

1766
01:43:34,000 --> 01:43:34,000
Go run heavy.

1767
01:43:34,000 --> 01:43:35,000
Run.

1768
01:43:35,000 --> 01:43:36,000
You have the power of speed.

1769
01:43:37,000 --> 01:43:39,000
Dude.

1770
01:43:40,000 --> 01:43:42,000
I wouldn't recommend people use speed.

1771
01:43:46,000 --> 01:43:48,000
The power of speed.

1772
01:43:50,000 --> 01:43:52,000
That's a drug, Jabba.

1773
01:43:52,000 --> 01:43:56,000
No, like fast-going, moving fast speed.

1774
01:43:56,000 --> 01:43:58,000
Yeah, that's how they get you to take it.

1775
01:43:58,000 --> 01:44:00,000
I want to get in here and get everybody but the crit.

1776
01:44:00,000 --> 01:44:02,000
Oh.

1777
01:44:02,000 --> 01:44:04,000
This don't work like Snake.

1778
01:44:04,000 --> 01:44:06,000
It's dire re-adults.

1779
01:44:10,000 --> 01:44:12,000
Yeah.

1780
01:44:12,000 --> 01:44:14,000
I could actually really go for some fried calamari.

1781
01:44:16,000 --> 01:44:18,000
Yeah, not really a fan of calamari.

1782
01:44:18,000 --> 01:44:20,000
It's a little too salty for me.

1783
01:44:20,000 --> 01:44:22,000
Yeah, well then get it less salty.

1784
01:44:22,000 --> 01:44:24,000
Yeah, I'm not going to get it.

1785
01:44:24,000 --> 01:44:26,000
I'm not going to get it.

1786
01:44:26,000 --> 01:44:28,000
I'm not going to get it.

1787
01:44:28,000 --> 01:44:30,000
I'm not going to get it.

1788
01:44:30,000 --> 01:44:32,000
Yeah, I'm not going to get it.

1789
01:44:32,000 --> 01:44:34,000
Yeah, so I'm not going to get it.

1790
01:44:34,000 --> 01:44:36,000
아니� of salt.

1791
01:44:36,000 --> 01:44:38,000
You know, you've got to build up your salt towers.

1792
01:44:38,000 --> 01:44:42,000
You're just like if you eat raw chunks of salt every day.

1793
01:44:42,000 --> 01:44:44,000
You.

1794
01:44:44,000 --> 01:44:46,000
Talking to your about salt makes me want to be like.

1795
01:44:46,000 --> 01:44:48,000
Really lazy eat like four cups of uh.

1796
01:44:48,000 --> 01:44:50,000
Coppuraman noodle thing.

1797
01:44:50,000 --> 01:44:52,000
That's what salt is makes me think of.

1798
01:44:52,000 --> 01:44:54,000
That's so beauty.

1799
01:44:54,000 --> 01:44:56,000
Those things are salt.

1800
01:44:56,000 --> 01:44:58,000
Average. Oh come on

1801
01:44:59,000 --> 01:45:05,000
You don't say that ramen like the cup noodle stuff. It's such a great when it's really cold out

1802
01:45:05,000 --> 01:45:07,000
You just sit there and you got the broth and you sip in it and ship

1803
01:45:09,000 --> 01:45:11,000
You get to the very bottom

1804
01:45:11,000 --> 01:45:16,000
Stir has seen a mind of a chef which like went back to the origins of ramen

1805
01:45:16,000 --> 01:45:23,000
No, he just talked about why ramen was cool and opened my mind and then I had a really good ramen at that place we go and it's like my

1806
01:45:23,000 --> 01:45:26,000
My mind has been blown

1807
01:45:26,000 --> 01:45:31,000
But I have a problem can be there bit you come and visit we're gonna go to that place and we're gonna well you're a ramen mind

1808
01:45:32,000 --> 01:45:34,000
Actually, I don't know maybe on the day we come back

1809
01:45:36,000 --> 01:45:38,000
I'll go

1810
01:45:38,000 --> 01:45:41,000
You will have at least two of the best things you've ever eaten

1811
01:45:43,000 --> 01:45:45,000
Sounds good

1812
01:45:45,000 --> 01:45:47,000
I like things that I like to eat sounds like a plane

1813
01:45:47,000 --> 01:45:49,000
Wow

1814
01:45:50,000 --> 01:45:54,000
Wow controversial I like things I like to eat I

1815
01:45:55,000 --> 01:45:57,000
Actually have a lot of things that I like to

1816
01:45:57,000 --> 01:46:04,000
Wow, there's many things that I like to eat how old the night only a few things that I don't like the rest I would eat

1817
01:46:05,000 --> 01:46:07,000
Like I don't like shellfish

1818
01:46:08,000 --> 01:46:11,000
Other than that though I like pretty much everything else

1819
01:46:12,000 --> 01:46:14,000
How do you respond

1820
01:46:14,000 --> 01:46:18,000
Like all other food except shellfish

1821
01:46:19,000 --> 01:46:25,000
Pretty much that's the only thing I would like I'm like I don't want that I don't want that as cargo

1822
01:46:29,000 --> 01:46:34,000
Snail right yes, I don't know it'd be tough

1823
01:46:35,000 --> 01:46:40,000
Oh shit, it's this guy again. Is this snail almost like a shellfish. It's like a shell

1824
01:46:41,000 --> 01:46:43,000
Not fish

1825
01:46:44,000 --> 01:46:46,000
It doesn't

1826
01:46:47,000 --> 01:46:49,000
Just don't like the whole idea

1827
01:46:51,000 --> 01:46:53,000
I just don't know I just don't like it

1828
01:46:54,000 --> 01:46:55,000
Lobster macaroni

1829
01:46:55,000 --> 01:46:58,000
Do you like raw bugs is a question?

1830
01:47:00,000 --> 01:47:06,000
Bugs do you like you like bugs also raw they're not cooking these bugs

1831
01:47:09,000 --> 01:47:11,000
You

1832
01:47:11,000 --> 01:47:13,000
I

1833
01:47:13,000 --> 01:47:18,000
Sware there was some study I'm gonna say that when I don't know what the hell I'm talking about

1834
01:47:18,000 --> 01:47:22,000
I'm just gonna say they were paying so little attention you went the whole way

1835
01:47:22,000 --> 01:47:27,000
I'm spawned by the I know I'm aware of this I I figured that up

1836
01:47:27,000 --> 01:47:33,000
Like don't run shoot or I could see I'm doing something my brain is trying to piece together the thing

1837
01:47:33,000 --> 01:47:38,000
I was just gonna say and I don't even what was it what was the last three words I said

1838
01:47:38,000 --> 01:47:44,000
Do you remember there was some research that there was a study there was a study

1839
01:47:46,000 --> 01:47:50,000
We're talking about the same people who's shellfish taught the lady French

1840
01:47:51,000 --> 01:47:55,000
I don't know it's the kids gone. It's just gone. All right

1841
01:47:56,000 --> 01:47:58,000
Some Bob Bob bugs

1842
01:48:01,000 --> 01:48:05,000
Oh shit, that's not a shotgun. Here was a study that's the end of the story

1843
01:48:05,000 --> 01:48:07,000
I know that was a study down at one point

1844
01:48:09,000 --> 01:48:12,000
I think it involved shellfish it'll it'll come to me

1845
01:48:15,000 --> 01:48:18,000
Think your team is winning I hope so

1846
01:48:20,000 --> 01:48:22,000
Winning

1847
01:48:24,000 --> 01:48:26,000
That's like what I like the least favorite

1848
01:48:26,000 --> 01:48:28,000
I

1849
01:48:29,000 --> 01:48:31,000
Just said

1850
01:48:34,000 --> 01:48:36,000
I'm charging here

1851
01:48:37,000 --> 01:48:40,000
I watched that interview live you know don't know why

1852
01:48:43,000 --> 01:48:48,000
And then the main came out and I was like I was there man was there when he was winning

1853
01:48:49,000 --> 01:48:51,000
God

1854
01:48:51,000 --> 01:48:53,000
This fucking guy

1855
01:48:54,000 --> 01:48:56,000
Can I have like a brain shield?

1856
01:48:58,000 --> 01:49:04,000
Can I put a thing on my can I put like a fucking astronaut helmet on me to steal is this like the medic amulet?

1857
01:49:04,000 --> 01:49:07,000
Yeah, I could really use the medic amulet right now

1858
01:49:10,000 --> 01:49:12,000
That would be fantastic if I had that equipped

1859
01:49:12,000 --> 01:49:14,000
I

1860
01:49:20,000 --> 01:49:24,000
Studies are usually inherently flawed I want some of that ramen dude

1861
01:49:26,000 --> 01:49:29,000
Not usually aha boo I spoke to you

1862
01:49:32,000 --> 01:49:36,000
Oh, it's blowing the call trying to scare that guy

1863
01:49:38,000 --> 01:49:40,000
Poor boo is no idea

1864
01:49:42,000 --> 01:49:44,000
But I know where is boo?

1865
01:49:45,000 --> 01:49:47,000
Yeah, what's he doing? What do you think?

1866
01:49:48,000 --> 01:49:54,000
Sleeping probably playing rocket league. He's gotten very good at it and he plays it a lot. I talked to him earlier

1867
01:49:55,000 --> 01:49:58,000
He said he said he was going to bed

1868
01:50:01,000 --> 01:50:04,000
But how reliable is it that I just teleported or reliable in germ?

1869
01:50:06,000 --> 01:50:08,000
Not a high standard

1870
01:50:09,000 --> 01:50:11,000
I

1871
01:50:11,000 --> 01:50:13,000
Easy

1872
01:50:16,000 --> 01:50:19,000
I have to go to the potty you view better not

1873
01:50:24,000 --> 01:50:27,000
I went to it three times during the stream that means it's mine

1874
01:50:28,000 --> 01:50:30,000
All right, I don't want to cause any trouble down there

1875
01:50:31,000 --> 01:50:34,000
Let's see about that when I talk to that's where is he?

1876
01:50:35,000 --> 01:50:41,000
Do one day I'm gonna like wake up from a dead sleep I'm still not hey, she that's what he did. I should have done the same thing

1877
01:50:42,000 --> 01:50:48,000
When you see a spy in a tight corridor like that you just start swinging in every single direction and one of you will win

1878
01:50:48,000 --> 01:50:51,000
I didn't do that. I pulled out the revolver, which was this mistake

1879
01:50:52,000 --> 01:50:56,000
That was a smart idea you just handled it very poorly like it

1880
01:50:56,000 --> 01:51:01,000
No, we both bumped into each other. He just went and he did the chaos to have I should have done that I didn't do it and I died

1881
01:51:02,000 --> 01:51:04,000
The chaos Deb

1882
01:51:07,000 --> 01:51:09,000
That's right I broke my own rule

1883
01:51:16,000 --> 01:51:18,000
Shit

1884
01:51:23,000 --> 01:51:27,000
He's looking for me I wasn't a headshot apparently I

1885
01:51:28,000 --> 01:51:32,000
Think based on that scenario I know that I could beat you in a night like oh come on

1886
01:51:35,000 --> 01:51:37,000
I

1887
01:51:37,000 --> 01:51:41,000
Want to how many times this guy's killed me probably like 12

1888
01:51:46,000 --> 01:51:48,000
Nice no escaping

1889
01:51:48,000 --> 01:51:50,000
I

1890
01:51:54,000 --> 01:52:00,000
To be fair he didn't swing in every single direction. He swung in a very specific direction specifically at you

1891
01:52:00,000 --> 01:52:03,000
Yeah, that's true. I did not I did not do that

1892
01:52:05,000 --> 01:52:07,000
Dude let's play the drawing game

1893
01:52:08,000 --> 01:52:10,000
I've been running for months

1894
01:52:11,000 --> 01:52:12,000
I'm not

1895
01:52:13,000 --> 01:52:19,000
Is it a game the drawing game remember the vomit you I do remember drawing

1896
01:52:20,000 --> 01:52:22,000
The vomit shield

1897
01:52:25,000 --> 01:52:28,000
Ha you were paying attention back good

1898
01:52:32,000 --> 01:52:36,000
Not anymore now I'm trying to take out a century with his engineer over here a

1899
01:52:37,000 --> 01:52:42,000

Yeah, keep me over it. Keep me over it so I can like actually get out of spawn and hurt someone

1969
01:59:05,000 --> 01:59:07,000

1970
01:59:08,000 --> 01:59:11,000

You see some rob bitch that the name of it. I think it is truffle

1974
01:59:29,000 --> 01:59:32,000
Stir we need another guy

1975
01:59:34,000 --> 01:59:42,000
You know, not I am tired and we're gonna we need to get boys for it one day. All right. We'll get some boys

1976
01:59:42,000 --> 01:59:47,000
We'll get some some gentlemen look at some I don't love gentlemen. I want boys

1977
01:59:51,000 --> 01:59:53,000
Suggestible boys

1978
01:59:53,000 --> 01:59:55,000
So that was it what I'm gonna do

1979
01:59:56,000 --> 01:59:58,000
See what am I gonna do right now?

1980
01:59:59,000 --> 02:00:01,000
Banny

1981
02:00:02,000 --> 02:00:06,000
No banny someone said I think he was suggesting a boy

1982
02:00:07,000 --> 02:00:11,000
Sure, banny would play on box an invasion crate. I don't have an invasion crate

1983
02:00:12,000 --> 02:00:16,000
I probably would nothing dropped

1984
02:00:19,000 --> 02:00:25,000
All right, I'm going to use the restroom I'm gonna rest a little bit in the restroom

1985
02:00:27,000 --> 02:00:31,000
And then I'm gonna figure out I might stop streaming I might move to something else

1986
02:00:32,000 --> 02:00:37,000
Oh, I'd recommend something I think I might go you're leaving

1987
02:00:38,000 --> 02:00:43,000
Possibly this dog is looking at speed. I think that means it's time for bed. Oh she's sleepy

1988
02:00:44,000 --> 02:00:46,000
That's gonna be

1989
02:00:46,000 --> 02:00:48,000
This is yeah, this is live streamer bathroom time

1990
02:00:51,000 --> 02:00:55,000
You know how we need to have one of the streamer's like cameras everywhere for any roomie you go

1991
02:00:55,000 --> 02:00:57,000
And it has some all live at any time

1992
02:00:58,000 --> 02:01:02,000
So I'm gonna have like a nine camera shoot inside my bathroom. Yeah, swing galaxy style

1993
02:01:02,000 --> 02:01:06,000
There's just gonna be one in every corner on everywhere. Yeah

1994
02:01:08,000 --> 02:01:12,000
That way you can you can cut it into a montage when you're done with multiple angles

1995
02:01:16,000 --> 02:01:21,000
Make a frag movie out of it that would be pretty pretty stupid

1996
02:01:22,000 --> 02:01:30,000
All right guys back you you two are leaving. I'm assuming I guess all right we're losing these two chumps

1997
02:01:31,000 --> 02:01:35,000
Good night. Oh, buddy. Thanks. Thanks for hanging out in the stream guys. It was fun

1998
02:01:35,000 --> 02:01:37,000

1999
02:01:37,000 --> 02:01:41,000

02:01:43,000 --> 02:01:45,000
Unbelievable

2001
02:01:48,000 --> 02:01:50,000
Tell her germa he needs to eat the cheese

2002
02:01:51,000 --> 02:01:53,000
What cheese?

2003
02:01:53,000 --> 02:02:00,000
I actually would play Mario maker right now if this room was set up to be able to play it. I don't have my Wii U in this room

2004
02:02:01,000 --> 02:02:07,000
But hang tight I will be back in a couple minutes. I'm gonna grab a drink. I'm gonna take the take the bathroom

2005
02:02:07,000 --> 02:02:12,000
I'm gonna take the bathroom out of my bathroom and use it in my living room. I'll be right back

2006
02:02:13,000 --> 02:02:15,000
Hold on a second

2007
02:02:30,000 --> 02:02:32,000
You

2008
02:03:00,000 --> 02:03:02,000
You

2009
02:03:30,000 --> 02:03:32,000
You

2010
02:04:00,000 --> 02:04:02,000
You

2011
02:04:30,000 --> 02:04:33,000
You

2012
02:05:00,000 --> 02:05:02,000
You

2013
02:05:10,000 --> 02:05:13,000
Okay, I guess I'm lemonade I

2014
02:05:16,000 --> 02:05:20,000
Know what I do right now just to kind of chill for a little bit

2015
02:05:23,000 --> 02:05:27,000
I don't see what do I got what do I got on the steam library

2016
02:05:30,000 --> 02:05:32,000
I

2017
02:05:35,000 --> 02:05:46,000
Could play I could play more cryptarch but that requires a ton of my focus and I'd rather just chill for the remaining like however long I'm gonna stream for

2018
02:06:00,000 --> 02:06:08,000
So many games in liat nothing to play

2019
02:06:14,000 --> 02:06:16,000
Mine sweeper

2020
02:06:22,000 --> 02:06:26,000
Star and actually went to bed I think

2021
02:06:31,000 --> 02:06:33,000
Maybe I'll do this

2022
02:06:40,000 --> 02:06:48,000
Yeah, that's a game that's really easy just to turn your brain off and I'll you know we'll do how about this

2023
02:06:49,000 --> 02:06:53,000
For the last like I'm gonna be 30 minutes. I'm gonna play Diablo 3

2024
02:06:54,000 --> 02:06:57,000
Just kind of run around and swirling people maybe

2025
02:06:57,000 --> 02:07:02,000
And maybe I'll play like a hardstone and be terrible

2026
02:07:03,000 --> 02:07:06,000
All right, hold on a second. I want to get this like to see

2027
02:07:07,000 --> 02:07:09,000
What would you guys would rather see here?

2028
02:07:13,000 --> 02:07:16,000
Whoops, there is no game I

2029
02:07:19,000 --> 02:07:21,000
Don't have a game to show you

2030
02:07:21,000 --> 02:07:23,000
I

2031
02:07:26,000 --> 02:07:32,000
Can either play hardstone and be terrible binding of Isaac or Diablo which one

2032
02:07:38,000 --> 02:07:40,000
And I'm gonna warn you guys

2033
02:07:41,000 --> 02:07:45,000
Watching me play hardstone is going to drive a ton of you crazy

2034
02:07:45,000 --> 02:07:51,000
Let's do a let's do a poll

2035
02:07:52,000 --> 02:07:55,000
I'm gonna do one of those fancy polls that you see from time to time

2036
02:08:10,000 --> 02:08:12,000
Stop changing

2037
02:08:12,000 --> 02:08:16,000
Yeah, it's gonna be very simple straw poll

2038
02:08:31,000 --> 02:08:34,000
Okay, I'm gonna put it in the chat why not

2039
02:08:42,000 --> 02:08:49,000
And we have you have 30 seconds to vote by the way you have 30 seconds to vote on this poll

2040
02:08:59,000 --> 02:09:03,000
Well binding of Isaac seems to be destroying everything else right now

2041
02:09:04,000 --> 02:09:11,000
We're gonna we're closing this out in like less than 30 seconds

2042
02:09:20,000 --> 02:09:23,000
Play wonder book that is actually not a terrible idea

2043
02:09:24,000 --> 02:09:26,000
Not tonight. I definitely can't do it tonight

2044
02:09:27,000 --> 02:09:29,000
But

2045
02:09:31,000 --> 02:09:38,000
Damn that would be really cool because those games are really funny and really crazy, but they're actually pretty interesting

2046
02:09:43,000 --> 02:09:48,000
All right, it's very clear binding of Isaac is winning by way too much for anything else to win

2047
02:09:52,000 --> 02:09:56,000
So yeah, where the poll is now closed. I'm gonna play binding of it. It's gonna be

2048
02:09:56,000 --> 02:10:02,000
binding of Isaac and I'm just gonna answer questions. It may questions and answers binding of Isaac time

2049
02:10:06,000 --> 02:10:08,000
So let's load that up

2050
02:10:23,000 --> 02:10:25,000
Go play a real game

2051
02:10:27,000 --> 02:10:34,000
Yeah, but I think one by like it was like 60% or something or 50 something percent

2052
02:10:36,000 --> 02:10:39,000
I need to change my stream title to make sense

2053
02:10:45,000 --> 02:10:47,000
I'm not playing to you anymore

2054
02:10:50,000 --> 02:10:55,000
To make sense. Oh, no, I can hear my speech. Yeah, he presents messin with Sasquatch

2055
02:10:56,000 --> 02:10:58,000
This is like an ad play now

2056
02:10:58,000 --> 02:11:03,000
Dude hey guys. Oh, nice big and a Sasquatch messing with Sasquatch

2057

I'm getting a messing with Sasquatch ad

2058
02:11:13,000 --> 02:11:15,000
Why do I think that's so funny?

2059
02:11:15,000 --> 02:11:18,000
We were talking about Sasquatch this whole time

2060
02:11:20,000 --> 02:11:22,000

2061
02:11:26,000 --> 02:11:29,000

2062
02:11:31,000 --> 02:11:35,000
I met Rob bottom I hit it I hit Rob bottom

2063
02:11:43,000 --> 02:11:45,000
Perfect

2064
02:11:46,000 --> 02:11:48,000
Okay

2065
02:11:51,000 --> 02:11:53,000
Okay

2066
02:11:54,000 --> 02:11:56,000
Close that

2067
02:11:56,000 --> 02:11:58,000
And I need to change this

2068
02:11:59,000 --> 02:12:01,000
That's not right

2069
02:12:07,000 --> 02:12:11,000
Binding of Isaac rebirth there it is

2070
02:12:16,000 --> 02:12:23,000
So for the remainder, I this is I'm just gonna be chilling and I'm gonna answer questions

2071
02:12:23,000 --> 02:12:26,000
How does that sound we're gonna do some questions and answers and answers

2072
02:12:30,000 --> 02:12:33,000
Currently on a minus two not doing hard. This is just hanging out

2073
02:12:35,000 --> 02:12:38,000
Take a sip of my lemonade because it's delicious

2074
02:12:42,000 --> 02:12:44,000
Are we gonna get a germa rumble this holiday

2075
02:12:46,000 --> 02:12:48,000
I really sincerely hope so

2076
02:12:49,000 --> 02:12:54,000
But I can't guarantee it. I'm going to do everything in my power to do this particular video

2077
02:12:56,000 --> 02:12:59,000
Hopefully it happens it's gonna be hard. I'm good king

2078
02:13:04,000 --> 02:13:12,000
Would have inspired me to create grandpa well grandpa I think I've actually answered this before

2079
02:13:12,000 --> 02:13:21,000
It's based on my grandmother that voice and that like whole character is pretty much just my biological grandmother

2080
02:13:23,000 --> 02:13:29,000
She used to talk just like that I would imitate her she lived with us in the house when I was growing up

2081
02:13:30,000 --> 02:13:32,000
And that's kind of how it worked

2082
02:13:36,000 --> 02:13:39,000
I'm ever gonna get real platinum god absolutely no

2083
02:13:39,000 --> 02:13:42,000
Well, it depends if the new

2084
02:13:44,000 --> 02:13:46,000
Isaac expansion is really really awesome really fun

2085
02:13:47,000 --> 02:13:49,000
Maybe I'll play this shit out of that I don't know

2086
02:13:53,000 --> 02:13:59,000
I can't guarantee anything dude guys. Here's another thing. I don't even know what I'm gonna have for breakfast tomorrow

2087
02:14:00,000 --> 02:14:04,000
And like videos and and and all this stuff. I don't I have no idea

2088
02:14:04,000 --> 02:14:08,000
I'm gonna try to make whatever I can make and do whatever I can do

2089
02:14:09,000 --> 02:14:13,000
But I seriously don't even know what I'm gonna do tomorrow. It's always a mystery

2090
02:14:17,000 --> 02:14:19,000
I'm using a controller right now. Yes

2091
02:14:21,000 --> 02:14:26,000
I find it easier for me to use a controller. Oh shit, I'm stuck in here

2092
02:14:30,000 --> 02:14:32,000
Before I die from the sky

2093
02:14:38,000 --> 02:14:41,000
Did you go to college? Yes, I did I did go to college

2094
02:14:43,000 --> 02:14:45,000
I have I have a bachelor's degree

2095
02:14:48,000 --> 02:14:50,000
And what do you know I'm also a young bachelor

2096
02:14:53,000 --> 02:14:55,000
Hey, buddy

2097
02:14:57,000 --> 02:14:59,000
Trama, why are you bad at this game?

2098
02:15:01,000 --> 02:15:03,000
Well, I can uh

2099
02:15:04,000 --> 02:15:07,000
I'm not particularly great at any particular game

2100
02:15:09,000 --> 02:15:13,000
Maybe maybe I was in my uh my wonder years kind of

2101
02:15:17,000 --> 02:15:20,000
What was my reaction with star beat cryptalk in a few hours?

2102
02:15:21,000 --> 02:15:23,000
That's just what he does

2103
02:15:23,000 --> 02:15:25,000
That's just what he does

2104
02:15:25,000 --> 02:15:31,000
Stodges beats every game and it plays it to it's utmost like he plays the shit out of it and beats everything

2105
02:15:31,000 --> 02:15:34,000
Before I even like have a chance to even download the game

2106
02:15:35,000 --> 02:15:38,000
That's just what he does

2107
02:15:41,000 --> 02:15:43,000
I'm pretty good mobile game player

2108
02:15:44,000 --> 02:15:46,000
I'm way with the secret room B

2109
02:15:51,000 --> 02:15:53,000
I'm gonna guess right here

2110
02:15:55,000 --> 02:15:57,000
And please be right

2111
02:15:58,000 --> 02:16:00,000
Shit

2112
02:16:00,000 --> 02:16:02,000
I

2113
02:16:02,000 --> 02:16:06,000
Are you still doing volunteer work or did that magical idea for rarigate? No, I actually oh

2114
02:16:06,000 --> 02:16:09,000
I'll talk about that for a minute or two. I'm just gonna go. I'm not going in there

2115
02:16:11,000 --> 02:16:16,000
Uh, I did that where I was at a volunteer at an animal shelter for eight months

2116
02:16:16,000 --> 02:16:19,000
I stopped a while back before I moved

2117
02:16:21,000 --> 02:16:25,000
It was really interesting experience I will gotta say

2118
02:16:26,000 --> 02:16:27,000
I

2119
02:16:27,000 --> 02:16:29,000
Walked to dogs

2120
02:16:29,000 --> 02:16:31,000
That was a dog walker

2121
02:16:32,000 --> 02:16:35,000
Sometimes there were a lot of dogs in the kennel sometimes there were like none

2122
02:16:37,000 --> 02:16:40,000
So some days you'd be kind of boring you'd go in and they'd be like really nothing to do

2123
02:16:41,000 --> 02:16:43,000
They'd be like maybe one real dog there, but then

2124
02:16:44,000 --> 02:16:47,000
There was a very large amount of dogs that came in

2125
02:16:48,000 --> 02:16:50,000
And for a while

2126
02:16:50,000 --> 02:16:53,000
They was a lot to do in fact after actually the last like

2127
02:16:53,000 --> 02:16:58,000
I'd say like a full like good seven months or something like when I first got there the it was

2128
02:16:59,000 --> 02:17:01,000
I don't know hard to explain

2129
02:17:02,000 --> 02:17:04,000
But there was a

2130
02:17:04,000 --> 02:17:07,000
It was definitely cool experience if you like dogs I would do it

2131
02:17:08,000 --> 02:17:13,000
If you like animals why not you don't have to do it forever. Let's do it for as long as you can

2132
02:17:14,000 --> 02:17:16,000
Or just you don't dump

2133
02:17:17,000 --> 02:17:21,000
kittens are puppies well. I just said I was a dog walker so fucking dogs puppies

2134
02:17:23,000 --> 02:17:25,000
Oh

2135
02:17:26,000 --> 02:17:28,000
Dog walker would have lame dude

2136
02:17:32,000 --> 02:17:34,000
He's volunteer work man

2137
02:17:37,000 --> 02:17:39,000
It wasn't lame

2138
02:17:43,000 --> 02:17:47,000
I was still doing YouTube and stuff at the time and I've been doing YouTube for like five years

2139
02:17:48,000 --> 02:17:50,000
I

2140
02:17:50,000 --> 02:17:56,000
So did wedding videos and stuff like I've been doing things. I don't do that anymore, but I did

2141
02:17:59,000 --> 02:18:01,000
No, I'm never gonna do that with a cigar

2142
02:18:05,000 --> 02:18:07,000
Will you get out of there?

2143
02:18:08,000 --> 02:18:12,000
Get out of there dude. Oh my goodness, please come out of there

2144
02:18:18,000 --> 02:18:20,000
Oh

2145
02:18:20,000 --> 02:18:22,000
I want to explore

2146
02:18:25,000 --> 02:18:28,000
Remember when you were making a game I think you talked about it just no I wanted to write a book

2147
02:18:29,000 --> 02:18:31,000
Then I did start it, but

2148
02:18:32,000 --> 02:18:36,000
Came to the extremely quick conclusion that writing books is extremely difficult

2149
02:18:38,000 --> 02:18:40,000
So I wrote a bunch of stuff and then

2150
02:18:42,000 --> 02:18:46,000
Life got in the way and I became too busy to even have enough like three time to care about that

2151
02:18:47,000 --> 02:18:49,000
Unfortunately

2152
02:18:50,000 --> 02:18:53,000
I can't ever keep talking about undertale. What is undertale?

2153
02:18:58,000 --> 02:19:00,000
This is a new game again on

2154
02:19:03,000 --> 02:19:06,000
How come you lagged on insane aquarium?

2155
02:19:08,000 --> 02:19:11,000
You mean like the third video I ever uploaded to YouTube?

2156
02:19:13,000 --> 02:19:14,000
I don't know

2157
02:19:14,000 --> 02:19:21,000
Probably because I was on like a shitty like dog shit laptop that had like less than like two gigahertz of CPU speed

2158
02:19:30,000 --> 02:19:32,000
Really it's not there

2159
02:19:32,000 --> 02:19:34,000
Did I just miss that or something?

2160
02:19:37,000 --> 02:19:39,000
Hmm, I don't have enough money

2161
02:19:39,000 --> 02:19:41,000
Oh

2162
02:19:43,000 --> 02:19:45,000
Whoa whoa whoa whoa

2163
02:19:46,000 --> 02:19:48,000
That's what I get for not paying attention

2164
02:19:54,000 --> 02:19:56,000
Too bad

2165
02:19:58,000 --> 02:20:03,000
Undertale is a game is that it's mixed reviews and it's one of those games that is good because people say so but I'm not saying it's bad

2166
02:20:05,000 --> 02:20:08,000
Well every game is subjectively bad to somebody, you know

2167
02:20:09,000 --> 02:20:12,000
I don't want to go in there. Let's just get the boss

2168
02:20:19,000 --> 02:20:22,000
Do I watch anime I used to not really anymore

2169
02:20:23,000 --> 02:20:28,000
Back when I was in college I was really like into it. I thought it was really cool and I can't like what the fuck am I doing

2170
02:20:33,000 --> 02:20:35,000
One coin

2171
02:20:35,000 --> 02:20:37,000
I

2172
02:20:40,000 --> 02:20:46,000
Don't I'm confused of what actually just happened. I thought if that was a troll bomb and the troll bomb spawned after that

2173
02:20:47,000 --> 02:20:49,000
apparently

2174
02:20:53,000 --> 02:20:59,000
No, I really I started to watch the anime back when I was in college because

2175
02:20:59,000 --> 02:21:02,000
my TV was pretty much permanently on adult swim and

2176
02:21:03,000 --> 02:21:04,000
And

2177
02:21:04,000 --> 02:21:09,000
Saturdays I believe is when they did their like big anime block and about some of those shows are pretty good

2178
02:21:09,000 --> 02:21:11,000
I

2179
02:21:28,000 --> 02:21:30,000
Want to read this one. Let's see if I can answer it

2180
02:21:32,000 --> 02:21:34,000
After I've monstrosized

2181
02:21:34,000 --> 02:21:42,000
What were the years that you two been life and all that other shit in the mix what's the biggest thing that's changed for you or just what have you noticed that change to you?

2182
02:21:44,000 --> 02:21:46,000
Um

2183
02:21:47,000 --> 02:21:53,000
That's a that's a good question because I really feel like over the last at least couple of years

2184
02:21:53,000 --> 02:22:00,000
I've started to grow up and started to see really see a lot I've been asking myself the questions of fuck

2185
02:22:01,000 --> 02:22:08,000
I'm being like the old person, you know, I'm like oh a back down. It wasn't like that. It was so much we back when we were kids

2186
02:22:08,000 --> 02:22:10,000
I've been doing that a lot lately

2187
02:22:11,000 --> 02:22:19,000
And I'd never ever used to do that but like I am seeing things now like in video games or in TV and movies and I'm just like what fuck is this?

2188
02:22:20,000 --> 02:22:23,000
You know, I was like 19 so much cooler

2189
02:22:25,000 --> 02:22:26,000
but

2190
02:22:26,000 --> 02:22:28,000
You come to realize

2191
02:22:28,000 --> 02:22:32,000
Literally that's every single person when they get older has that conversation with themselves

2192
02:22:33,000 --> 02:22:36,000
And also getting older too like turning 30 was kind of

2193
02:22:38,000 --> 02:22:40,000
It's got scary you know what I mean

2194
02:22:43,000 --> 02:22:47,000
Who's a scary thing when you get over that age you just kind of like okay

2195
02:22:48,000 --> 02:22:51,000
I am 30 years old what the fuck is going on in my life

2196
02:22:53,000 --> 02:22:57,000
You start to reevaluate things that you're doing you start to re-evaluate like where you are

2197
02:22:57,000 --> 02:22:59,000
And where you want to be

2198
02:23:01,000 --> 02:23:03,000
I wouldn't say it's depressing. It's kind of like

2199
02:23:06,000 --> 02:23:09,000
Almost like eye-opening that you see you you start to see things you like differently

2200
02:23:11,000 --> 02:23:15,000
I have like a bunch of kids in my family now like my brother and sister both have kids

2201
02:23:17,000 --> 02:23:22,000
And it's just really weird you start to see that your parents start to get way older and it's

2202
02:23:23,000 --> 02:23:26,000
I'm saying wow life just kind of keeps going doesn't it

2203
02:23:27,000 --> 02:23:29,000
You

2204
02:23:31,000 --> 02:23:33,000
Let it go

2205
02:23:34,000 --> 02:23:38,000
Yeah, you when you turn 30 you have that kind of you have to let it go a conversation. I've let it go

2206
02:23:50,000 --> 02:23:52,000
Turned her looks eight

2207
02:23:53,000 --> 02:23:55,000
That is I guess one thing that I have gone for myself

2208
02:23:55,000 --> 02:24:00,000
I don't I don't like look like I'm 30 plus

2209
02:24:05,000 --> 02:24:10,000
When I look in the mirror I don't see like a 35 year old even I'm not 35 but you know you get the idea

2210
02:24:13,000 --> 02:24:17,000
Technology oh no no no this is this thing shit. I didn't want this

2211
02:24:19,000 --> 02:24:22,000
I actually don't like this at all. I thought I was one of the technologies

2212
02:24:26,000 --> 02:24:27,000
I

2213
02:24:27,000 --> 02:24:29,000
Favorite band is a gorilla's

2214
02:24:29,000 --> 02:24:31,000
for sure

2215
02:24:34,000 --> 02:24:37,000
Since doing this whole move and everything know I've not been working out at all

2216
02:24:38,000 --> 02:24:43,000
Even a little bit before I moved like the last like four months or five months. I probably haven't been to the gym

2217
02:24:46,000 --> 02:24:49,000
Which that's I can get back there I gotta do that again

2218
02:24:49,000 --> 02:24:55,000
Open your face

2219
02:24:57,000 --> 02:24:59,000
Open your face

2220
02:25:01,000 --> 02:25:09,000
Am I fat now? I don't think so. I just made a video where you can see my whole body. I don't think I'm fat

2221
02:25:20,000 --> 02:25:22,000
All right, where am I going here

2222
02:25:30,000 --> 02:25:32,000
Oh, and I'm cane what

2223
02:25:35,000 --> 02:25:39,000
What the fuck oh my goodness gracious

2224
02:25:42,000 --> 02:25:44,000
None of those were any good

2225
02:25:49,000 --> 02:25:51,000
Alrighty

2226
02:25:54,000 --> 02:25:57,000
But I want to join a racing league for Isaac. I don't think I'm good enough at the game

2227
02:25:58,000 --> 02:26:00,000
To be frank

2228
02:26:00,000 --> 02:26:03,000
I would lose every time you probably fun to do it

2229
02:26:05,000 --> 02:26:07,000
Yeah

2230
02:26:07,000 --> 02:26:14,000
But now I'm not I love watching people speedrun in race. It's actually one of my favorite things to watch on twitch

2231
02:26:16,000 --> 02:26:19,000
A lot of the speedrunners that do their streams

2232
02:26:20,000 --> 02:26:26,000
I've been really into Mario maker been really into watching Mario maker streams of people that are like go to the game and like know what they're doing

2233
02:26:28,000 --> 02:26:30,000
Really like that a lot

2234
02:26:43,000 --> 02:26:45,000
Shit

2235
02:26:50,000 --> 02:26:52,000
You know what I'm doing

2236
02:26:56,000 --> 02:26:58,000
Oh, what's my favorite noise or sound

2237
02:27:02,000 --> 02:27:04,000
Uh, okay

2238
02:27:05,000 --> 02:27:07,000
probably

2239
02:27:07,000 --> 02:27:09,000
Rain hitting a roof

2240
02:27:10,000 --> 02:27:14,000
That extremely distinctive rain hitting your roof sound

2241
02:27:16,000 --> 02:27:18,000
Yeah, you know what I'm like that like

2242
02:27:19,000 --> 02:27:21,000
That

2243
02:27:24,000 --> 02:27:30,000
If I could make it rain like that just that gentle heavy kind of big water droplet rain every night. I probably do it

2244
02:27:31,000 --> 02:27:33,000
Give my dog those superpowers

2245
02:27:34,000 --> 02:27:36,000
You

2246
02:27:48,000 --> 02:27:50,000
Shot speed up helps a little bit, doesn't it

2247
02:27:53,000 --> 02:27:57,000
The brain hitting your roof people's brains smash into my roof

2248
02:27:57,000 --> 02:28:05,000
If you could go back in time what point would you go to I wouldn't I

2249
02:28:07,000 --> 02:28:09,000
Would not I would not go back

2250
02:28:11,000 --> 02:28:13,000
And I can explain why I wouldn't go back

2251
02:28:16,000 --> 02:28:20,000
Go look if you ask me if I'd rather go backwards in time or forwards in time

2252
02:28:22,000 --> 02:28:24,000
I would probably say forwards in time

2253
02:28:24,000 --> 02:28:28,000
Like if you have it was like oh you could go forward 10 years or backwards 10 years

2254
02:28:29,000 --> 02:28:31,000
I don't know man to like when growing up

2255
02:28:33,000 --> 02:28:34,000
you

2256
02:28:34,000 --> 02:28:38,000
Like all the things that you can't do when you're the younger like oh, yeah

2257
02:28:38,000 --> 02:28:41,000
I go back to when you're like 15 again or like 12 again or something

2258
02:28:42,000 --> 02:28:44,000
This so much shit you can't do

2259
02:28:45,000 --> 02:28:47,000
That you have to like wait again to be able to do

2260
02:28:48,000 --> 02:28:51,000
Nobody trusts you with anything you're like younger, you know what I mean like it's it's hard

2261
02:28:52,000 --> 02:28:57,000
Like the teenage years can be I mean they're a great time

2262
02:28:57,000 --> 02:29:02,000
I bet you a lot of you guys are probably like in your teens. I would assume for half you guys

2263
02:29:02,000 --> 02:29:08,000
Are like in like that, you know, 15 16 plus maybe college days. I don't know how old all all you guys are

2264
02:29:10,000 --> 02:29:12,000
But with special when you're I wouldn't want to go back and like do it all again

2265
02:29:13,000 --> 02:29:17,000
Oh, but you could go back and you could change everything and do it so differently

2266
02:29:17,000 --> 02:29:21,000
But I've ended up where I am right now and I'm the person I am right now because of the way that I already get it

2267
02:29:22,000 --> 02:29:24,000
You know what I mean

2268
02:29:25,000 --> 02:29:30,000
Like what have I went back and I like changed something would I have ever done half the stuff that I'm doing

2269
02:29:31,000 --> 02:29:33,000
You know, no

2270
02:29:36,000 --> 02:29:38,000
See in 24 or 18 that's what I expected

2271
02:29:40,000 --> 02:29:42,000
Some like the late high school early college

2272
02:29:45,000 --> 02:29:47,000
20 like the median something like 20 I can see that yeah

2273
02:29:48,000 --> 02:29:49,000
So

2274
02:29:50,000 --> 02:29:55,000
28 with a with a with a fail with a face palm dude don't I'm 30 man

2275
02:29:57,000 --> 02:30:01,000
It's not it's not it's not it's not old the world has changed

2276
02:30:03,000 --> 02:30:07,000
30 is the new 25 in my opinion

2277
02:30:10,000 --> 02:30:12,000
This room sucks

2278
02:30:13,000 --> 02:30:15,000
Oh

2279
02:30:15,000 --> 02:30:17,000
Hurry up get over here get them bad

2280
02:30:27,000 --> 02:30:34,000
How the fuck are you 30 hey I wake up and ask myself that question a lot it just happened

2281
02:30:35,000 --> 02:30:39,000
I graduated college and then I turned 30

2282
02:30:39,000 --> 02:30:44,000
What was that was a rock back here which room was the rocket

2283
02:30:49,000 --> 02:30:51,000
There it

2284
02:30:59,000 --> 02:31:03,000
Now I can't do it there wait hold on could it be right here

2285
02:31:05,000 --> 02:31:07,000
Nope

2286
02:31:09,000 --> 02:31:11,000
I

2287
02:31:11,000 --> 02:31:13,000
Time seriously flies don't play MMOs

2288
02:31:14,000 --> 02:31:18,000
I played World of Warcraft for a long time that took a lot of my time

2289
02:31:22,000 --> 02:31:24,000
I played that game for years

2290
02:31:31,000 --> 02:31:35,000
Yes, the more germ of wrestling the more wrestling's on the way

2291
02:31:36,000 --> 02:31:38,000
Don't worry

2292
02:31:38,000 --> 02:31:42,000
I'm I'm trying as hard as I possibly can

2293
02:31:44,000 --> 02:31:46,000
To be able to make this next one

2294
02:31:48,000 --> 02:31:50,000
There it is being worked on

2295
02:31:52,000 --> 02:31:55,000
Fuck where's my tear it's like all in the corner

2296
02:32:02,000 --> 02:32:06,000
Oh for the love of all that is sacred

2297
02:32:06,000 --> 02:32:07,000
Oh

2298
02:32:07,000 --> 02:32:10,000
I'm about to just cramp as the son of a bitch here we go

2299
02:32:18,000 --> 02:32:20,000
Find a fancy 11

2300
02:32:27,000 --> 02:32:31,000
Will you be opening up subs and donations soon uh no

2301
02:32:33,000 --> 02:32:35,000
No

2302
02:32:35,000 --> 02:32:37,000
Subs

2303
02:32:37,000 --> 02:32:39,000
Yes, but donations no

2304
02:32:45,000 --> 02:32:47,000
I'll go I'll go down to eight

2305
02:32:50,000 --> 02:32:53,000
Damn it why have both of these have to have bombs like that

2306
02:32:59,000 --> 02:33:02,000
I mean if at some point I decide to do donations

2307
02:33:03,000 --> 02:33:07,000
I don't I don't know it's it's one of those things that I don't think I'm ever going to do it

2308
02:33:09,000 --> 02:33:11,000
What did that just do to me

2309
02:33:11,000 --> 02:33:13,000
Oh not bad

2310
02:33:20,000 --> 02:33:21,000
Will your TF2 server ever come back

2311
02:33:22,000 --> 02:33:25,000
No, I don't think so I don't think so

2312
02:33:28,000 --> 02:33:32,000
To be completely and totally honest it was kind of just a money sink that I had

2313
02:33:32,000 --> 02:33:34,000
To just sort of get rid of

2314
02:33:38,000 --> 02:33:44,000
And I didn't have like very many good like I have one good admin and he was really reliable and he was always around

2315
02:33:45,000 --> 02:33:48,000
But I I don't know I don't feel like I need to have one

2316
02:33:51,000 --> 02:33:55,000
I had it for a while that was a great I made a ton of videos on that server

2317
02:33:56,000 --> 02:34:00,000
Some of you guys might have even been in those videos where I did like the weird like event type stuff

2318
02:34:01,000 --> 02:34:07,000
Did I forget to get that I did like two floors ago I didn't get that I need to remember that one

2319
02:34:26,000 --> 02:34:28,000
Let's go back this way

2320
02:34:28,000 --> 02:34:33,000
Do I still enjoy TF2 after all these years? I mean I was just playing it

2321
02:34:35,000 --> 02:34:39,000
The core game of team fortress two is does that do anything to this

2322
02:34:41,000 --> 02:34:43,000
It does

2323
02:34:44,000 --> 02:34:48,000
That makes this arguably worse because it stutters

2324
02:34:49,000 --> 02:34:54,000
The core game of TF2 will always be like one of the best games I've ever played

2325
02:34:55,000 --> 02:34:56,000
But

2326
02:34:56,000 --> 02:34:58,000
But there's always a but

2327
02:34:59,000 --> 02:35:00,000
You

2328
02:35:00,000 --> 02:35:05,000
Has only so much you can say or do about anything

2329
02:35:06,000 --> 02:35:10,000
If you guys are wondering why I like haven't really been making TF2 videos

2330
02:35:11,000 --> 02:35:18,000
So because I don't like the game it's because I want something to say I want to like do something in those videos

2331
02:35:19,000 --> 02:35:22,000
And it's lately it's been like yeah, there's not

2332
02:35:23,000 --> 02:35:25,000
Really a whole lot I can say or do

2333
02:35:25,000 --> 02:35:27,000
Oh

2334
02:35:30,000 --> 02:35:35,000
Hold on I don't die here go over there you slow as ball

2335
02:35:38,000 --> 02:35:42,000
Now that doesn't mean that doesn't mean I don't like the game

2336
02:35:43,000 --> 02:35:45,000
Forget what the Joker does we're just gonna use it

2337
02:35:46,000 --> 02:35:48,000
Wonderful

2338
02:35:51,000 --> 02:35:53,000
I don't even wanted to get the key I'd rather just go in

2339
02:35:56,000 --> 02:35:57,000
Oh

2340
02:35:57,000 --> 02:35:59,000
You can drop the trinket what is it but button is it

2341
02:36:06,000 --> 02:36:08,000
It's not that

2342
02:36:19,000 --> 02:36:21,000
Hold control I don't know what is on gamepad

2343
02:36:21,000 --> 02:36:26,000
I don't think I have it set up for this

2344
02:36:30,000 --> 02:36:33,000
Does anyone know what it is on a gamepad is it even bound anything on a game

2345
02:36:37,000 --> 02:36:40,000
Of course of course I hit the button that I'm going to need right now

2346
02:36:48,000 --> 02:36:49,000
There it is

2347
02:36:49,000 --> 02:36:51,000
It's right trigger

2348
02:36:58,000 --> 02:37:00,000
The brain just leaked

2349
02:37:03,000 --> 02:37:09,000
Are you a fan of Bernie Sanders um I'm just gonna say it I

2350
02:37:09,000 --> 02:37:11,000
I don't like talking politics

2351
02:37:12,000 --> 02:37:15,000
I don't I don't know enough about politics to

2352
02:37:15,000 --> 02:37:18,000
Really want to get into like a discussion about it

2353
02:37:19,000 --> 02:37:23,000
But if you want to know if you'd like to know if you if you need to know where I um

2354
02:37:24,000 --> 02:37:28,000
Where am I low you chaotic neutral are you neutral lawful are you lawful good

2355
02:37:29,000 --> 02:37:31,000
I am right in the middle

2356
02:37:33,000 --> 02:37:35,000
There are I am as in the middle as you probably could be

2357
02:37:40,000 --> 02:37:42,000
But let's go

2358
02:37:43,000 --> 02:37:45,000
Any more hearts I yeah this one

2359
02:37:45,000 --> 02:37:48,000
But I don't like talking to even with my friends

2360
02:37:49,000 --> 02:37:55,000
It's just like everyone has their opinions on things and you just don't want to get into like fights and debates with people about it

2361
02:37:56,000 --> 02:37:58,000
Because that's how it always happens where am I going

2362
02:38:05,000 --> 02:38:09,000
I don't know like like Benjamin Franklin once said the great Benjamin Franklin

2363
02:38:09,000 --> 02:38:11,000
Oh, it's in a secret room. That's why

2364
02:38:12,000 --> 02:38:14,000
The great Benjamin Franklin what's what the f

2365
02:38:16,000 --> 02:38:18,000
Which I'm just gonna go

2366
02:38:29,000 --> 02:38:32,000
Well donate the rest the great Benjamin Franklin one said

2367
02:38:34,000 --> 02:38:36,000
Error all things in moderation

2368
02:38:38,000 --> 02:38:40,000
If you're too extreme with anything

2369
02:38:41,000 --> 02:38:46,000
You're not following Benjamin Franklin the greatest president of the United States

2370
02:38:49,000 --> 02:38:51,000
Even though he wasn't a president

2371
02:38:52,000 --> 02:38:55,000
He still felt like one and he's on the hungry

2372
02:38:55,000 --> 02:38:57,000
Oh

2373
02:38:57,000 --> 02:39:05,000
Andrew d i had rejections on on the 20 oh Abraham Lincoln's on the five but Benjamin Franklin is on 100

2374
02:39:06,000 --> 02:39:08,000
He's on the hundred

2375
02:39:08,000 --> 02:39:11,000
Like did we really have to have this discussion

2376
02:39:14,000 --> 02:39:16,000
Is George Washington on the hundred?

2377
02:39:18,000 --> 02:39:20,000
I rest my case

2378
02:39:24,000 --> 02:39:26,000
It's probably things they can do but do I care

2379
02:39:33,000 --> 02:39:35,000
Give me that heart

2380
02:39:38,000 --> 02:39:40,000
Do I follow any sports?

2381
02:39:40,000 --> 02:39:41,000
Not really

2382
02:39:41,000 --> 02:39:43,000
I used to follow the red socks religiously

2383
02:39:46,000 --> 02:39:48,000
The red socks were

2384
02:39:48,000 --> 02:39:51,000
Like my life especially but what it was so awesome

2385
02:39:52,000 --> 02:39:57,000
That 2004 and 2007 World Series. I got to see both of them like they're not live but

2386
02:39:58,000 --> 02:40:01,000
Watching that team win the World Series in 2004

2387
02:40:03,000 --> 02:40:05,000
Was awesome

2388
02:40:05,000 --> 02:40:09,000
They haven't won it in like 90 years or like 86 years or something crazy

2389
02:40:12,000 --> 02:40:14,000
And I was in my dorm room

2390
02:40:16,000 --> 02:40:19,000
Oh, no wait, where was I? When was that 2004?

2391
02:40:21,000 --> 02:40:24,000
No, I was in my two was I in college in 2004? I was right

2392
02:40:25,000 --> 02:40:27,000
No

2393
02:40:27,000 --> 02:40:30,000
No, I think I just barely was like a freshman in college

2394
02:40:31,000 --> 02:40:36,000
Yeah, yeah, I definitely was in college for that

2395
02:40:37,000 --> 02:40:39,000
I am 30 sometimes you forget things

2396
02:40:41,000 --> 02:40:43,000
Oh god, this is gonna be annoying

2397
02:40:49,000 --> 02:40:51,000
Get away from me

2398
02:40:52,000 --> 02:40:54,000
You

2399
02:40:59,000 --> 02:41:02,000
See do any role models or people you'll look up to

2400
02:41:04,000 --> 02:41:08,000
Well, I mean Benjamin Franklin has got to be like the but not uh-huh

2401
02:41:09,000 --> 02:41:11,000
Well when I was younger

2402
02:41:11,000 --> 02:41:14,000
When I was like in my teens it was Jim Carrey

2403
02:41:15,000 --> 02:41:18,000
I like loved everything about Jim Carrey. I thought he was like the funniest

2404
02:41:19,000 --> 02:41:22,000
Most awesome the amazing dude ever

2405
02:41:29,000 --> 02:41:31,000
But as of right now, I mean I

2406
02:41:32,000 --> 02:41:35,000
I don't know I don't really have like a role model anymore

2407
02:41:41,000 --> 02:41:45,000
Will you stream FTL and the follow-up question is who question

2408
02:41:46,000 --> 02:41:49,000
Will you stream FTL and get a girlfriend

2409
02:41:55,000 --> 02:41:59,000
Uh, no one the first one because I I'm not that great at that game

2410
02:42:04,000 --> 02:42:11,000
And the second one I don't know I don't know. I don't know who knows

2411
02:42:15,000 --> 02:42:17,000
I

2412
02:42:20,000 --> 02:42:23,000
What do I want to be when I grow up? Well, I've already grown up

2413
02:42:25,000 --> 02:42:29,000
I wanted to be a magic wand maker when I was in preschool. That's what I said. I wanted to be

2414
02:42:30,000 --> 02:42:32,000
They asked all the kids what they wanted to be when they grew up

2415
02:42:33,000 --> 02:42:36,000
And you had the typical fire fighter doctor

2416
02:42:37,000 --> 02:42:39,000
Magic wand maker

2417
02:42:40,000 --> 02:42:44,000
I wanted to I didn't want to be a magician. I wanted to make the magic ones

2418
02:42:46,000 --> 02:42:48,000
What the

2419
02:42:49,000 --> 02:42:51,000
Why

2420
02:42:51,000 --> 02:42:56,000
Who cares? I do nobody nobody cares about the magic wand maker

2421
02:42:59,000 --> 02:43:01,000
People want to see the magician

2422
02:43:10,000 --> 02:43:14,000
Magic wand maker I bet to the audience probably all laughed

2423
02:43:14,000 --> 02:43:16,000
Oh my god this game is fucked

2424
02:43:18,000 --> 02:43:27,000
My little teddy wants to be an astronaut my little Jacob want to be a policeman and you're telling me your little shit child

2425
02:43:27,000 --> 02:43:30,000
What to be a magical wand maker. It's imagination. All right

2426
02:43:32,000 --> 02:43:34,000
Imagination is really important. Don't have a lose it

2427
02:43:39,000 --> 02:43:41,000
Doesn't matter how old you get

2428
02:43:42,000 --> 02:43:44,000
Don't have a loser imagination

2429
02:43:56,000 --> 02:43:58,000
What do you see yourself on your 30?

2430
02:43:59,000 --> 02:44:00,000
Well

2431
02:44:00,000 --> 02:44:05,000
Sitting right here right now doing this because that's where I currently am at 30. What does this thing mean?

2432
02:44:05,000 --> 02:44:07,000

02:44:10,000 --> 02:44:12,000
Don't think I've ever seen that before

2434
02:44:13,000 --> 02:44:15,000
What is this

2435
02:44:16,000 --> 02:44:18,000
Well, okay, was it wasted bomb

2436
02:44:27,000 --> 02:44:30,000
No one cares about the guy that makes the plans stuff and lucky charms

2437
02:44:30,000 --> 02:44:32,000
I

2438
02:44:34,000 --> 02:44:40,000
Fuck lucky charms lucky charms is only good to get to the end of the marshmallows and then you don't want to eat it anymore

2439
02:44:43,000 --> 02:44:45,000

2440
02:44:45,000 --> 02:44:47,000

2444
02:45:15,000 --> 02:45:17,000
I thought Santa Claus was real until 12 months ago

2445
02:45:23,000 --> 02:45:26,000
Santa Claus is real that's what you guys don't understand

2446
02:45:32,000 --> 02:45:34,000

Home alone is also extremely good that's the one you can't forget

2463

Muppet Christmas Carol home alone or jingle all the way

I don't I don't even like why did I say jingle all the way

2465
02:47:08,000 --> 02:47:10,000
I don't like that movie

2466
02:47:11,000 --> 02:47:13,000
There was no reason for me to say jingle all the way I just said it

2467
02:47:15,000 --> 02:47:19,000
All right jingle all the way because I don't I can't think of my favorite movies

Took me a whole week to listen to all the music on my computer

2491
02:49:35,000 --> 02:49:37,000

Wish I cared a lot about music

2494

Because it's so music is something you can just kind of turn on and like care about it and listen to it

2495
02:49:49,000 --> 02:49:52,000
No, that was a great song that's a great song out of my

2496
02:49:52,000 --> 02:49:54,000
5,000 song collection

2497
02:49:56,000 --> 02:49:58,000
I don't have that

02:50:22,000 --> 02:50:24,000
Hey

2502
02:50:29,000 --> 02:50:34,000
If you were a giant sick how long would you be

2503
02:50:35,000 --> 02:50:37,000
I'm assuming that you're trying to say stick

2504
02:50:41,000 --> 02:50:43,000
I don't know it the yardstick

2505
02:50:44,000 --> 02:50:47,000
Yeah, I'd be like a yardstick. I don't know

2506
02:50:52,000 --> 02:50:54,000
What I study in college communication

2507
02:50:57,000 --> 02:50:59,000
Film TV radio

2508
02:51:11,000 --> 02:51:13,000
I don't know why I was walking towards that guy

2509
02:51:14,000 --> 02:51:16,000
Oh

2510
02:51:20,000 --> 02:51:22,000
You learned how to talk in college

2511
02:51:23,000 --> 02:51:25,000
No, I learned how to

2512
02:51:26,000 --> 02:51:29,000
Well, I'm not being learned is pretty subjective

2513
02:51:30,000 --> 02:51:31,000
I was

2514
02:51:31,000 --> 02:51:38,000
Shown how like radio life is and going to studios and working on demo reels and

2515
02:51:39,000 --> 02:51:43,000
How to use editing programs and more like shops and stuff like that and

2516
02:51:44,000 --> 02:51:51,000
Media marketing and relation public relations. I was it was was that stuff whole thing

2517
02:51:58,000 --> 02:52:01,000
But the thing I when I was in college what I wanted to do oh fuck

2518
02:52:05,000 --> 02:52:07,000
Damn it

2519
02:52:08,000 --> 02:52:13,000
I've wanted to do like voice work voice acting acting in general

2520
02:52:14,000 --> 02:52:15,000
I

2521
02:52:15,000 --> 02:52:20,000
After being a magic wand maker I wanted to uh not to be like an actor

2522
02:52:31,000 --> 02:52:34,000
Where did I meet star shoot many a tournament

2523
02:52:36,000 --> 02:52:39,000
That's like the first time we ever saw each other in real life

2524
02:52:39,000 --> 02:52:41,000
I

2525
02:52:41,000 --> 02:52:44,000
Think like we needed another person for the shoot mania team and

2526
02:52:45,000 --> 02:52:50,000
Him and I just barely kind of started talking like just barely and I was like oh

2527
02:52:50,000 --> 02:52:55,000
I know the perfect guy for the shoot mania team. He's like we could go to like a quake style games and TF2 and

2528
02:52:56,000 --> 02:52:58,000
Oh, his name is his name star

2529
02:52:59,000 --> 02:53:02,000
I like it. Of course. Oh my god you fucker. Oh

2530
02:53:04,000 --> 02:53:06,000
My goodness

2531
02:53:07,000 --> 02:53:09,000
crap

2532
02:53:10,000 --> 02:53:12,000
Yeah, and it was me orb

2533
02:53:14,000 --> 02:53:16,000
mlc stealth

2534
02:53:16,000 --> 02:53:19,000
And star and I think it was orb couldn't play

2535
02:53:20,000 --> 02:53:25,000
Because it was a us only tournament you couldn't be from anywhere else around the world or something

2536
02:53:26,000 --> 02:53:30,000
So orb was like oh shit. I can't play in this tournament

2537
02:53:31,000 --> 02:53:35,000
And originally I think we're gonna get shibi was gonna fill but then it was like star and I think shibi

2538
02:53:36,000 --> 02:53:38,000
No, it was it could be either one of them was who was gonna be

2539
02:53:39,000 --> 02:53:40,000
But started up

2540
02:53:40,000 --> 02:53:45,000
Filling that spot and him and mlc stealth well mlc stealth just carried that entire time we played

2541
02:53:46,000 --> 02:53:48,000
That was so cool

2542
02:53:48,000 --> 02:53:52,000
I will go down as one of my favorite things like in like my gaming quote how long have been playing games

2543
02:53:53,000 --> 02:53:57,000
Was like winning that tournament like being on that team and like being able to go to e3

2544
02:53:59,000 --> 02:54:03,000
Was like I just I had to do that. I was gonna get hit thousand times

2545
02:54:05,000 --> 02:54:07,000
You

2546
02:54:17,000 --> 02:54:20,000
You realize you have a entire two-hour stream posted where you do will calm the star

2547
02:54:21,000 --> 02:54:25,000
Yeah, but I mean we weren't like we weren't like friends and we didn't really hang out

2548
02:54:26,000 --> 02:54:31,000
I thought the question was like when did I like meet and like start hanging out with star like we talked

2549
02:54:32,000 --> 02:54:40,000
Not a whole lot like it was sometimes we were talked but it was really that like shoot mania tournament is when we started to become like real friends

2550
02:54:42,000 --> 02:54:48,000
Everything before that was kind of like I kind of know you a little bit. I don't really know yet all but you know hi

2551
02:54:51,000 --> 02:54:53,000
That was when our friendship started

2552
02:55:01,000 --> 02:55:03,000
He locked in

2553
02:55:11,000 --> 02:55:13,000
Any regrets

2554
02:55:14,000 --> 02:55:16,000
Everybody has regrets

2555
02:55:19,000 --> 02:55:26,000
Not really but I mean like yeah, I like shouldn't have eaten that taco in college when I was like had like colitis

2556
02:55:28,000 --> 02:55:30,000
Yeah, that's a pretty best of regret

2557
02:55:31,000 --> 02:55:33,000
You

2558
02:55:36,000 --> 02:55:38,000

03:13:25,000 --> 03:13:27,000
Just I

2732
03:13:28,000 --> 03:13:30,000
How come he's not shooting anything

2733
03:13:37,000 --> 03:13:41,000
Always doing flies but that's not I didn't want I wanted them to shoot out the

2734
03:13:42,000 --> 03:13:44,000
Second double brimstone

2735
03:13:48,000 --> 03:13:54,000
Where is it? It's down here

2736
03:13:58,000 --> 03:14:06,000
All right place your bets am I gonna get hit before I can uh use this in this room. I'm gonna hit five times

2737
03:14:06,000 --> 03:14:08,000
Oh

2738
03:14:15,000 --> 03:14:17,000
Oh he doesn't he doesn't copy brimstone

2739
03:14:20,000 --> 03:14:22,000
Okay

2740
03:14:27,000 --> 03:14:29,000
Well, you just instantly insta died

2741
03:14:31,000 --> 03:14:33,000
Figure what answers does

2742
03:14:33,000 --> 03:14:35,000
I

2743
03:14:36,000 --> 03:14:39,000
I feel like I shouldn't take that because doesn't that make everything a uh

2744
03:14:42,000 --> 03:14:44,000
The bad bloody chest

2745
03:14:51,000 --> 03:14:53,000
He's got to kind of get him in a way

2746
03:14:53,000 --> 03:14:55,000
Oh

2747
03:14:59,000 --> 03:15:01,000
He should tag of the flies

2748
03:15:12,000 --> 03:15:14,000
That doesn't do anything does it

2749
03:15:15,000 --> 03:15:17,000
Oh

2750
03:15:17,000 --> 03:15:19,000
Look at how long that is now

2751
03:15:23,000 --> 03:15:33,000
But does does that do me no does no synergy there I don't think

2752
03:15:37,000 --> 03:15:40,000
Damn it I thought that was gonna be synergizing

2753
03:15:45,000 --> 03:15:47,000
Is it more

2754
03:15:48,000 --> 03:15:50,000
Maybe it is

2755
03:15:53,000 --> 03:15:55,000
I

2756
03:15:56,000 --> 03:15:58,000
Can do the pa again if I really wanted to

2757
03:16:01,000 --> 03:16:04,000
How much of this game have I played like maybe 70 or 75 hours

2758
03:16:05,000 --> 03:16:10,000
The problem with Isaac though is if you don't I I'd never played

2759
03:16:12,000 --> 03:16:15,000
All my time in Isaac was when it first came out

2760
03:16:15,000 --> 03:16:21,000
So it's bit literally up until like a couple weeks ago or so was it's been like probably like a year since I played it

2761
03:16:22,000 --> 03:16:24,000
So I just forget everything that's in the game

2762
03:16:24,000 --> 03:16:30,000
And even still I was one of those wiki people I needed to use the wiki because I just didn't know every that I always forgot what stuff did

2763
03:16:41,000 --> 03:16:43,000
Come on that was blinking I did it

2764
03:16:52,000 --> 03:16:54,000
Oh

2765
03:16:57,000 --> 03:16:59,000
Not 4.50

2766
03:17:01,000 --> 03:17:04,000
Yeah, at least the flies will kill things while I'm charging that is correct

2767
03:17:16,000 --> 03:17:18,000
Most flies really are doing work

2768
03:17:21,000 --> 03:17:23,000
Oh

2769
03:17:26,000 --> 03:17:28,000
Just go oh no no no no way way

2770
03:17:38,000 --> 03:17:40,000
And shit to you

2771
03:17:52,000 --> 03:17:54,000
Getting all my hearts back that's a good thing

2772
03:18:03,000 --> 03:18:06,000
If I find the broken remote with the pa take it infinite teleports

2773
03:18:07,000 --> 03:18:09,000
Could go down and explore but whatever

2774
03:18:22,000 --> 03:18:31,000
Well you hit him oh my god thank you thank you thank you thank you thank you

2775
03:18:33,000 --> 03:18:35,000
Nothing in this room

2776
03:18:36,000 --> 03:18:38,000
Oh

2777
03:18:45,000 --> 03:18:49,000
How's auto doing fantastic he's right behind me

2778
03:18:50,000 --> 03:18:55,000
Sleeping being a good boy if you heard me say his name so he looked up over here

2779
03:18:57,000 --> 03:18:59,000
He's a good dog

2780
03:18:59,000 --> 03:19:01,000
He's my little buddy

2781
03:19:06,000 --> 03:19:15,000
This is really really good though

2782
03:19:17,000 --> 03:19:23,000
The only bad part about this is besides the flies it takes me forever to I it takes me forever to do a ton of damage

2783
03:19:25,000 --> 03:19:27,000
Gonna make sure I'm hitting things

2784
03:19:29,000 --> 03:19:31,000
This is pretty sweet

2785
03:19:32,000 --> 03:19:34,000
Oh

2786
03:19:35,000 --> 03:19:37,000
Oh boy

2787
03:19:37,000 --> 03:19:39,000
Oh boy

2788
03:19:39,000 --> 03:19:43,000
Would you look at that now we're talking

2789
03:19:51,000 --> 03:19:53,000
Shit's gonna uh

2790
03:19:53,000 --> 03:19:58,000
Shit's gonna really start to uh hit the fan if I get the familiar upgrade

2791
03:20:01,000 --> 03:20:03,000
Yes

2792
03:20:05,000 --> 03:20:31,000
D

2793
03:20:31,000 --> 03:20:33,000
I waited so long and everything.

2794
03:20:43,000 --> 03:20:45,000
Even more health.

2795
03:20:46,000 --> 03:20:48,000
Oh, but, but, but, but.

2796
03:20:49,000 --> 03:20:50,000
Hmm.

2797
03:20:53,000 --> 03:20:58,000
I could do the paw again and then take the book.

2798
03:21:01,000 --> 03:21:03,000
What do you think, guys?

2799
03:21:04,000 --> 03:21:06,000
What do you think?

2800
03:21:07,000 --> 03:21:09,000
What do you think, guys?

2801
03:21:10,000 --> 03:21:12,000
What do you think?

2802
03:21:21,000 --> 03:21:24,000
Use the paw, grab the book and get the cat.

2803
03:21:31,000 --> 03:21:33,000
Ha, ha, ha, ha descendants.

2804
03:21:39,000 --> 03:21:41,000
Get the cat, you have nothing to lose.

2805
03:21:41,000 --> 03:21:43,000
I don't know if I want to get the cat.

2806
03:21:45,000 --> 03:21:47,000
I'm really skinned to book a polio.

2807
03:21:48,000 --> 03:21:50,000
Because that's just outrageous.

2808
03:21:55,000 --> 03:21:57,000
Yeah, I hate that item.

2809
03:21:58,000 --> 03:22:00,000
I really don't like the cat item.

2810
03:22:01,000 --> 03:22:03,000
I'm gonna go on our merry way.

2811
03:22:03,000 --> 03:22:05,000
I'll just take the book.

2812
03:22:09,000 --> 03:22:11,000
I still need to go into...

2813
03:22:13,000 --> 03:22:15,000
I didn't miss the item, rum.

2814
03:22:16,000 --> 03:22:18,000
Yeah, I don't care. We're just gonna go.

2815
03:22:19,000 --> 03:22:22,000
Hey, guess what? Bet you I get hit by this shit again.

2816
03:22:24,000 --> 03:22:25,000
Nope.

2817
03:22:32,000 --> 03:22:35,000
Take the cat, take the cat.

2818
03:22:35,000 --> 03:22:37,000
Fine, I'll take the cat.

2819
03:22:37,000 --> 03:22:38,000
You want me to take the cat?

2820
03:22:38,000 --> 03:22:40,000
Tuck the cat.

2821
03:22:41,000 --> 03:22:45,000
Now I got nine lives and it's gonna, I'm gonna get two confident.

2822
03:22:45,000 --> 03:22:47,000
And I'm gonna die nine times.

2823
03:22:51,000 --> 03:22:53,000
Oh, the cat gives you a heart.

2824
03:22:56,000 --> 03:22:57,000
Whoops.

2825
03:23:02,000 --> 03:23:06,000
What a washed out, what a, what a washed up video game player.

2826
03:23:16,000 --> 03:23:20,000
Everyone's saying to go back, I want the book of, I want the book.

2827
03:23:20,000 --> 03:23:22,000
Do you know how much damage I want to be doing?

2828
03:23:24,000 --> 03:23:26,000
I don't care about, it's a guppy.

2829
03:23:28,000 --> 03:23:30,000
See, I want to be able to go like this.

2830
03:23:30,000 --> 03:23:32,000
See, now I go.

2831
03:23:42,000 --> 03:23:43,000
What a shit rum.

2832
03:23:49,000 --> 03:23:51,000
What the shit rum that was.

2833
03:24:01,000 --> 03:24:10,000
If this was original Isaac, yeah, I maybe I'm putting two together.

2834
03:24:18,000 --> 03:24:20,000
Watch out everybody.

2835
03:24:20,000 --> 03:24:21,000
Don't get blown up.

2836
03:24:31,000 --> 03:24:33,000
Fill up your mouth, let's go.

2837
03:24:40,000 --> 03:24:41,000
Hmm.

2838
03:24:43,000 --> 03:24:45,000
Range up, I'll take it.

2839
03:24:48,000 --> 03:24:50,000
It's going to define some stuff.

2840
03:24:54,000 --> 03:24:57,000
I don't know the chance, like the chances are me getting more guppy.

2841
03:24:57,000 --> 03:24:59,000
I mean, what is the actual chances here?

2842
03:25:01,000 --> 03:25:05,000
If it happens, it happens, you know, but I don't know.

2843
03:25:05,000 --> 03:25:09,000
I never want to rely, you can never rely on something dropping in this game.

2844
03:25:10,000 --> 03:25:12,000
Because everything is just random.

2845
03:25:14,000 --> 03:25:17,000
Everything's just randomized, it's a randomized dungeon.

2846
03:25:17,000 --> 03:25:19,000
I don't know what is going on with this game.

2847
03:25:19,000 --> 03:25:21,000
I don't know what is going to happen with this game.

2848
03:25:27,000 --> 03:25:30,000
Oh god.

2849
03:25:30,000 --> 03:25:32,000
Oh god, damn it.

2850
03:25:32,000 --> 03:25:34,000
Come on.

2851
03:25:34,000 --> 03:25:38,000
I fucking hate these things.

2852
03:25:38,000 --> 03:25:41,000
I thought she wouldn't have this close.

2853
03:25:47,000 --> 03:25:52,000
spider box.

2854
03:25:52,000 --> 03:25:59,000
Not that. Not as good as Book of the Lyle.

2855
03:25:59,000 --> 03:26:04,000
We could go in the coin shop today.

2856
03:26:04,000 --> 03:26:11,000
I'm going to scream.

2857
03:26:12,000 --> 03:26:18,000
I'm going to just scream at the top of my lungs.

2858
03:26:24,000 --> 03:26:31,000
Gonna fucking start screaming.

2859
03:26:42,000 --> 03:26:48,000
Okay, so I have one heart, right? Or two hearts?

2860
03:26:48,000 --> 03:26:55,000
Shit.

2861
03:27:00,000 --> 03:27:05,000
It's pretty handy.

2862
03:27:06,000 --> 03:27:11,000
I got two hearts.

2863
03:27:11,000 --> 03:27:18,000
I really have just been kind of skipping the secret rooms, unfortunately.

2864
03:27:18,000 --> 03:27:23,000
But we're just trying to go.

2865
03:27:23,000 --> 03:27:30,000
You know, we're just going.

2866
03:27:30,000 --> 03:27:33,000
You're going to give me another one of these?

2867
03:27:33,000 --> 03:27:38,000
You're going to give me another one of these with an obstacle in the way?

2868
03:27:38,000 --> 03:27:43,000
I have to go around that.

2869
03:27:43,000 --> 03:27:48,000
How annoying.

2870
03:27:48,000 --> 03:27:53,000
Come on.

2871
03:27:53,000 --> 03:27:58,000
I think I go.

2872
03:27:58,000 --> 03:28:03,000
I have to go back.

2873
03:28:03,000 --> 03:28:08,000
I hate those rums with a passion.

2874
03:28:08,000 --> 03:28:13,000
Here we go.

2875
03:28:13,000 --> 03:28:18,000
Let's go again.

2876
03:28:18,000 --> 03:28:25,000
Let's jump in all over the place.

2877
03:28:25,000 --> 03:28:30,000
You stop moving, dude.

2878
03:28:30,000 --> 03:28:37,000
I still have some hearts.

2879
03:28:37,000 --> 03:28:44,000
Okay.

2880
03:28:44,000 --> 03:28:51,000
What's your favorite flavor of ice cream?

2881
03:28:51,000 --> 03:28:54,000
Pretty much just standard chocolate.

2882
03:28:54,000 --> 03:28:59,000
If it's not standard chocolate, then it's what I said earlier, like the Fudge Brownie ice cream from Ben and Jerry's.

2883
03:28:59,000 --> 03:29:02,000
It's crazy.

2884
03:29:02,000 --> 03:29:05,000
Actually, I don't remember the name of it.

2885
03:29:05,000 --> 03:29:09,000
It's like double Fudge Ultra Fudge Brownie guy mode.

2886
03:29:09,000 --> 03:29:15,000
All Ben and Jerry's ice cream has weird screwy, Louis names.

2887
03:29:15,000 --> 03:29:20,000
Chip and Dale's rescue ranger, Raspberry, lime, Ricky.

2888
03:29:20,000 --> 03:29:21,000
Okay.

2889
03:29:21,000 --> 03:29:28,000
Could just call it Raspberry Ice Cream.

2890
03:29:28,000 --> 03:29:38,000
Where's the last one?

2891
03:29:38,000 --> 03:29:41,000
There you are.

2892
03:29:41,000 --> 03:29:42,000
Fish food.

2893
03:29:42,000 --> 03:29:43,000
Yeah, fish food's good.

2894
03:29:43,000 --> 03:29:46,000
That's more of the marshmallow, right?

2895
03:29:46,000 --> 03:29:49,000
The chocolate pieces.

2896
03:29:49,000 --> 03:29:51,000
Half baked is good.

2897
03:29:51,000 --> 03:30:04,000
Almost all of the Ben and Jerry's ice cream is good.

2898
03:30:04,000 --> 03:30:12,000
Where is he?

2899
03:30:12,000 --> 03:30:14,000
Is that do anything?

2900
03:30:14,000 --> 03:30:18,000
How does that pulse us?

2901
03:30:18,000 --> 03:30:21,000
It does.

2902
03:30:21,000 --> 03:30:22,000
It does.

2903
03:30:22,000 --> 03:30:28,000
That's neat.

2904
03:30:28,000 --> 03:30:41,000
That's a real neat.

2905
03:30:41,000 --> 03:30:51,000
All of them just hit that guy in the face.

2906
03:30:51,000 --> 03:31:02,000
Trying just to make one of them hit him.

2907
03:31:02,000 --> 03:31:12,000
Get it back.

2908
03:31:12,000 --> 03:31:22,000
Get it back.

2909
03:31:22,000 --> 03:31:31,000
Shoot.

2910
03:31:31,000 --> 03:31:35,000
I got money to spend.

2911
03:31:35,000 --> 03:31:36,000
Can I see the chat?

2912
03:31:36,000 --> 03:31:41,000
Of course I can.

2913
03:31:41,000 --> 03:32:00,000
Of course I can see the chat.

2914
03:32:00,000 --> 03:32:06,000
A black heart.

2915
03:32:06,000 --> 03:32:09,000
I'm getting so many HP ops.

2916
03:32:09,000 --> 03:32:16,000
This game really wants me to stay alive with the current build that I have.

2917
03:32:16,000 --> 03:32:27,000
I'll just take that for this room and then I'm going to throw it away.

2918
03:32:27,000 --> 03:32:33,000
Thank you for the numerous hilarious videos of Brighton in my life.

2919
03:32:33,000 --> 03:32:35,000
You're welcome, dude.

2920
03:32:35,000 --> 03:32:39,000
Thanks for even carrying about them in the first place.

2921
03:32:39,000 --> 03:32:43,000
I should be thanking you.

2922
03:32:43,000 --> 03:32:47,000
Oh!

2923
03:32:47,000 --> 03:32:49,000
There it is.

2924
03:32:49,000 --> 03:32:53,000
There's the item.

2925
03:32:53,000 --> 03:32:57,000
There it is.

2926
03:32:57,000 --> 03:33:03,000
That's what we like to call a good game.

2927
03:33:03,000 --> 03:33:09,000
Look at this troop I got now.

2928
03:33:09,000 --> 03:33:11,000
Nice.

2929
03:33:11,000 --> 03:33:15,000
Oh wow, that's amazing.

2930
03:33:15,000 --> 03:33:20,000
Well, I'm going to just take this for fun.

2931
03:33:20,000 --> 03:33:23,000
Whatever.

2932
03:33:23,000 --> 03:33:30,000
Let's go ahead and win this one.

2933
03:33:30,000 --> 03:33:34,000
If you don't know what that does, that makes all of my familiars do more damage.

2934
03:33:34,000 --> 03:33:35,000
They're just even better.

2935
03:33:35,000 --> 03:33:38,000
They grow stronger and they get more powerful.

2936
03:33:38,000 --> 03:33:47,000
But what I'm doing right now, this is unbelievable.

2937
03:33:47,000 --> 03:33:50,000
I guess I could start hurting.

2938
03:33:50,000 --> 03:33:52,000
I don't even...

2939
03:33:52,000 --> 03:33:54,000
luck up.

2940
03:33:54,000 --> 03:33:57,000
Just I don't even care.

2941
03:33:57,000 --> 03:34:01,000
I could just farm all this, but I have plenty of items.

2942
03:34:01,000 --> 03:34:05,000
I have plenty of bombs, plenty of keys.

2943
03:34:05,000 --> 03:34:13,000
I could get the blood bag or something, but who really cares?

2944
03:34:13,000 --> 03:34:15,000
Do I have donation set up?

2945
03:34:15,000 --> 03:34:17,000
No, I answered this before.

2946
03:34:18,000 --> 03:34:21,000
I'm not doing donations.

2947
03:34:21,000 --> 03:34:32,000
At least for the foreseeable future.

2948
03:34:32,000 --> 03:34:44,000
And that did a lot.

2949
03:34:44,000 --> 03:34:53,000
See you later, Mom.

2950
03:34:53,000 --> 03:34:55,000
Okay, did I win?

2951
03:34:55,000 --> 03:34:57,000
I think I won.

2952
03:34:57,000 --> 03:34:59,000
Did I win?

2953
03:34:59,000 --> 03:35:00,000
Guys, I won.

2954
03:35:00,000 --> 03:35:02,000
I did it.

2955
03:35:02,000 --> 03:35:03,000
I did it, guys.

2956
03:35:03,000 --> 03:35:05,000
I did it.

2957
03:35:05,000 --> 03:35:08,000
Yeah.

2958
03:35:08,000 --> 03:35:12,000
What the fuck?

2959
03:35:12,000 --> 03:35:19,000
Ah, I won the video game.

2960
03:35:19,000 --> 03:35:28,000
I won the video game.

2961
03:35:28,000 --> 03:35:33,000
Look at me.

2962
03:35:33,000 --> 03:35:39,000
If I lose this game, I'm going to uninstall Isaac.

2963
03:35:39,000 --> 03:35:53,000
If I don't at least beat like Mum's heart, something's wrong.

2964
03:35:53,000 --> 03:36:03,000
Now let's take the book.

2965
03:36:04,000 --> 03:36:06,000
Okay, I'm not going to take that.

2966
03:36:06,000 --> 03:36:09,000
That's too much.

2967
03:36:09,000 --> 03:36:14,000
Look at a little cat.

2968
03:36:14,000 --> 03:36:20,000
That was the end.

2969
03:36:20,000 --> 03:36:26,000
It's almost physically impossible for me not to at least get to Isaac.

2970
03:36:26,000 --> 03:36:32,000
If you don't understand what happened, if you pick up, it's three items in the guppy, quote, guppy line.

2971
03:36:32,000 --> 03:36:41,000
If you will, you turn into a guppy, the cat, and you just steamroll every single room.

2972
03:36:41,000 --> 03:36:48,000
Pretty much.

2973
03:36:48,000 --> 03:36:55,000
Alright, let's go.

2974
03:36:55,000 --> 03:36:56,000
Let's see.

2975
03:36:56,000 --> 03:36:59,000
Let's see what a guppy can do.

2976
03:36:59,000 --> 03:37:01,000
Let's move.

2977
03:37:02,000 --> 03:37:03,000
Whoops.

2978
03:37:03,000 --> 03:37:07,000
Uninstall hype.

2979
03:37:07,000 --> 03:37:09,000
Uninstall hype, guys.

2980
03:37:09,000 --> 03:37:12,000
I just took that damage I should not have taken.

2981
03:37:12,000 --> 03:37:16,000
Uninstall hype.

2982
03:37:16,000 --> 03:37:18,000
Got these flies.

2983
03:37:18,000 --> 03:37:20,000
Ah, there's so many of them.

2984
03:37:20,000 --> 03:37:27,000
I think this is actually only the second time I've ever had guppy.

2985
03:37:27,000 --> 03:37:32,000
Come and get me.

2986
03:37:32,000 --> 03:37:36,000
Now we just pull out through the whole game.

2987
03:37:36,000 --> 03:37:38,000
I'm just going through every room out of the cave.

2988
03:37:38,000 --> 03:37:39,000
We're not even like stopping.

2989
03:37:39,000 --> 03:37:43,000
I'm only going to stop to charge before I go into room.

2990
03:37:43,000 --> 03:37:47,000
Okay, no hold on, we're going to stop here.

2991
03:37:47,000 --> 03:37:52,000
The range up, yes.

2992
03:37:52,000 --> 03:37:54,000
Okay, the rest of those are paralysis.

2993
03:37:54,000 --> 03:37:56,000
I'm just going to fly over objects to God.

2994
03:37:56,000 --> 03:38:00,000
What an unbeatable item.

2995
03:38:00,000 --> 03:38:05,000
I'll just take the case I need it for some reason.

2996
03:38:05,000 --> 03:38:07,000
Oh, thanks, thanks for the heart.

2997
03:38:07,000 --> 03:38:14,000
Thanks for the more free stuff.

2998
03:38:14,000 --> 03:38:20,000
Ha.

2999
03:38:20,000 --> 03:38:22,000
Turn on what is your real name?

3000
03:38:22,000 --> 03:38:26,000
It's Arnold Albertson.

3001
03:38:26,000 --> 03:38:28,000
Uninstall.

3002
03:38:28,000 --> 03:38:30,000
Uninstall in the game.

3003
03:38:30,000 --> 03:38:33,000
Took another hit.

3004
03:38:33,000 --> 03:38:34,000
I should be taking zero hits.

3005
03:38:34,000 --> 03:38:44,000
I think I'm just getting overconfident.

3006
03:38:44,000 --> 03:38:46,000
Oh, overconfidence, man.

3007
03:38:46,000 --> 03:38:53,000
It's going to be the death of me.

3008
03:38:53,000 --> 03:38:56,000
At least I know those things will never touch me.

3009
03:38:56,000 --> 03:39:02,000
What boss isn't here that's going to insta die?

3010
03:39:02,000 --> 03:39:05,000
See you.

3011
03:39:05,000 --> 03:39:08,000
Another another devorow.

3012
03:39:08,000 --> 03:39:11,000
Oh my God.

3013
03:39:11,000 --> 03:39:14,000
Another one, another one.

3014
03:39:14,000 --> 03:39:18,000
I'm not even going to be able to see.

3015
03:39:18,000 --> 03:39:21,000
There's just so many people.

3016
03:39:21,000 --> 03:39:32,000
There's too many people on the screen.

3017
03:39:32,000 --> 03:39:36,000
My friends.

3018
03:39:36,000 --> 03:39:39,000
I mean, I didn't have to do that, but you kind of have to.

3019
03:39:39,000 --> 03:39:41,000
If you have this setup, don't you?

3020
03:39:41,000 --> 03:39:42,000
Why not?

3021
03:39:42,000 --> 03:39:46,000
I'm not doing Brimstone.

3022
03:39:46,000 --> 03:39:48,000
I already have this.

3023
03:39:48,000 --> 03:39:54,000
And I already have Guppy, so I'm not taking two full hearts for no reason.

3024
03:39:54,000 --> 03:39:56,000
I like the super spit.

3025
03:39:56,000 --> 03:39:58,000
And then there's this.

3026
03:39:58,000 --> 03:40:01,000
I can go like this and fly.

3027
03:40:01,000 --> 03:40:03,000
But there's no reason to have that.

3028
03:40:03,000 --> 03:40:08,000
I'm going to keep the book.

3029
03:40:08,000 --> 03:40:10,000
I'm not getting Brimstone.

3030
03:40:10,000 --> 03:40:13,000
We want to have like a party.

3031
03:40:13,000 --> 03:40:17,000
Oh, the book of a lot of the book of the Liles doing that, right?

3032
03:40:17,000 --> 03:40:19,000
Okay, let's go.

3033
03:40:19,000 --> 03:40:21,000
Oh, that's not Brimstone.

3034
03:40:21,000 --> 03:40:26,000
Oh, Brimstone has the two lines in it, right?

3035
03:40:26,000 --> 03:40:28,000
Curse of darkness.

3036
03:40:28,000 --> 03:40:31,000
Oh no.

3037
03:40:31,000 --> 03:40:33,000
Whatever will I do.

3038
03:40:33,000 --> 03:40:37,000
I can't see, but it doesn't matter.

3039
03:40:37,000 --> 03:40:45,000
It just doesn't matter.

3040
03:40:45,000 --> 03:40:47,000
I have a machine gun of flies.

3041
03:40:47,000 --> 03:40:53,000
Nothing can stop me.

3042
03:40:53,000 --> 03:41:06,000
Just going, y'all, give me that key.

3043
03:41:06,000 --> 03:41:09,000
I can't see the flies.

3044
03:41:09,000 --> 03:41:14,000
Remember I said what was the percentage of me actually getting guppy?

3045
03:41:14,000 --> 03:41:18,000
And I got it.

3046
03:41:18,000 --> 03:41:24,000
Is it get it or you don't, right?

3047
03:41:24,000 --> 03:41:26,000
It was hide over here too.

3048
03:41:26,000 --> 03:41:30,000
Is this such a joke?

3049
03:41:36,000 --> 03:41:41,000
Have I played the eternal mode?

3050
03:41:41,000 --> 03:41:42,000
Then Binding Visek 1?

3051
03:41:42,000 --> 03:41:43,000
No.

3052
03:41:43,000 --> 03:41:44,000
Didn't they updated it?

3053
03:41:44,000 --> 03:41:45,000
Binding Visek didn't they?

3054
03:41:45,000 --> 03:41:46,000
The original?

3055
03:41:46,000 --> 03:41:49,000
Didn't they add stuff to it or something?

3056
03:41:49,000 --> 03:42:03,000
Is that what they added?

3057
03:42:03,000 --> 03:42:06,000
And here we go.

3058
03:42:06,000 --> 03:42:22,000
Let's do it.

3059
03:42:22,000 --> 03:42:29,000
Melting melted cheese.

3060
03:42:29,000 --> 03:42:33,000
That is so awesome.

3061
03:42:33,000 --> 03:42:34,000
Although, hold on a second.

3062
03:42:34,000 --> 03:42:41,000
Did I not, I don't think I got the Polaroid.

3063
03:42:41,000 --> 03:42:42,000
Did I get the Polaroid in mom?

3064
03:42:42,000 --> 03:42:45,000
Should I just go try to be taken?

3065
03:42:45,000 --> 03:42:47,000
Or just be Isaac?

3066
03:42:47,000 --> 03:42:50,000
The Polaroid is for...

3067
03:42:50,000 --> 03:42:52,000
I don't even remember.

3068
03:42:52,000 --> 03:42:54,000
Eternal mode really isn't that fun.

3069
03:42:54,000 --> 03:42:57,000
Just some new boss effects that happen sometimes.

3070
03:42:57,000 --> 03:42:59,000
I did get it.

3071
03:42:59,000 --> 03:43:00,000
Let's go.

3072
03:43:00,000 --> 03:43:06,000
Let's go to the Cathedral.

3073
03:43:06,000 --> 03:43:07,000
Okay.

3074
03:43:07,000 --> 03:43:09,000
Are we uninstalling the game?

3075
03:43:09,000 --> 03:43:12,000
We'll find out very soon.

3076
03:43:28,000 --> 03:43:31,000
You got it.

3077
03:43:31,000 --> 03:43:34,000
Jeremy, where me?

3078
03:43:34,000 --> 03:43:38,000
Jeremy, where me?

3079
03:43:38,000 --> 03:43:46,000
Oh, it's stuck out.

3080
03:43:46,000 --> 03:43:50,000
The reason why I got hit is I didn't realize it was one of those green guys.

3081
03:43:50,000 --> 03:43:55,000
I wouldn't have gotten hit if I didn't though.

3082
03:43:55,000 --> 03:44:08,000
It's weird to see the Polaroid unlock before the negative.

3083
03:44:08,000 --> 03:44:14,000
What is the criteria for unlocking the negative?

3084
03:44:14,000 --> 03:44:20,000
I don't think I have it.

3085
03:44:20,000 --> 03:44:23,000
Can you spend your 50 gerbobox on that question?

3086
03:44:24,000 --> 03:44:26,000
But that was your question.

3087
03:44:26,000 --> 03:44:28,000
So, there it is.

3088
03:44:28,000 --> 03:44:29,000
Tented rock.

3089
03:44:29,000 --> 03:44:35,000
I missed it, but I'll get it.

3090
03:44:35,000 --> 03:44:40,000
Can't give up a Tented Rock at this point in the game.

3091
03:44:40,000 --> 03:44:42,000
Satan five times.

3092
03:44:42,000 --> 03:44:45,000
I've beaten megastatin, I think, two or three times.

3093
03:44:45,000 --> 03:44:51,000
I might just keep going to the Cathedral.

3094
03:44:51,000 --> 03:44:53,000
I'm pretty sure that's what's going on.

3095
03:44:53,000 --> 03:44:55,000
I don't like go fight, Satan.

3096
03:44:55,000 --> 03:44:58,000
I always go to fight Isaac.

3097
03:44:58,000 --> 03:45:08,000
Whenever I get there, I don't know how many times it's been.

3098
03:45:08,000 --> 03:45:15,000
I hate these jump characters.

3099
03:45:21,000 --> 03:45:25,000
Okay.

3100
03:45:25,000 --> 03:45:28,000
Let's do it.

3101
03:45:52,000 --> 03:45:56,000
Uninstall the game.

3102
03:45:56,000 --> 03:45:58,000
Very good idea.

3103
03:45:58,000 --> 03:46:02,000
I don't have to uninstall the game.

3104
03:46:02,000 --> 03:46:09,000
I did not have to uninstall the biting of Isaac.

3105
03:46:13,000 --> 03:46:16,000
Oh my god.

3106
03:46:16,000 --> 03:46:19,000
Dude, this...

3107
03:46:19,000 --> 03:46:24,000
There's too many people.

3108
03:46:24,000 --> 03:46:32,000
This is... I've never seen this many familiar.

3109
03:46:32,000 --> 03:46:37,000
I'm... this is going to confuse me now.

3110
03:46:37,000 --> 03:46:39,000
Try to just get the orbit thing too.

3111
03:46:39,000 --> 03:46:44,000
Should I just get orbit?

3112
03:46:44,000 --> 03:46:49,000
Dude, care is right.

3113
03:46:49,000 --> 03:46:51,000
Don't pick up that, plan.

3114
03:46:51,000 --> 03:46:53,000
Do not pick up that plan.

3115
03:46:53,000 --> 03:46:54,000
Okay, fine.

3116
03:46:54,000 --> 03:47:02,000
We'll just... we'll just lose here.

3117
03:47:02,000 --> 03:47:06,000
I honestly might lose to... is it Blue Baby?

3118
03:47:06,000 --> 03:47:13,000
Because I don't... I don't like him remember what he does.

3119
03:47:15,000 --> 03:47:21,000
I might just lose here.

3120
03:47:21,000 --> 03:47:28,000
I'm not going to lie.

3121
03:47:28,000 --> 03:47:33,000
That technology baby is kind of freaking me out.

3122
03:47:33,000 --> 03:47:42,000
Like I keep seeing it and I keep thinking it's an enemy of some sort.

3123
03:47:43,000 --> 03:47:47,000
Can I hurt this fucking dude?

3124
03:47:56,000 --> 03:48:00,000
Get the contact.

3125
03:48:00,000 --> 03:48:06,000
Oh, you asshole.

3126
03:48:13,000 --> 03:48:19,000
Even more flies.

3127
03:48:23,000 --> 03:48:30,000
Get in my fly brethren.

3128
03:48:43,000 --> 03:48:46,000
Hope this is the right way.

3129
03:48:46,000 --> 03:48:47,000
What the fuck?

3130
03:48:47,000 --> 03:48:48,000
Oh, come on.

3131
03:48:48,000 --> 03:48:51,000
You didn't just really do that to me, baby.

3132
03:48:51,000 --> 03:48:54,000
Oh fuck.

3133
03:48:54,000 --> 03:48:57,000
What the hell?

3134
03:48:57,000 --> 03:49:00,000
Uh-oh.

3135
03:49:00,000 --> 03:49:06,000
Uh-oh.

3136
03:49:06,000 --> 03:49:11,000
The baby's ended up screwing me over there, guys.

3137
03:49:13,000 --> 03:49:17,000
Don't, don't, don't, don't, don't do that.

3138
03:49:17,000 --> 03:49:19,000
Oh my fucking god.

3139
03:49:19,000 --> 03:49:24,000
Come on.

3140
03:49:24,000 --> 03:49:27,000
Slow down.

3141
03:49:27,000 --> 03:49:29,000
Slow the fuck down.

3142
03:49:29,000 --> 03:49:31,000
Why am I getting hit by these?

3143
03:49:31,000 --> 03:49:38,000
Why am I getting hit by these?

3144
03:49:38,000 --> 03:49:39,000
Holy shit.

3145
03:49:39,000 --> 03:49:40,000
Slow down.

3146
03:49:40,000 --> 03:49:48,000
I was moving too fast.

3147
03:49:48,000 --> 03:49:58,000
I was just going too fast and I forgot that I had to slow down right there.

3148
03:49:58,000 --> 03:50:03,000
No, I think that's probably the right way.

3149
03:50:03,000 --> 03:50:06,000
Not like this.

3150
03:50:06,000 --> 03:50:09,000
I've been on that room.

3151
03:50:09,000 --> 03:50:12,000
Hey, by the way, what the fuck, dude?

3152
03:50:12,000 --> 03:50:13,000
Why?

3153
03:50:13,000 --> 03:50:14,000
What the fuck?

3154
03:50:14,000 --> 03:50:15,000
I didn't even move.

3155
03:50:15,000 --> 03:50:17,000
I died when I went in the room.

3156
03:50:17,000 --> 03:50:20,000
I opened the door and died.

3157
03:50:20,000 --> 03:50:21,000
It was like, legit.

3158
03:50:21,000 --> 03:50:23,000
I, you guys saw, I didn't even move.

3159
03:50:23,000 --> 03:50:26,000
I didn't go anywhere.

3160
03:50:26,000 --> 03:50:29,000
Give me a break.

3161
03:50:29,000 --> 03:50:33,000
Am I just like getting blocked out from all my dudes?

3162
03:50:33,000 --> 03:50:40,000
I'm terrified to walk right here.

3163
03:50:40,000 --> 03:50:48,000
It wasn't this way.

3164
03:50:48,000 --> 03:50:49,000
Shit.

3165
03:50:49,000 --> 03:50:57,000
I gotta go back through that stupid ass room.

3166
03:50:57,000 --> 03:51:04,000
Oh my god.

3167
03:51:04,000 --> 03:51:10,000
I keep god of kidding me.

3168
03:51:10,000 --> 03:51:13,000
This is the room that's going to end this whole thing.

3169
03:51:13,000 --> 03:51:22,000
This dumbass fucking room that I'm hitting the hitboxes on these things.

3170
03:51:22,000 --> 03:51:28,000
Go in, please.

3171
03:51:28,000 --> 03:51:37,000
Probably down on it as soon.

3172
03:51:37,000 --> 03:51:44,000
Okay, then.

3173
03:51:44,000 --> 03:51:52,000
I don't know.

3174
03:51:52,000 --> 03:51:59,000
I really use the spirit heart right now.

3175
03:51:59,000 --> 03:52:09,000
Shit.

3176
03:52:09,000 --> 03:52:19,000
I forgot what these guys do.

3177
03:52:19,000 --> 03:52:20,000
Oh, damn it.

3178
03:52:20,000 --> 03:52:24,000
They spawn those things.

3179
03:52:24,000 --> 03:52:29,000
Oh, hey, by the way, Uninstall hype was for Isaac.

3180
03:52:29,000 --> 03:52:30,000
Not this.

3181
03:52:30,000 --> 03:52:36,000
You know, this is nothing to do with Uninstall hype.

3182
03:52:36,000 --> 03:52:37,000
Fuck.

3183
03:52:37,000 --> 03:52:51,000
This is my big game over.

3184
03:52:51,000 --> 03:52:58,000
This room is so hard with one heart.

3185
03:52:58,000 --> 03:53:11,000
No, time to uninstall the game.

3186
03:53:11,000 --> 03:53:14,000
No.

3187
03:53:15,000 --> 03:53:20,000
Ugh.

3188
03:53:20,000 --> 03:53:25,000
There's so many directions where you could die there with one heart.

3189
03:53:25,000 --> 03:53:29,000
I could have just bombed the door.

3190
03:53:29,000 --> 03:53:30,000
Hey, well, it was beating.

3191
03:53:30,000 --> 03:53:32,000
It was getting to Isaac.

3192
03:53:32,000 --> 03:53:33,000
It beating Isaac.

3193
03:53:33,000 --> 03:53:38,000
I even said, I don't think I was going to be able to beat this with like two hearts.

3194
03:53:38,000 --> 03:53:48,000
All I needed to prove was beating Isaac.

3195
03:53:48,000 --> 03:53:51,000
I should have used the fucking orbit.

3196
03:53:51,000 --> 03:53:55,000
That was the problem.

3197
03:53:55,000 --> 03:54:00,000
Oh, you can't even bomb through rooms in the chest.

3198
03:54:00,000 --> 03:54:03,000
Honestly, let's be like real here.

3199
03:54:03,000 --> 03:54:11,000
Trying to beat the chest with one or two hearts is pretty much impossible as it is.

3200
03:54:11,000 --> 03:54:20,000
What really screwed me was the fucking stupid ass hitboxes on the red poo.

3201
03:54:20,000 --> 03:54:21,000
Like, what the fuck was that?

3202
03:54:21,000 --> 03:54:27,000
I would walk in the door like this and die without even touching my controller.

3203
03:54:27,000 --> 03:54:29,000
I would walk in and insta die.

3204
03:54:29,000 --> 03:54:36,000
It happened like three times, at least.

3205
03:54:36,000 --> 03:54:46,000
That was really, really, really annoying.

3206
03:54:46,000 --> 03:54:53,000
Red poo pit boxes are extremely lame, especially when there's three of them in the only area you can move as your character.

3207
03:54:53,000 --> 03:54:57,000
I lost like three hearts there.

3208
03:54:57,000 --> 03:55:00,000
Like, it's legit. Let's be totally real here.

3209
03:55:00,000 --> 03:55:03,000
I went like this and died.

3210
03:55:03,000 --> 03:55:05,000
I didn't even move in.

3211
03:55:05,000 --> 03:55:07,000
I don't touch in anything.

3212
03:55:07,000 --> 03:55:10,000
Just, ugh!

3213
03:55:10,000 --> 03:55:14,000
That was what happened.

3214
03:55:14,000 --> 03:55:16,000
And that brought me down to one.

3215
03:55:16,000 --> 03:55:20,000
Which if I even had more than one hit I could take, that would be great.

3216
03:55:20,000 --> 03:55:30,000
That was really fine.

3217
03:55:30,000 --> 03:55:33,000
Damn it.

3218
03:55:33,000 --> 03:55:35,000
I wanted to beat Isaac.

3219
03:55:35,000 --> 03:55:37,000
I was just chilling.

3220
03:55:37,000 --> 03:55:40,000
That was a very, very incredible build.

3221
03:55:40,000 --> 03:55:41,000
But I will say it.

3222
03:55:41,000 --> 03:55:42,000
I said it before.

3223
03:55:42,000 --> 03:55:43,000
I'll say it again.

3224
03:55:43,000 --> 03:55:47,000
Going into the chest with less than like two or three hearts, you're pretty...

3225
03:55:47,000 --> 03:55:53,000
You have a huge, huge, huge percentage that you're just going to lose.

3226
03:55:53,000 --> 03:56:02,000
Especially those rooms with like two or three of those big, horrible bosses.

3227
03:56:02,000 --> 03:56:04,000
They're very, very hard.

3228
03:56:04,000 --> 03:56:05,000
Especially those two.

3229
03:56:05,000 --> 03:56:11,000
It had to be that fucking guy who spawns the turkeys that shoot in fucking four directions.

3230
03:56:17,000 --> 03:56:24,000
I didn't forget about it in third year.

3231
03:56:24,000 --> 03:56:27,000
I'm taking broom baby.

3232
03:56:27,000 --> 03:56:29,000
I'm not even a real run.

3233
03:56:29,000 --> 03:56:32,000
This is a fake run.

3234
03:56:32,000 --> 03:56:40,000
I'm just venting my frustrations about the red poo hitboxes.

3235
03:56:40,000 --> 03:56:42,000
We all saw it.

3236
03:56:43,000 --> 03:56:45,000
I don't have to pretend like something happened.

3237
03:56:45,000 --> 03:56:49,000
We all saw what happened.

3238
03:56:49,000 --> 03:56:55,000
I'm going to call the gamer police on those guys.

3239
03:56:55,000 --> 03:56:58,000
I'm going to call Ed.

3240
03:56:58,000 --> 03:57:05,000
And be like, Ed, just going on those hitboxes, man.

3241
03:57:05,000 --> 03:57:06,000
I'm upset about it.

3242
03:57:06,000 --> 03:57:09,000
He's going to go, okay.

3243
03:57:09,000 --> 03:57:10,000
And then we're going to hit.

3244
03:57:10,000 --> 03:57:11,000
I'm going to hit.

3245
03:57:11,000 --> 03:57:12,000
We're going to hang up.

3246
03:57:27,000 --> 03:57:32,000
This is not even a fake run.

3247
03:57:32,000 --> 03:57:34,000
I'm pissed off run.

3248
03:57:34,000 --> 03:57:35,000
I'm very upset right now.

3249
03:57:35,000 --> 03:57:38,000
I couldn't be more angry.

3250
03:57:39,000 --> 03:57:49,000
I haven't really been streaming for the second time for four hours.

3251
03:57:49,000 --> 03:57:51,000
Really?

3252
03:57:51,000 --> 03:57:56,000
This is a fake run.

3253
03:57:56,000 --> 03:58:05,000
Don't wish little.

3254
03:58:05,000 --> 03:58:06,000
You know I can't.

3255
03:58:06,000 --> 03:58:08,000
You're going to mock me like that.

3256
03:58:08,000 --> 03:58:11,000
He's only doing that because he knows I can't do it.

3257
03:58:11,000 --> 03:58:14,000
I haven't even fucking real.

3258
03:58:14,000 --> 03:58:40,000
I'm going to uninstall Isaac.

3259
03:58:40,000 --> 03:58:47,000
I'm going to uninstall Isaac.

3260
03:58:47,000 --> 03:58:53,000
I can uninstall Isaac and then immediately reinstall it.

3261
03:58:53,000 --> 03:58:56,000
I can take the game license test again.

3262
03:58:56,000 --> 03:58:57,000
So what?

3263
03:58:57,000 --> 03:59:01,000
You failed your driver's head test?

3264
03:59:01,000 --> 03:59:04,000
You can go, you try it again in like another six months.

3265
03:59:04,000 --> 03:59:05,000
You can pass it.

3266
03:59:05,000 --> 03:59:08,000
I can get my game license back.

3267
03:59:08,000 --> 03:59:23,000
I'm just going to take the test again.

3268
03:59:23,000 --> 03:59:29,000
Fair enough.

3269
03:59:29,000 --> 03:59:31,000
That's a great response.

3270
03:59:31,000 --> 03:59:37,000
Fair enough.

3271
03:59:37,000 --> 04:00:05,000
So much stuff.

3272
04:00:05,000 --> 04:00:15,000
I know that was going to happen.

3273
04:00:15,000 --> 04:00:19,000
I did that on purpose.

3274
04:00:19,000 --> 04:00:22,000
You guys, you know, you should have done me.

3275
04:00:22,000 --> 04:00:23,000
You didn't know it.

3276
04:00:23,000 --> 04:00:28,000
I can't kill you.

3277
04:00:28,000 --> 04:00:35,000
It was a joke.

3278
04:00:35,000 --> 04:00:40,000
I'm going to get my game license back.

3279
04:00:40,000 --> 04:00:44,000
I'm going to go take my game or test again.

3280
04:00:44,000 --> 04:00:45,000
Hold on a second.

3281
04:00:45,000 --> 04:00:52,000
I'm going to take my game or license test.

3282
04:00:52,000 --> 04:00:58,000
I can't believe you just unlocked the scissors.

3283
04:00:58,000 --> 04:00:59,000
Why did I not have the scissors?

3284
04:00:59,000 --> 04:01:02,000
I have like 75 hours in this game.

3285
04:01:02,000 --> 04:01:07,000
How do I not have the scissors?

3286
04:01:07,000 --> 04:01:08,000
That's f***ing.

3287
04:01:08,000 --> 04:01:13,000
I don't know how that's possible.

3288
04:01:13,000 --> 04:01:16,000
That was a fake run, guys.

3289
04:01:16,000 --> 04:01:23,000
That was even a real run.

3290
04:01:23,000 --> 04:01:35,000
I need to do something to get my game license back.

3291
04:01:35,000 --> 04:01:36,000
Let's see.

3292
04:01:36,000 --> 04:01:37,000
What can I do?

3293
04:01:37,000 --> 04:01:41,000
I can prove to you guys that I can get my game license back.

3294
04:01:41,000 --> 04:01:44,000
After just getting it revoked.

3295
04:01:44,000 --> 04:02:03,000
I just like crashed into a mailbox and they took away my license.

3296
04:02:03,000 --> 04:02:09,000
I don't know.

3297
04:02:09,000 --> 04:02:20,000
Your license has been revoked.

3298
04:02:20,000 --> 04:02:25,000
I just tried to parallel park and I drove over the curb four times.

3299
04:02:25,000 --> 04:02:32,000
I tried to play it off like it didn't happen.

3300
04:02:32,000 --> 04:02:35,000
The guy was doing my driver's head test.

3301
04:02:35,000 --> 04:02:39,000
He kept on going, okay, just straighten it out.

3302
04:02:39,000 --> 04:02:42,000
You know what he's thinking.

3303
04:02:42,000 --> 04:02:45,000
This dude failed the test.

3304
04:02:45,000 --> 04:02:50,000
You go over the curb and it's just like, okay, just took straight.

3305
04:02:50,000 --> 04:02:54,000
And the whole time he's sitting there going, I failed.

3306
04:02:54,000 --> 04:02:57,000
You're getting all worked up about it.

3307
04:02:57,000 --> 04:03:00,000
You straighten it out and you back over the curb again.

3308
04:03:00,000 --> 04:03:07,000
You know, I can put the brake on whatever I want on his passenger side.

3309
04:03:07,000 --> 04:03:10,000
And he makes you get out of the car and he does it for you.

3310
04:03:10,000 --> 04:03:12,000
And he's like, okay, it was all right.

3311
04:03:12,000 --> 04:03:17,000
I hope until that point.

3312
04:03:17,000 --> 04:03:21,000
Let me see.

3313
04:03:21,000 --> 04:03:23,000
Give me a second, guys.

3314
04:03:23,000 --> 04:03:29,000
I think I know just the way to get my game license back.

3315
04:03:30,000 --> 04:03:36,000
Just a second here.

3316
04:03:36,000 --> 04:03:43,000
Just one second here.

3317
04:03:43,000 --> 04:03:46,000
Submit a urine sample to Janet.

3318
04:03:46,000 --> 04:03:50,000
Yeah, I'm going to piss in a jar and you guys could test it, Steve.

3319
04:03:50,000 --> 04:03:54,000
Does that game in plasma in it?

3320
04:03:54,000 --> 04:03:58,000
I think you guys are going to hear this and you're going to know how we're going to get our game license back.

3321
04:03:59,000 --> 04:04:05,000
That's right.

3322
04:04:15,000 --> 04:04:20,000
That's right.

3323
04:04:20,000 --> 04:04:24,000
Super Meat Boy!

3324
04:04:24,000 --> 04:04:27,000
Let's go.

3325
04:04:27,000 --> 04:04:33,000
I just got a beat.

3326
04:04:33,000 --> 04:04:38,000
The first level of Meat Boy.

3327
04:04:38,000 --> 04:04:41,000
In 10 seconds.
