Got it. I can't believe I said I was gonna beat this game

59
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:58,000

61
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:17,000
You needed something to fall asleep to Larry. I'm sorry. This is what you have to fall asleep to

62
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:20,000
It would be tough if I was you

63
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:23,000
Slender and SCP containment breach

64
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:36,000

69
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:14,000
There was no indication that that was gonna happen

70
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:26,000
One down

00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:28,000
It's like only three more games to play oh

00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:33,000
Wow

76
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:54,000
Hmm

79
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:11,000

Honestly like that I did not I really did not think that he was there I

81
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:21,000
Really did not think he was there. How's that look?

82
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:27,000
Now I didn't want to do that. I wanted to go to here. Okay, it looks fine

83
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:31,000

See the bad part about these these like SCP and Slender and stuff if you try to hit escape or get like to a menu or something

87
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:52,000

All right, I gotta get ready for this one

93
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:21,000
Last time I was stupid and I turned around and looked at him and said hello

94
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:32,000
Page one all right, I gotta I gotta think of a plan of action here before I pick this up

00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:40,000
Okay, there's the page one. I'm gonna go straight through here

101
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:07,000
I think I already hear still no idea. Oh great. I think I decided to run into offense now. I'm gonna turn around

102
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:10,000
He's gonna be right there. Cool great

103
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:19,000
I

104
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:28,000
Shouldn't ran that was a dumb idea. I shouldn't have sprinted

105
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:35,000
Well, you know what I wish there was a stamina bar somebody said the stamina is like it's hard to read

106
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:40,000
I wish there was a bar right there like right on the screen that said all you have like this percentage or this amount

107
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:44,000
I just walk into circle

108
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:50,000
Hmm

109
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:56,000
Man, I hate this I hate this guy

110
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:03,000
Where's like the gun so I can turn around just just unload on his and touch that

111
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:06,000
Where's that water

112
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:11,000
I think this water in this game. Oh, is that water or static? There's no water

113
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:17,000
I'm not looking behind me. I'm not I'm not making that same mistake

114
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:22,000
See last time I look behind me that was a massive mistake

115
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:27,000
What do you guys say let's see

116
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:32,000
Straight jump and you can jump in this game. I don't think you can jump

117
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:35,000
I thought that was him right there by the way like whatever the hell that is

118
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:41,000
Oh, we have some moss on the tree. That's painted just like slenderman's body

119
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:48,000
No, I'm not looking behind me. Don't ever look behind you

120
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:51,000
Worst idea

121
00:10:56,000 --> 00:11:01,000
You know what's people to talk about the spy and slenderman think about it. He's in a suit

122
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:09,000
He has like no face. He's got like a mask on what I don't maybe maybe it doesn't have a mask on but tall guy in a suit that gets behind you

123
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:12,000
Slenderman is a spy

124
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:16,000
What I hate being in here get oh

125
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:19,000

129
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:35,000

132
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:48,000

133
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:53,000

00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:06,000
Gonna spit that out I was if he jumped at me right there

137
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:09,000
I would have spit that all of my screen in the stream would have had to like end

138
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:12,000
Getting stuck on trees now. That's not cool

139
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:23,000
Probably right behind me and it's gonna make that noise

140
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:30,000
Oh move faster you piece of

00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:44,000
What's what somebody say? Jeremy is lend him but I don't know I don't even know what that said I'm too scared

143
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:48,000

He's probably this asshole is probably gonna be standing right here

145
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:59,000
I wish I could just take my headphones out not if they hear this music

146
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:03,000
I'm gonna have to turn around

147
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:07,000

00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:08,000
Didn't want to do this damn game more than once

333
00:31:11,000 --> 00:31:13,000
Here we go

334
00:31:13,000 --> 00:31:15,000
It's gonna be like

335
00:31:15,000 --> 00:31:21,000
So hey prepare your ears. I'm one of you guys right now turn your headphones down

336
00:31:21,000 --> 00:31:24,000
Because I gotta catch this if I don't catch it immediately

337
00:31:25,000 --> 00:31:27,000
Then it's gonna be an issue so hold me a minute

338
00:31:29,000 --> 00:31:33,000
Let me make sure the face game's nice and big and to go on it

339
00:31:34,000 --> 00:31:36,000
Here we go

340
00:31:37,000 --> 00:31:39,000
I gotta make sure the mixers here

341
00:31:41,000 --> 00:31:43,000
Wait

342
00:31:43,000 --> 00:31:45,000
Wait, wait, why does it say containment breach is in the background?

343
00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:48,000
Hold on a second hold on a second

344
00:31:50,000 --> 00:31:52,000
One second here

345
00:31:52,000 --> 00:31:55,000
I think the reason why it's screwing up is because

346
00:31:56,000 --> 00:31:58,000
It's like thinks it's running in the background

347
00:31:59,000 --> 00:32:03,000
Oh, whatever. I don't want to waste your guys time anymore. You guys have been patient. Let's do it

348
00:32:04,000 --> 00:32:06,000
You guys have been patient. Let's do it

349
00:32:11,000 --> 00:32:13,000
Here we go

350
00:32:16,000 --> 00:32:22,000
Here we go. I'm just stalling as much as I can here we go. No

351
00:32:23,000 --> 00:32:25,000
Super crate box. That's a great game

352
00:32:31,000 --> 00:32:33,000
Don't want to click this button. I don't want to play this game again

353
00:32:33,000 --> 00:32:38,000
But you know what I'm gonna play it again because you have to man up sometimes and do it. So here we go

354
00:32:41,000 --> 00:32:43,000
All right

355
00:32:52,000 --> 00:32:55,000
Please proceed with caution please I'll give you

356
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:05,000
No, what's this oh smart that game's fun, but if I just like don't look at the screen once

357
00:33:11,000 --> 00:33:14,000
What the see you later. Bye. No

358
00:33:15,000 --> 00:33:20,000
No, no, I don't think so. I don't think so I don't think so

359
00:33:21,000 --> 00:33:23,000
See you

360
00:33:23,000 --> 00:33:25,000
That's not happening

361
00:33:27,000 --> 00:33:31,000
Did you see that it just was like it?

362
00:33:33,000 --> 00:33:36,000
All right fine fine fine fine we'll do it again. We'll do it again

363
00:33:38,000 --> 00:33:40,000
No

364
00:33:41,000 --> 00:33:43,000
I don't want to in there

365
00:33:49,000 --> 00:33:51,000
If you if you missed what what just happened

366
00:33:53,000 --> 00:33:57,000
Something just flashed on the screen like a face just flashed in my face

367
00:33:59,000 --> 00:34:01,000
I looked like the Cheshire cat from house in Wonderland

368
00:34:06,000 --> 00:34:08,000
What happens if I go down here

369
00:34:11,000 --> 00:34:13,000
What

370
00:34:20,000 --> 00:34:22,000
Third times a charm guys

371
00:34:26,000 --> 00:34:28,000
I keep leaving

372
00:34:28,000 --> 00:34:32,000
You gotta be kidding me. Oh, be sure you don't like fall out of the hole and die

373
00:34:32,000 --> 00:34:40,000
Let's go is this is gonna be the real one

374
00:34:42,000 --> 00:34:45,000
I'm not gonna do any dumb mistakes and I'm not gonna leave right off the bat

375
00:34:48,000 --> 00:34:50,000
Yeah, I know

376
00:34:50,000 --> 00:34:54,000
I'm pretty sure I pretty sure I know that that's where I am at this point. You don't have to keep telling me

377
00:34:56,000 --> 00:35:00,000
Well, let me get like the dust off my screen because it's making me think that this stuff on there

378
00:35:03,000 --> 00:35:13,000
You are now entering some gauntlet legends you are now entering the crypt of the spider kingdom or something whatever it was

379
00:35:14,000 --> 00:35:20,000
Just keep talking and I won't be scared just keep talking just keep making noises with your mouth and you won't be scared

380
00:35:20,000 --> 00:35:22,000
Both things that are jumping out of you on the screen

381
00:35:28,000 --> 00:35:30,000
You know what man

382
00:35:32,000 --> 00:35:34,000
I am just so sick of you

383
00:35:36,000 --> 00:35:38,000
Why do you have to keep doing that

384
00:35:46,000 --> 00:35:50,000
What what what what is this what the hell is this why is it what's this?

385
00:35:51,000 --> 00:35:53,000
Stir why

386
00:35:53,000 --> 00:35:55,000
Where am I?

387
00:35:55,000 --> 00:35:57,000
I don't have a flashlight. I don't even know where I am

388
00:35:58,000 --> 00:36:01,000
Do I go in there? Do I go over here? I don't know I don't know I don't know

389
00:36:10,000 --> 00:36:12,000
Do with one eye if I do it with one eye it's not that bad

390
00:36:14,000 --> 00:36:17,000
If I do it with one eye it it still is bad. It's still just as bad with one eye forget that

391
00:36:18,000 --> 00:36:22,000
Never mind what I just said it's still just as bad with one eye closed or about both eyes closed

392
00:36:24,000 --> 00:36:26,000
Did I get to where I'm going?

393
00:36:27,000 --> 00:36:30,000
Things are getting weird looking again things are getting like green and like opaque and

394
00:36:33,000 --> 00:36:35,000
Oh, this is it get me out of here

395
00:36:36,000 --> 00:36:38,000
I think he's on stage

396
00:36:42,000 --> 00:36:44,000
Stop it

397
00:36:46,000 --> 00:36:48,000
Why

398
00:36:48,000 --> 00:36:50,000
This is what happened last time and then the thing jumped out of me

399
00:36:51,000 --> 00:36:53,000
Oh

400
00:36:57,000 --> 00:36:59,000
410

401
00:37:04,000 --> 00:37:08,000
If you I got to think of a song a nice happy song hold on

402
00:37:10,000 --> 00:37:13,000
Rain drops keep falling on my head

403
00:37:14,000 --> 00:37:18,000
But that don't leave my lives a true video there red

404
00:37:19,000 --> 00:37:21,000
But the server bed

405
00:37:21,000 --> 00:37:24,000
Lads of the rain drops keep falling on my head

406
00:37:24,000 --> 00:37:26,000
They keep falling

407
00:37:26,000 --> 00:37:30,000
But you're blue deep inside of the heart is bad

408
00:37:31,000 --> 00:37:35,000
I don't know the lyrics but it's helping lots

409
00:37:36,000 --> 00:37:38,000
It is helping lots when no it's not

410
00:37:44,000 --> 00:37:46,000
No

411
00:37:46,000 --> 00:37:48,000
Just keep

412
00:37:49,000 --> 00:37:55,000
Oh man I hate it bummed down pretty far I didn't get down this far last time

413
00:37:56,000 --> 00:37:59,000
I think it did I don't remember it's just a blur at this point

414
00:38:03,000 --> 00:38:05,000
15 hi

415
00:38:07,000 --> 00:38:13,000
It she knows it she knows it's a it's a it's a way for me to pretend like I haven't that you know so I can like not look at the screen kind of brilliant maybe

416
00:38:14,000 --> 00:38:16,000
Damn it man

417
00:38:19,000 --> 00:38:21,000
I

418
00:38:27,000 --> 00:38:29,000
Am I going down further

419
00:38:32,000 --> 00:38:34,000
I'm not going down further than that

420
00:38:42,000 --> 00:38:44,000
Containment breach

421
00:38:49,000 --> 00:38:53,000
Like that that this game hurts my head

422
00:38:55,000 --> 00:38:57,000
Wow

423
00:39:01,000 --> 00:39:03,000
Oh

424
00:39:04,000 --> 00:39:07,000
Beatbox the Halloween theme but like the d d d d d

425
00:39:07,000 --> 00:39:09,000
All right, I'll do that

426
00:39:09,000 --> 00:39:11,000
I

427
00:39:14,000 --> 00:39:16,000
As I go

428
00:39:17,000 --> 00:39:19,000
Here we go all right

429
00:39:19,000 --> 00:39:21,000
Let's see if I can uh I can do this

430
00:39:23,000 --> 00:39:25,000
Because this Halloween makes sense right

431
00:39:26,000 --> 00:39:28,000
Most of Halloween right now but it will be

432
00:39:34,000 --> 00:39:36,000
Here we go

433
00:39:39,000 --> 00:39:41,000
Do

434
00:39:48,000 --> 00:39:51,000
I can't even do it it's too hard I'll slow it down on

435
00:40:03,000 --> 00:40:05,000
There we go that was better. I was a little bit better

436
00:40:06,000 --> 00:40:09,000
I tried to do it like way too fast the first time like

437
00:40:10,000 --> 00:40:12,000
It wasn't gonna work

438
00:40:13,000 --> 00:40:15,000
All right
