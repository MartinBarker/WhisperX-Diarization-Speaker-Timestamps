6
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:53,000
Steam community body. 15 minutes. Yeah.

7
00:00:53,000 --> 00:01:07,000
Okay, dokey. Almost forgot Twitter. Let's get a server going so people can play while I finish this up.

8
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:17,000
How about a couple of king of the hill badlands? All right. You guys ready to be happy?

9
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:21,000
Oh, one second. Nope. Not even on the thing for it. Hold on. Let me press play.

10
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:27,000
Well, I have to like give the IP to burger boy because he got really mad at me last time. I didn't give it to him.

11
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:37,000
So here we go. Ready? Nope. Oh, you're gonna get you're not gonna make it. I'm gonna

12
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:41,000
both face it. People probably reading it right now going in. Wait, did you already

13
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:47,000
paste it? No. I'm like wasted. It's just sitting on the screen right now. People will be able to

14
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:54,000
get it. There's already people in there. Oh, sorry. That was tweaking.

15
00:01:54,000 --> 00:02:04,000
All right. Ready? I'll be in five seconds. What were you doing? Were you like all like toilet?

16
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:17,000
I was getting off. I'm about to hit this button. I'm about to hit the button. 63.146.

17
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:25,000
Call in 27025. You better hurry up. All right. I wasn't even ready.

18
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:32,000
What were you doing? But join the I'm joining off of you. Oh, you better hurry up, John.

19
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:39,000
Oh, steamy day.

20
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:46,000
We're good. I'm in here. I gotta like I don't even put it on. Yeah, I told you to like go because I could like remember the number.

21
00:02:46,000 --> 00:03:04,000
I can remember that 12 digit number. No, HL2 dot EXE troll. What's gonna happen there? It's not real. It is real. It's always real.

22
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:11,000
Now when it's loading the game. Have I seen the hung I've not seen the hunger games? Is it any good?

23
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:18,000
And if the answer is yes, I will probably see it. It's about as good as the TV show community.

24
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:27,000
It's good as it gets. That was a good movie with Jack Nicholson. Oh, there's Berkaboy the insensitive one.

25
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:35,000
The insensitive one. Berkaboy the insensitive one.

26
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:43,000
There he is. Because we all know that he's a real insensitive bastard. You've seen it five times.

27
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:50,000
Oh, it's gonna be bad. You didn't think different happened that fifth time? Ouch. Different, I think.

28
00:03:50,000 --> 00:04:02,000
Oh, there's a big Twitter. Where's my like hold on? I gotta like say it to my Twitter followers.

29
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:05,000
No, hold on. Just tick.

30
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:13,000
Oh, yeah. I just take it. Oh, it's those of you wondering. I'll bring up my back back so you can look at it.

31
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:15,000
Oh, Berkaboy. The insensitive one.

32
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:20,000
There's this page one. So you can go over page one while I do Twitter and then I'll do page two in a second.

33
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:30,000
I go backstabbed. Don't get backstabbed.

34
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:39,000
Alrighty. All right, we go to page two. Page two. That's the page two.

35
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:43,000
Even though you can't see. Oh, wait, show up. Oh, yeah. Sorry. Sorry.

36
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:48,000
So look at back to page one so you can see the colors. This whole thing's been given away.

37
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:51,000
So hopefully you're one of the winners.

38
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:12,000
Oh, no, page two. I got a lot of strangers. A lot of strangers.

39
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:29,000
Page three. That you hit your head. Yeah.

40
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:38,000
Page four.

41
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:41,000
I love how Berkaboy is using the vlogger now.

42
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:46,000
Hey, you're going to have to deal with it now, aren't you? No, I do know. He's on my arty.

43
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:50,000
I'm like, medic in hand.

44
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:55,000
One more page after this.

45
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:58,000
Does the needed one stick you to the wall?

46
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:00,000
I don't think it does. It ain't only the.

47
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:05,000
My character was like standing up. I tried to kill him. And then page six.

48
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:12,000
This is probably like the best page with all my actual hats that I like love.

49
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:23,000
And all the strangers are of course over here. You get the idea.

50
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:30,000
Let's do it. Let's do a high five and let's get this wrong.

51
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:37,000
Yeah, items that I cannot give away. I'm not. I won't be able to give away.

52
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:41,000
So I can't give away the cheaters lament. I can't give away.

53
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:45,000
I think there's a couple other things you can't give either.

54
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:52,000
There's like two or three items. I know for sure I can't not give.

55
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:57,000
Alvegim Julu. Let's turn it back.

56
00:06:57,000 --> 00:07:04,000
Just a tick. Just a tick.

57
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:09,000
Where's my gerotti? I don't have the gerotti.

58
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:17,000
Oh, schmack. Oh dear, not again.

59
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:21,000
Oh, watch it, watch it, watch it, watch it.

60
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:26,000
On this corner here. Many century. Get out of here.

61
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:29,000
Oh, how did I not get him? Get him.

62
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:34,000
You as buy you kind of act in like one.

63
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:40,000
Look, MLC stealth just killed stealth.

64
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:45,000
It's fun. When do I think I'll hit 25,000?

65
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:49,000
Probably a couple weeks maybe. Maybe a week. I don't know.

66
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:53,000
It's going to happen sooner rather than later. I probably will say that.

67
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:57,000
I don't know though.

68
00:07:57,000 --> 00:08:04,000
I have no idea.

69
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:08,000
Follow me, Jack.

70
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:11,000
Oh, you ran into it.

71
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:16,000
I was pretty nice.

72
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:20,000
I don't say so myself.

73
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:24,000
I just got like fished. I got fish killed.

74
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:29,000
I'm streaming this to the Boo Man 61 and MLC stealth.

75
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:32,000
Boo and stealth. Hello. Hello.

76
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:37,000
Those are your wonder.

77
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:40,000
I was kicked by console. That's not cool.

78
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:43,000
You got kicks? No, no, no, no, someone's saying they were kicked.

79
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:46,000
What would you do? Nothing proper.

80
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:49,000
That's a bunch of B. It's changing level.

81
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:51,000
It felt like you were talking to your dog.

82
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:54,000
What did you do? What did you do, auto?

83
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:59,000
I'm not.

84
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:05,000
Nukuleus, huh? Nukuleus. Nukuleus.

85
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:08,000
Direct it. I'll try it.

86
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:13,000
I'm not.

87
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:16,000
Why am I using that?

88
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:20,000
It's CH.

89
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:23,000
It's like church.

90
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:26,000
Do you know how to pronounce things?

91
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:31,000
Sniper's I'm scared.

92
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:35,000
Oh, do you remember yesterday I was saying about how hard it is to headshot soldiers?

93
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:38,000
I'm scared, Gemma.

94
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:41,000
Boo, why are you no post-motto warfare 3?

95
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:44,000
That's what I said.

96
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:48,000
I might not be totally dumb, but I'm weighing it up in my head.

97
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:52,000
Some old recorded gameplay I just never used.

98
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:56,000
I might make a few more of those out of it.

99
00:09:56,000 --> 00:10:01,000
This is a fire roll.

100
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:04,000
Direct hit.

101
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:09,000
Watch out for the crits.

102
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:16,000
Oh, people everywhere.

103
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:21,000
No, no soldier.

104
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:23,000
I'm going to go.

105
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:26,000
I'm going to go fire roll with this setup.

106
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:30,000
Because I like it.

107
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:36,000
Hold on.

108
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:41,000
Hold on.

109
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:44,000
Let's go.

110
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:48,000
No, I missed it.

111
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:53,000
I missed it.

112
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:59,000
No.

113
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:04,000
I'm going to turn the volume up a little bit.

114
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:08,000
Can you guys hear the in-game volume?

115
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:11,000
Okay, where's the 2 low?

116
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:14,000
Let me know.

117
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:17,000
Oh no, I hit.

118
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:20,000
We have to play.

119
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:25,000
I got to start playing.

120
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:28,000
Oh no, I missed.

121
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:34,000
Get him off the point.

122
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:39,000
Oh no, the only one on here.

123
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:42,000
I'm screwed.

124
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:47,000
We're going to get it.

125
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:49,000
I'll hit or joke.

126
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:52,000
Tell me a joke.

127
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:55,000
Give me all you got with the jokes.

128
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:57,000
I love jokes.

129
00:11:57,000 --> 00:12:00,000
No, I missed time badly.

130
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:08,000
Oh, you son of a bitch.

131
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:11,000
You rad bastard.

132
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:17,000
Wait, it's probably tight.

133
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:20,000
It's probably tight.

134
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:23,000
Oh no, I just missed.

135
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:26,000
I can step my game up a little bit here.

136
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:32,000
I'm going to get a bit of a dead.

137
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:36,000
I don't know why I could have survived that.

138
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:45,000
I can't be fired right now.

139
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:48,000
That was a lucky edge.

140
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:51,000
I'm going demo.

141
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:55,000
I'm going demo.

142
00:12:55,000 --> 00:13:01,000
What makes you a good demo man?

143
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:04,000
A lot of things.

144
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:07,000
If you are good with shooting your pills.

145
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:13,000
I can drink from a frying pan.

146
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:18,000
What makes me a good demo man?

147
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:20,000
Oh, he just lost.

148
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:24,000
Well, I will raise a demo.

149
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:27,000
I want to be your discottenant with you now.

150
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:33,000
What are you?

151
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:36,000
No.

152
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:39,000
We need more than one medic.

153
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:42,000
You have two medic, sir.

154
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:45,000
I had shot at one of them.

155
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:48,000
I just walked right off the map.

156
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:51,000
Hey, there's a big hole in the middle of this map.

157
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:54,000
I'm still.

158
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:57,000
Your mom is so fat.

159
00:13:57,000 --> 00:14:00,000
Everyone at the movie did it.

160
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:03,000
I can't really have burgdebois coming for me.

161
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:08,000
Your mom is so fat at the movie did it.

162
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:12,000
She sat next to everyone.

163
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:15,000
Sick.

164
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:18,000
I got one for you.

165
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:21,000
She made me cookies and was a wicked nice woman.

166
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:24,000
It was awesome to be around it all times.

167
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:27,000
There you go.

168
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:30,000
Oh, damn.

169
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:33,000
All right, I got one too.

170
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:39,000
Why did the king and queen get a divorce?

171
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:42,000
No. Why?

172
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:47,000
Because they had a bad night.

173
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:50,000
Yeah, you suck.

174
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:53,000
All right, boo, you got to do one now.

175
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:56,000
I've got to do a joke.

176
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:58,000
That's not working.

177
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:01,000
You'll have to give me a few minutes, son.

178
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:04,000
Oh, come on.

179
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:06,000
You have to make it your own.

180
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:08,000
No, the press is on now.

181
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:11,000
I've got a deliver.

182
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:14,000
Hey, joke.

183
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:17,000
Oh, my god.

184
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:20,000
No, I don't want that.

185
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:24,000
No.

186
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:28,000
Get on the foot.

187
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:30,000
I can't.

188
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:32,000
I can't pick my head over there.

189
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:35,000
I'm just trying to log stuff in the air.

190
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:40,000
No, no, no.

191
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:43,000
So, boo, how about that joke?

192
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:52,000
I'm trying to stop looking over my enemy element.

193
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:58,000
Sniper was walking down and everyone hid.

194
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:01,000
Was he snoozing?

195
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:04,000
He was singing that song.

196
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:09,000
He smashed into it.

197
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:13,000
I just got the like event for Germans and humane cycle path.

198
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:15,000
Oh really? It's just started.

199
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:19,000
Yes, that was happens like much later than it should.

200
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:21,000
Yeah, I sometimes said it to do that.

201
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:25,000
Because when I usually when I'm when I first put the announcement out,

202
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:28,000
I'm just kind of sitting there doing like nothing and shouting things out.

203
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:29,000
So people probably just like, what the hell is he doing?

204
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:33,000
So 15 minutes in is pretty much when everything really gets going.

205
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:36,000
I guess your string get priority as well.

206
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:38,000
Till the for the game, which is fair enough.

207
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:48,000
Let's do one more round in here and then we're going to go to different place.

208
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:50,000
What do I play as?

209
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:52,000
That's the question.

210
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:53,000
I'll go scout I guess.

211
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:55,000
Schmack.

212
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:56,000
What king?

213
00:16:57,000 --> 00:17:00,000
I literally just tried holding down shift to sprint.

214
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:03,000
Yeah, I've been doing that since I've been playing battle.

215
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:07,000
Oh, look at how did you ox.

216
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:10,000
Oh, did I save your life just barely anything?

217
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:14,000
Who just wait, okay, I'm so confused right now.

218
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:17,000
I just still have stealth dying in front of me by MLC stealth.

219
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:20,000
That's by behind me, but I don't care. I'm too fast for them.

220
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:23,000
Hey, who's the real one?

221
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:28,000
Oh my god, I can't hit the soldier.

222
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:28,000
I'm so scared.

223
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:29,000
So there we go.

224
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:31,000
Oh my god, thank you for saving my life.

225
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:37,000
Can I play sacks and hail?

226
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:39,000
I we tried doing that a while ago.

227
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:41,000
It didn't really work out so well though.

228
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:44,000
Because we did prop hunt.

229
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:48,000
Well, only because it's I was the only person that could get into the server and we were just

230
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:53,000
spending a whole lot of time just watching, spectating and it was just kind of boring.

231
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:56,000
So at least for a stream, it was kind of boring.

232
00:17:57,000 --> 00:18:01,000
I'd want to do that for like a video, get a bunch of people in there and make some like fun video

233
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:02,000
and I'm going to die.

234
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:06,000
Get me out of here.

235
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:10,000
There are ways of any people there to be fighting right now.

236
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:11,000
Oh my god, they're all chasing me.

237
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:16,000
Oh, come on.

238
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:20,000
You see his body?

239
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:25,000
He's still alive.

240
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:29,000
That other stealth guy is being as like 360.

241
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:31,000
I have two health.

242
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:34,000
Except for the sea and for me, might as well just do this.

243
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:38,000
Oh my god, oh my god.

244
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:40,000
I got killed by a fish.

245
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:41,000
I was you.

246
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:46,000
Oh, I'm just trying to be sort of a bitch.

247
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:53,000
I was in the spawn door and he shot me right in the back.

248
00:18:54,000 --> 00:19:02,000
Like I was like I was right like in the door and I got hit right in the back.

249
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:06,000
Yeah, I'm right on the red team.

250
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:07,000
It was a revolver too.

251
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:10,000
He's not dead.

252
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:12,000
We got a lot of scout.

253
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:13,000
I just heard him.

254
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:14,000
I just heard him.

255
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:18,000
Was this soldier behind this bastard?

256
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:21,000
I feel like Plank of Pyro.

257
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:23,000
You've starting to like him more now.

258
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:25,000
I was never good at Pyro before.

259
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:26,000
Oh, I'm scared.

260
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:27,000
I'm going to go around the screen.

261
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:30,000
I've learned to really like Plank Pyro.

262
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:33,000
Plank Pyro is like a ton of fun for me.

263
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:38,000
And I never used to like him because I always wanted to use the flag.

264
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:41,000
And when I found another Pyro, it's impossible.

265
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:44,000
Go, go, go, go.

266
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:48,000
Yeah, the flag on pretty much reinvented Pyro for me.

267
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:51,000
Like it became so much fun.

268
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:56,000
What are my views on meet the Pyro?

269
00:19:57,000 --> 00:19:59,000
I think it's going to be epic.

270
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:03,000
Judging by the last two we've gotten meet the medic and meet the spy,

271
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:04,000
they've been unbelievable.

272
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:11,000
So one can only hope it's got to be something just as good if not better than meet the spy and meet the medic.

273
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:15,000
What if it was like a 2D animation thing?

274
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:20,000
Yeah, that'd be interesting.

275
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:23,000
It'd be interesting, it'd be cool.

276
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:26,000
No, no, no, like it's sucks.

277
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:30,000
And what if meet the Pyro sucked?

278
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:32,000
I would be disappointed.

279
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:33,000
I shouldn't have shot him.

280
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:33,000
Why don't you do that?

281
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:35,000
At least you got my back anyways.

282
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:37,000
I'm getting destroyed.

283
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:39,000
As you meet the Pyro was like stick fingers.

284
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:42,000
And like the music was a midi file.

285
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:45,000
Like, oh god.

286
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:48,000
What if the Pyro was a stick figure?

287
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:51,000
Well, you just blew my mind right there.

288
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:52,000
What?

289
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:55,000
You just totally blew it.

290
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:58,000
Like he takes off his mask and it's literally just a stick figure.

291
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:02,000
It's like a broom, like a family guy.

292
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:10,000
Oh no!

293
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:10,000
Oh no!

294
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:15,000
They're probably not going to take his mask off.

295
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:17,000
I bet you hit the hill, take his mask off.

296
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:18,000
You're saying mask.

297
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:18,000
You're saying mask.

298
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:20,000
Why is saying, well, him or her.

299
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:26,000
The Pyro would probably take off the mask right when the ending happens.

300
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:27,000
Like, oh, here I go, like here it.

301
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:30,000
Duh, duh, duh, duh, duh, duh, duh, duh, it'll probably be something like that.

302
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:32,000
What if it would be Gabe Newell's troll face?

303
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:35,000
What if it was a game, it would be Gabe Newell's face?

304
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:36,000
It's just Gabe Newell's face?

305
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:38,000
Here's him.

306
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:41,000
Like he made the character like after himself.

307
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:44,000
I cannot hit the scout to save my life.

308
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:48,000
Yeah, then anybody can save my life.

309
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:49,000
He's a real, he's.

310
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:51,000
Oh.

311
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:54,000
I mean, all jokes aside, the Pyro is clearly going to be Zoe.

312
00:21:57,000 --> 00:21:59,000
Clearly, let's take the scout and then if I'm going to go with the...

313
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:02,000
I'm going to show it stop.

314
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:03,000
Do I have a stranger?

315
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:04,000
I don't.

316
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:06,000
We'll go with the whole set.

317
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:09,000
How do you stop a Gabe Ben?

318
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:12,000
Easy, you press the Gabe Ben.

319
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:13,000
Gabe Ben, Gabe Ben.

320
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:18,000
In addition, I'll save you.

321
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:21,000
Oh god.

322
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:28,000
Help me.

323
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:32,000
Oh, boo with the pistol.

324
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:33,000
Nice.

325
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:40,000
Okay, if somebody can find an empty randomizer server,

326
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:43,000
we need an empty randomizer server.

327
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:46,000
Not a full one, not one that's like in a arena.

328
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:50,000
A real good, like instant respawn randomizer server with nobody in it.

329
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:52,000
Then we can hop into it.

330
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:57,000
No, I'm not dealing with that.

331
00:22:58,000 --> 00:23:03,000
This guy, the Lodinorbs, has been destroying me all game.

332
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:12,000
So that is a quest for the Jerma group to find that randomizer server?

333
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:13,000
I think you got the community.

334
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:16,000
How many Jerma points do they get for completing that quest?

335
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:19,000
I just say 15 Jerma points.

336
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:23,000
I know that's you.

337
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:24,000
Nothing.

338
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:26,000
Small one, you got Optimus Prime with you.

339
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:26,000
No.

340
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:30,000
Oh, come on now.

341
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:32,000
He's going to headshot me.

342
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:33,000
I know he is.

343
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:34,000
He always does.

344
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:50,000
Can I like vote Optimus Prime like Best Spy in the world?

345
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:53,000
Like Best Spy in team Fortress?

346
00:23:53,000 --> 00:23:55,000
Can I like safely say that right now?

347
00:23:55,000 --> 00:23:58,000
I like really the guy.

348
00:23:58,000 --> 00:24:02,000
He's in part of that with like electric Buggalo.

349
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:05,000
Bungalo get electric, XSB inage.

350
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:16,000
Oh my god, why am I not hitting anybody with this?

351
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:21,000
Let's get in here and then do it.

352
00:24:23,000 --> 00:24:24,000
That was so lucky stuff.

353
00:24:25,000 --> 00:24:26,000
I'm going to die.

354
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:27,000
Oh, boy.

355
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:29,000
This is a brass piece.

356
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:30,000
What are you doing?

357
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:30,000
I don't know.

358
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:31,000
Oh, did I get it?

359
00:24:31,000 --> 00:24:32,000
I was so lucky.

360
00:24:33,000 --> 00:24:33,000
I did not get it.

361
00:24:33,000 --> 00:24:34,000
I'm sorry.

362
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:34,000
I'm sorry.

363
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:39,000
No, I'll get on that.

364
00:24:39,000 --> 00:24:39,000
Get on it.

365
00:24:39,000 --> 00:24:40,000
Somebody get on it.

366
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:42,000
Somebody just sneeze on it.

367
00:24:45,000 --> 00:24:46,000
No, no.

368
00:24:47,000 --> 00:24:48,000
I refuse to die.

369
00:24:49,000 --> 00:24:50,000
I refuse.

370
00:24:53,000 --> 00:24:54,000
Jump it.

371
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:55,000
Jump the pit quick.

372
00:24:57,000 --> 00:24:57,000
All right.

373
00:24:57,000 --> 00:25:00,000
So that is a, we got to randomize server right there.

374
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:00,000
It empty.

375
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:03,000
If that is the case.

376
00:25:03,000 --> 00:25:04,000
It was so close.

377
00:25:05,000 --> 00:25:06,000
Let's go find out.

378
00:25:09,000 --> 00:25:10,000
I need to go to

379
00:25:11,000 --> 00:25:12,000
the chief server.

380
00:25:15,000 --> 00:25:16,000
Add a server.

381
00:25:17,000 --> 00:25:19,000
Let's see if this one has like no people in it.

382
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:22,000
All right.

383
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:23,000
So here we go.

384
00:25:25,000 --> 00:25:27,000
This is the server that we're going into right now.

385
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:29,000
You ready guys?

386
00:25:29,000 --> 00:25:30,000
Yes.

387
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:31,000
207.

388
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:34,000
Dot 188.

389
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:36,000
Dot 214.

390
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:36,000
Dot 12.

391
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:38,000
Colin 28.

392
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:39,000
016.

393
00:25:39,000 --> 00:25:41,000
Go, go, go, go, go.

394
00:25:41,000 --> 00:25:42,000
Attempting 15.

395
00:25:43,000 --> 00:25:44,000
Idiot.

396
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:44,000
Shut the air.

397
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:45,000
I assume.

398
00:25:49,000 --> 00:25:52,000
So randomizes like heathies with spy knives.

399
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:54,000
Yeah, this is like this is like total nonsensical.

400
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:56,000
It's on nucleus too.

401
00:25:56,000 --> 00:25:57,000
What?

402
00:25:57,000 --> 00:25:57,000
Oh man.

403
00:25:58,000 --> 00:25:59,000
There you go.

404
00:25:59,000 --> 00:26:00,000
Drop to the slot reservation.

405
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:00,000
What?

406
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:04,000
Okay.

407
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:07,000
I need to slot reservation.

408
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:09,000
Well,

409
00:26:11,000 --> 00:26:15,000
well, my first one was a medic with the Machina Girati

410
00:26:15,000 --> 00:26:17,000
and disciplinary action.

411
00:26:17,000 --> 00:26:18,000
I should have got in there first before I sent it.

412
00:26:19,000 --> 00:26:20,000
No, damn it.

413
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:21,000
All right.

414
00:26:21,000 --> 00:26:22,000
What was the second one?

415
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:23,000
I don't even make it up.

416
00:26:23,000 --> 00:26:24,000
I gotta get in there first.

417
00:26:25,000 --> 00:26:27,000
Let's see if this one was existing.

418
00:26:27,000 --> 00:26:28,000
We're gonna have to change.

419
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:29,000
This is no way I'll get in there now.

420
00:26:31,000 --> 00:26:32,000
Got a server.

421
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:33,000
Let's try it again.

422
00:26:33,000 --> 00:26:33,000
This one.

423
00:26:35,000 --> 00:26:35,000
Okay.

424
00:26:35,000 --> 00:26:36,000
There we go.

425
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:36,000
All right.

426
00:26:37,000 --> 00:26:40,000
So I'm gonna put a new IP into the chat.

427
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:44,000
So when you get a chance,

428
00:26:45,000 --> 00:26:48,000
everybody go to this server and I'm gonna tell you guys ready.

429
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:49,000
205.

430
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:51,000
Dot 234.

431
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:55,000
Dot 152.85.

432
00:26:56,000 --> 00:26:58,000
Call in 27015.

433
00:26:58,000 --> 00:26:59,000
Head in there now.

434
00:26:59,000 --> 00:27:00,000
Let me know when you're connecting.

435
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:04,000
And there we go.

436
00:27:05,000 --> 00:27:06,000
That's the one we're playing on right now.

437
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:08,000
The other one filled up too quickly and has a lot of slot reservations.

438
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:10,000
All right.

439
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:11,000
There we go.

440
00:27:13,000 --> 00:27:14,000
Thank you, Ari.

441
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:17,000
Or Zeus, whoever it is.

442
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:20,000
And it doesn't really matter whatever you pick.

443
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:21,000
What?

444
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:25,000
Okay. This is like the oddest thing ever.

445
00:27:25,000 --> 00:27:25,000
I'm holding the...

446
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:27,000
Am I the heavy?

447
00:27:27,000 --> 00:27:28,000
Or on the sniper?

448
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:31,000
What in God's name?

449
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:34,000
I'm holding the enforcer.

450
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:35,000
It's totally broken apart.

451
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:37,000
And I just...

452
00:27:37,000 --> 00:27:39,000
I can't even actually have to see this.

453
00:27:39,000 --> 00:27:40,000
I can't even explain it.

454
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:41,000
Oh, I got the Ficky Chipper.

455
00:27:41,000 --> 00:27:41,000
I've never had it.

456
00:27:41,000 --> 00:27:42,000
I wasn't having it.

457
00:27:43,000 --> 00:27:44,000
Oh, nice.

458
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:45,000
The golden wrench.

459
00:27:47,000 --> 00:27:48,000
Oh, my God.

460
00:27:49,000 --> 00:27:50,000
Shhh.

461
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:52,000
The hand models are sometimes they're fine.

462
00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:56,000
Sometimes they're just totally broken because I'm a soldier and I have medic gloves with my syringe gun.

463
00:27:58,000 --> 00:28:01,000
Then I pull a weird looking winger and he has normal hands.

464
00:28:01,000 --> 00:28:03,000
Dude, I'm holding this wrench like a gun.

465
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:05,000
And it's like...

466
00:28:05,000 --> 00:28:06,000
I'm not even touching it.

467
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:07,000
It's like floating in my hands.

468
00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:09,000
Who has the century?

469
00:28:11,000 --> 00:28:13,000
This guy's spying with a degreaser.

470
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:18,000
I was floating around like a clown.

471
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:20,000
That is an oxymoron right there.

472
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:21,000
A spy with a flamethrower.

473
00:28:23,000 --> 00:28:25,000
Oh, oh yeah, like the trial was found missing.

474
00:28:25,000 --> 00:28:28,000
This guy's just standing there like, hello.

475
00:28:31,000 --> 00:28:32,000
What the hell is this?

476
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:34,000
Is this the force of nature?

477
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:39,000
I can't even do it.

478
00:28:39,000 --> 00:28:40,000
I can't even taught.

479
00:28:41,000 --> 00:28:44,000
All right, the force of nature, the pistol,

480
00:28:45,000 --> 00:28:47,000
and the Clydean War.

481
00:28:47,000 --> 00:28:48,000
Crits?

482
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:51,000
God, I can't even play my penhurtz by looking at this.

483
00:28:52,000 --> 00:28:54,000
This is a thing to gougly as thick.

484
00:28:59,000 --> 00:29:00,000
Is that guy still standing there?

485
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:01,000
Oh, I gotta see.

486
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:03,000
What?

487
00:29:05,000 --> 00:29:06,000
I'm so confused.

488
00:29:11,000 --> 00:29:12,000
Oh, look at this.

489
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:14,000
It's like a sniper with a liberty launcher, the chocolate.

490
00:29:15,000 --> 00:29:17,000
And the fan of war.

491
00:29:17,000 --> 00:29:18,000
All right, liberty launcher sniper.

492
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:19,000
This could be interesting.

493
00:29:21,000 --> 00:29:21,000
And I zoom in.

494
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:23,000
Every funny could go.

495
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:31,000
Hold on, this guy has a,

496
00:29:31,000 --> 00:29:34,000
that guy just had the Natasha as a sniper.

497
00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:36,000
And he was holding it like a sniper rifle shooting it.

498
00:29:38,000 --> 00:29:39,000
Oh my gosh.

499
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:42,000
I'm using the overdose and if you like,

500
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:44,000
reload and shoot at the same time,

501
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:46,000
you can just keep shooting forever.

502
00:29:46,000 --> 00:29:49,000
I was like, I'm like, I'm just gonna reload it.

503
00:29:51,000 --> 00:29:51,000
All right.

504
00:29:53,000 --> 00:29:55,000
Oh, wait, no, it doesn't actually shoot.

505
00:29:55,000 --> 00:29:58,000
Look at this like pump action, like freak out gun on music.

506
00:29:59,000 --> 00:30:00,000
What else do I have?

507
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:01,000
Oh, the pistol, that's boring.

508
00:30:01,000 --> 00:30:02,000
And what?

509
00:30:03,000 --> 00:30:04,000
What the hell is this?

510
00:30:05,000 --> 00:30:07,000
What the hell is this?

511
00:30:07,000 --> 00:30:08,000
Why am I like a monster?

512
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:09,000
There.

513
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:11,000
What?

514
00:30:11,000 --> 00:30:12,000
I wish you could have just seen that.

515
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:16,000
I had huge like brown monster hands.

516
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:19,000
As it was the engineer.

517
00:30:20,000 --> 00:30:20,000
Who are you playing?

518
00:30:20,000 --> 00:30:21,000
What are you doing?

519
00:30:21,000 --> 00:30:23,000
I'm a spy with the old pool cable.

520
00:30:25,000 --> 00:30:26,000
I was like Sasquatch right there.

521
00:30:29,000 --> 00:30:32,000
A POCO fist is that like a fake thing?

522
00:30:33,000 --> 00:30:36,000
Say, wait, the soldier, soldier spy, turn on.

523
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:38,000
But when I say soldier spy, I mean like soldier

524
00:30:38,000 --> 00:30:38,000
with a knife.

525
00:30:41,000 --> 00:30:42,000
Soldier spy.

526
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:48,000
So they've added new crazy funny items, huh?

527
00:30:51,000 --> 00:30:55,000
All right, engineer with the, oh, the credit cola and the, oh, this is gonna be good.

528
00:30:57,000 --> 00:30:58,000
Oh, that's awesome.

529
00:30:58,000 --> 00:30:59,000
I hope I can stay alive.

530
00:30:59,000 --> 00:31:01,000
Cause this is a great setup.

531
00:31:01,000 --> 00:31:03,000
Is the soldier with the credit cola?

532
00:31:03,000 --> 00:31:04,000
Soldier with rocket launcher?

533
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:05,000
Oh my.

534
00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:07,000
Rocket launcher credit cola.

535
00:31:07,000 --> 00:31:09,000
Like are you are you shooting me?

536
00:31:09,000 --> 00:31:11,000
Oh no, come on.

537
00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:13,000
I didn't even get to use this.

538
00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:15,000
Are you come on?

539
00:31:15,000 --> 00:31:15,000
What?

540
00:31:17,000 --> 00:31:20,000
I didn't even get to use that awesome setup I just had.

541
00:31:21,000 --> 00:31:22,000
That pains me.

542
00:31:23,000 --> 00:31:26,000
Is there by not a, does it not have like King of the Hill?

543
00:31:26,000 --> 00:31:27,000
Cause this would be great for King of the Hill.

544
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:29,000
I don't think so.

545
00:31:31,000 --> 00:31:31,000
All right, Ubersah.

546
00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:34,000
Frontier justice and drive.

547
00:31:34,000 --> 00:31:35,000
This is fantastic.

548
00:31:37,000 --> 00:31:38,000
That has a Medigan.

549
00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:39,000
That's a pyro.

550
00:31:39,000 --> 00:31:41,000
I'm a medic Tommy Slav.

551
00:31:41,000 --> 00:31:42,000
It looks so like out of place.

552
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:43,000
Oh, okay.

553
00:31:45,000 --> 00:31:46,000
Did I kill him?

554
00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:46,000
I got it.

555
00:31:47,000 --> 00:31:52,000
So the apoco fists are the regular fists, but they give people when you crit them.

556
00:31:52,000 --> 00:31:53,000
I don't think I was hurting anyone.

557
00:31:53,000 --> 00:31:55,000
I was shooting them and it wasn't doing damage.

558
00:31:56,000 --> 00:31:58,000
Numbers weren't popping up above their head.

559
00:31:58,000 --> 00:32:00,000
God, this, this like makes me so happy.

560
00:32:01,000 --> 00:32:04,000
Like this moment doesn't, doesn't it just make you like so happy?

561
00:32:07,000 --> 00:32:08,000
Look at this.

562
00:32:09,000 --> 00:32:12,000
This guy's like wearing, wearing the intelligence like Mary Poppins.

563
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:14,000
Like what the hell are you doing?

564
00:32:14,000 --> 00:32:15,000
He's bouncing it on his head.

565
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:22,000
All right, syringe gun and the wrench again.

566
00:32:22,000 --> 00:32:25,000
Can I build, you can't build buildings if you got, well, this is the blue saga.

567
00:32:25,000 --> 00:32:27,000
I'm, I'm dying right now.

568
00:32:27,000 --> 00:32:28,000
Are you serious?

569
00:32:28,000 --> 00:32:29,000
No.

570
00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:33,000
I'm literally dying right now because I'm have blue, it's gonna kill me.

571
00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:36,000
I can't help.

572
00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:40,000
So the blue saga was literally killing.

573
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:42,000
Oh, that was ball.

574
00:32:44,000 --> 00:32:46,000
Okay, I need, I need you to tell me what I have.

575
00:32:47,000 --> 00:32:47,000
All right, where are I?

576
00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:49,000
I'm standing outside this boring door.

577
00:32:49,000 --> 00:32:51,000
I just, I have no idea what this is.

578
00:32:51,000 --> 00:32:54,000
All right, you have the direct hit, the crit's Creeg and...

579
00:32:55,000 --> 00:32:56,000
Oh, the crit's Creeg.

580
00:32:56,000 --> 00:32:56,000
Yeah, you have the crit's Creeg.

581
00:32:56,000 --> 00:32:58,000
It should seem that this looks like for my point of view.

582
00:32:58,000 --> 00:32:59,000
This is retarded.

583
00:32:59,000 --> 00:33:01,000
I just saw like two seconds.

584
00:33:02,000 --> 00:33:05,000
All right, I got the, this, I don't even have the secondary.

585
00:33:06,000 --> 00:33:07,000
I can't, I don't have the secondary.

586
00:33:07,000 --> 00:33:08,000
I can't, I can't, I can't, I can't, I can't, I can't.

587
00:33:08,000 --> 00:33:09,000
It's probably the Razer back.

588
00:33:10,000 --> 00:33:12,000
So Razer back, fists of steel.

589
00:33:12,000 --> 00:33:13,000
Wait, what's fish cake?

590
00:33:14,000 --> 00:33:16,000
It's like a reeskin of a chocolate.

591
00:33:21,000 --> 00:33:24,000
God, this is so, why is this looks so perfect with the sniper?

592
00:33:26,000 --> 00:33:28,000
Oh, come, we just got crits too.

593
00:33:28,000 --> 00:33:30,000
I can't, we got crits.

594
00:33:33,000 --> 00:33:34,000
I have a spy knife.

595
00:33:35,000 --> 00:33:36,000
Read the top of the screen.

596
00:33:38,000 --> 00:33:39,000
What's at the top of the screen?

597
00:33:42,000 --> 00:33:45,000
Oh, oh, oh, God, I am so stupid.

598
00:33:46,000 --> 00:33:50,000
Wow, wow, wow, you, wow, look at how stupid I am.

599
00:33:50,000 --> 00:33:53,000
It says what you have right there.

600
00:33:55,000 --> 00:33:58,000
All right, that was a, like, right when you spawn, it tells you where you have.

601
00:33:58,000 --> 00:33:59,000
Oh, my God.

602
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:03,000
This is not, I'm using like a regular Hydro set right now.

603
00:34:05,000 --> 00:34:07,000
I literally have the, like, a normal, I have to,

604
00:34:09,000 --> 00:34:09,000
whatever.

605
00:34:12,000 --> 00:34:13,000
What, what are I for a melee?

606
00:34:13,000 --> 00:34:14,000
It's golden wrench.

607
00:34:17,000 --> 00:34:21,000
I'm a dimmer man with the enforcer and the guns like broken apart and floating.

608
00:34:21,000 --> 00:34:22,000
Oh, I got it, I got a golden wrench, somebody.

609
00:34:22,000 --> 00:34:25,000
I don't even know, I'm trying to reflect Brock, because I don't even know what he has.

610
00:34:27,000 --> 00:34:28,000
The golden wrench.

611
00:34:30,000 --> 00:34:32,000
This, they turn to a gold statue, don't they?

612
00:34:32,000 --> 00:34:32,000
Yeah, they do.

613
00:34:33,000 --> 00:34:34,000
I've never seen that before.

614
00:34:38,000 --> 00:34:42,000
Yeah, everyone's like, he's like, he's a different class and I'll stand again in the same spot.

615
00:34:44,000 --> 00:34:45,000
Oh, this person's awesome.

616
00:34:49,000 --> 00:34:51,000
What do they keep like capturing the flag so quickly?

617
00:34:51,000 --> 00:34:52,000
That's like, kill.

618
00:34:53,000 --> 00:34:54,000
Kritsana.

619
00:34:55,000 --> 00:34:57,000
Oh, that's too funny.

620
00:34:58,000 --> 00:35:01,000
God, I don't, I don't know, I don't think, I could play this mode.

621
00:35:02,000 --> 00:35:05,000
A thousand times and I probably left just as hard every single time.

622
00:35:07,000 --> 00:35:14,000
It's just how this medic is holding this enforcer like a, like a gang member like sideways.

623
00:35:14,000 --> 00:35:17,000
I wanted, I wanted to see just how I picked that up. Look at this.

624
00:35:19,000 --> 00:35:22,000
Like, oh, yeah, let me just, I've been in this giant axe in my hand.

625
00:35:22,000 --> 00:35:23,000
It's like, 180 pounds.

626
00:35:23,000 --> 00:35:24,000
Let me just hold it with one hand.

627
00:35:25,000 --> 00:35:27,000
It's not even doing any sweet animation.

628
00:35:29,000 --> 00:35:30,000
There's no sweet animation with that.

629
00:35:32,000 --> 00:35:33,000
This is so hard.

630
00:35:35,000 --> 00:35:37,000
My brain, like, cannot handle how this looks.

631
00:35:37,000 --> 00:35:39,000
It actually looks like kind of normal to be honest.

632
00:35:42,000 --> 00:35:44,000
I feel like that's the way like a shotgun would act in somebody's hands.

633
00:35:46,000 --> 00:35:47,000
Like, that one, God.

634
00:35:47,000 --> 00:35:50,000
I'm gonna have those kills with this enforcer.

635
00:35:50,000 --> 00:35:52,000
Oh, let me just one second guys.

636
00:35:52,000 --> 00:35:55,000
Let me spin up my like 200 pound axe in one hand.

637
00:35:55,000 --> 00:35:55,000
Let me go.

638
00:35:57,000 --> 00:35:59,000
I'm gonna look at how useful this is gonna be.

639
00:35:59,000 --> 00:36:01,000
Come on, I gotta kill him with it.

640
00:36:07,000 --> 00:36:07,000
Wait.

641
00:36:07,000 --> 00:36:10,000
I can't run now.

642
00:36:10,000 --> 00:36:12,000
Who keep, whoa, that was weird.

643
00:36:13,000 --> 00:36:14,000
No swing animation.

644
00:36:15,000 --> 00:36:16,000
You can't tell, I got it.

645
00:36:23,000 --> 00:36:25,000
Burger boy, the insensitive one.

646
00:36:25,000 --> 00:36:27,000
Burger boy, you can't call a medic man.

647
00:36:27,000 --> 00:36:28,000
Nobody has it.

648
00:36:29,000 --> 00:36:33,000
It could be like a heavy with the damn crits.

649
00:36:33,000 --> 00:36:33,000
Pretty good.

650
00:36:33,000 --> 00:36:34,000
A medic on.

651
00:36:37,000 --> 00:36:41,000
Engineer with the Natasha, the winger, and the atomizer.

652
00:36:41,000 --> 00:36:42,000
Can I double, can I triple jump?

653
00:36:43,000 --> 00:36:44,000
I can double jump.

654
00:36:45,000 --> 00:36:47,000
I can double jump as the engineer.

655
00:36:50,000 --> 00:36:51,000
Well, the atomizer.

656
00:36:51,000 --> 00:36:52,000
Yeah, I have the atomizer with the ng.

657
00:36:52,000 --> 00:36:54,000
I can double jump and I can build building.

658
00:36:54,000 --> 00:36:55,000
That's five.

659
00:36:55,000 --> 00:37:00,000
I get the cool setup and I die instantly.

660
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:01,000
This happens every single time.

661
00:37:02,000 --> 00:37:03,000
I turn the corner.

662
00:37:03,000 --> 00:37:05,000
Oh, that was a spy.

663
00:37:05,000 --> 00:37:07,000
So I was going invisible behind people in my force in nature.

664
00:37:10,000 --> 00:37:11,000
It's visible.

665
00:37:11,000 --> 00:37:13,000
That's crazy.

666
00:37:13,000 --> 00:37:14,000
Turn a singer song.

667
00:37:14,000 --> 00:37:17,000
That's somebody just, um, come on.

668
00:37:18,000 --> 00:37:20,000
Winger, oh, let me, let me hold, let me just,

669
00:37:21,000 --> 00:37:22,000
just stupid.

670
00:37:22,000 --> 00:37:24,000
It's like a little, no words can describe that.

671
00:37:24,000 --> 00:37:26,000
I can't even make a joke.

672
00:37:26,000 --> 00:37:26,000
It's too stupid.

673
00:37:30,000 --> 00:37:32,000
Oh, god, that's a dead, that's a dying battle right there.

674
00:37:33,000 --> 00:37:34,000
I have to revolver.

675
00:37:35,000 --> 00:37:36,000
My spy has three hands.

676
00:37:39,000 --> 00:37:40,000
Because I'm holding killing gloves of boxing.

677
00:37:40,000 --> 00:37:41,000
I pull out my dandering.

678
00:37:41,000 --> 00:37:43,000
This setup is terrible.

679
00:37:44,000 --> 00:37:46,000
Scout with a mini gun.

680
00:37:46,000 --> 00:37:47,000
Everyone run through your life.

681
00:37:51,000 --> 00:37:53,000
T-go challenges me to a duel.

682
00:37:57,000 --> 00:37:59,000
Yeah, I wonder how mad Bergerboy is right now.

683
00:38:01,000 --> 00:38:04,000
I bet you Bergerboy is screaming at his computer screen.

684
00:38:06,000 --> 00:38:08,000
I healed for a hundred points as a sniper.

685
00:38:10,000 --> 00:38:10,000
Extend.

686
00:38:11,000 --> 00:38:12,000
This way, am I holding this backwards?

687
00:38:14,000 --> 00:38:15,000
All right, look at how I'm holding this.

688
00:38:15,000 --> 00:38:17,000
I could really hurt myself with this thing.

689
00:38:17,000 --> 00:38:18,000
Suck this a bit.

690
00:38:19,000 --> 00:38:20,000
Fish cake?

691
00:38:22,000 --> 00:38:22,000
Oh, it still works.

692
00:38:25,000 --> 00:38:30,000
All right, we'll be launching your fish cake, and the backwards X thing was your.

693
00:38:31,000 --> 00:38:33,000
Mm-hmm, yeah, make sure don't drop it on your face.

694
00:38:37,000 --> 00:38:38,000
I have two shotguns.

695
00:38:38,000 --> 00:38:39,000
Scout are going to family business.

696
00:38:41,000 --> 00:38:43,000
I have the syringe gun of the heavy.

697
00:38:43,000 --> 00:38:44,000
I don't like this.

698
00:38:44,000 --> 00:38:46,000
Watch this you didn't kill me!

699
00:38:46,000 --> 00:38:53,000
What what that I am confused that was weird

700
00:38:53,000 --> 00:39:03,000
I was doing the heavy mini gun noise

701
00:39:03,000 --> 00:39:13,000
Charging charge can I charge out of the sniper?

702
00:39:13,000 --> 00:39:19,000
I can't oh I can't charge dammit what?

703
00:39:19,000 --> 00:39:26,000
I'm a spy and all I have is the tribal and ship I don't have any other item

704
00:39:26,000 --> 00:39:28,000
Can you cloak?

705
00:39:28,000 --> 00:39:30,000
Yeah

706
00:39:30,000 --> 00:39:34,000
I wish I could charge in charge right there that would have been hilarious

707
00:39:34,000 --> 00:39:38,000
I just spawned and for some reason I spawned with like 350 health

708
00:39:38,000 --> 00:39:42,000
Overhealed yeah I think some of the people do so I think everyone does be honest

709
00:39:42,000 --> 00:39:46,000
I'm spawning overhealed I have a rocket jumper

710
00:39:46,000 --> 00:39:48,000
I guess no maybe not everybody

711
00:39:48,000 --> 00:39:52,000
But like a razor back okay this is actually a pretty good setup

712
00:39:52,000 --> 00:39:54,000
I know I can't charge

713
00:39:54,000 --> 00:39:57,000
Oh this sucks nevermind

714
00:39:57,000 --> 00:40:01,000
That's a little worse setup ever

715
00:40:01,000 --> 00:40:04,000
I got a razor back though I can't be back

716
00:40:07,000 --> 00:40:13,000
I had Gerati rocket jumper and equalizer

717
00:40:13,000 --> 00:40:15,000
I can't charge this sucks

718
00:40:15,000 --> 00:40:19,000
This is the worst thing

719
00:40:19,000 --> 00:40:23,000
I'm a spy with a tribal and ship and that is literally it

720
00:40:23,000 --> 00:40:30,000
If you should be a duel I'll deal you I'll do anybody why not?

721
00:40:30,000 --> 00:40:33,000
Absolutely

722
00:40:33,000 --> 00:40:38,000
Dead rig or heavy

723
00:40:38,000 --> 00:40:40,000
Both of the next map let's go to

724
00:40:40,000 --> 00:40:42,000
Bad water?

725
00:40:42,000 --> 00:40:44,000
Bad water sounds fun

726
00:40:44,000 --> 00:40:48,000
I have soldier with a big urner and the enforcer

727
00:40:48,000 --> 00:40:52,000
I can't do the taunt, dammit the taunt doesn't work with this thing

728
00:40:52,000 --> 00:40:54,000
What the hell?

729
00:40:54,000 --> 00:40:56,000
I'm better off just using this

730
00:40:59,000 --> 00:41:03,000
Oh what's the Scottish resistance? I have no idea how this works

731
00:41:03,000 --> 00:41:06,000
Okay

732
00:41:07,000 --> 00:41:11,000
Look at that's just pointing straight down into the ground that's so funny

733
00:41:13,000 --> 00:41:16,000
Oh this thing's great with people jumping

734
00:41:25,000 --> 00:41:28,000
I don't think I've ever seen the guy I'm doing one time

735
00:41:29,000 --> 00:41:35,000
Oh my god that guy just got so many people in that Natasha

736
00:41:35,000 --> 00:41:41,000
This will be the last round of the randomizer and then we'll go to one more random server

737
00:41:41,000 --> 00:41:48,000
And oh my god I'm a medic with the Natasha and the crit screen

738
00:41:48,000 --> 00:41:51,000
What I have for melee I didn't even read it

739
00:41:51,000 --> 00:41:53,000
Oh the wrench

740
00:41:53,000 --> 00:41:57,000
Oh you thought the medic was just going to be here and didn't ya?

741
00:41:57,000 --> 00:42:02,000
Oh my god this is so OP

742
00:42:02,000 --> 00:42:06,000
Now I just switch over

743
00:42:06,000 --> 00:42:10,000
Get some heals around you guys scrubbing around a little bit

744
00:42:10,000 --> 00:42:16,000
I'm a spy running around with heavy fists punching people

745
00:42:16,000 --> 00:42:20,000
Oh I got you I got you King DDD

746
00:42:20,000 --> 00:42:25,000
Oh come on give me those crits

747
00:42:25,000 --> 00:42:30,000
Come on come on where is somebody?

748
00:42:36,000 --> 00:42:39,000
God this is so insane

749
00:42:39,000 --> 00:42:43,000
Medic with a god damn mini god now you serious

750
00:42:43,000 --> 00:42:47,000
And I'm healing people with the crit screen this is ridiculous

751
00:42:47,000 --> 00:42:51,000
And I can upgrade and repair buildings

752
00:42:52,000 --> 00:42:55,000
Wait what's the big kill?

753
00:42:55,000 --> 00:42:58,000
It's a risk in the revolver

754
00:42:58,000 --> 00:43:00,000
So I have a revolver and I have a pistol

755
00:43:00,000 --> 00:43:02,000
I don't even know what he has what does he have

756
00:43:02,000 --> 00:43:06,000
Let's get the Scottish resistance

757
00:43:06,000 --> 00:43:10,000
Is that what he did something?

758
00:43:10,000 --> 00:43:15,000
Well what in the last like two seconds?

759
00:43:15,000 --> 00:43:18,000
I had the thing called a jar of ants

760
00:43:18,000 --> 00:43:21,000
I thought it was dry but when I threw it at people they would like taking damage

761
00:43:21,000 --> 00:43:23,000
I never seen that before

762
00:43:23,000 --> 00:43:25,000
That's weird

763
00:43:25,000 --> 00:43:28,000
I just healed a thousand points of the pyro

764
00:43:28,000 --> 00:43:32,000
I don't think it was even a pyro that was weird

765
00:43:36,000 --> 00:43:39,000
So because I'm a spy I have a wrench

766
00:43:39,000 --> 00:43:41,000
And I can either disguise

767
00:43:41,000 --> 00:43:43,000
But I can't build anything

768
00:43:43,000 --> 00:43:46,000
Alright shotgun, short circuit

769
00:43:46,000 --> 00:43:48,000
What is going on?

770
00:43:48,000 --> 00:43:52,000
I'm so confused, is this how he's holding the shotgun?

771
00:43:52,000 --> 00:43:54,000
Hold on

772
00:43:54,000 --> 00:43:58,000
So this is faster reserve

773
00:43:58,000 --> 00:44:01,000
Oh I have a knife too

774
00:44:01,000 --> 00:44:05,000
Okay I was holding the shotgun down like a mini gun

775
00:44:05,000 --> 00:44:07,000
And it was like shaking

776
00:44:07,000 --> 00:44:10,000
I couldn't even tell where I was shooting

777
00:44:12,000 --> 00:44:14,000
Alright so after this we're going to go to a normal one

778
00:44:14,000 --> 00:44:16,000
I'm getting the worst things ever

779
00:44:16,000 --> 00:44:19,000
Yeah I got a great one last time, the medic

780
00:44:19,000 --> 00:44:21,000
The medic set up

781
00:44:21,000 --> 00:44:23,000
Alright so

782
00:44:23,000 --> 00:44:26,000
Bonka, this is going to be great

783
00:44:26,000 --> 00:44:29,000
Bonka-togged punch, does it do anything?

784
00:44:29,000 --> 00:44:31,000
Am I invincible right?

785
00:44:31,000 --> 00:44:32,000
Yeah I am

786
00:44:32,000 --> 00:44:33,000
Sick

787
00:44:33,000 --> 00:44:37,000
I'm getting all these pistols

788
00:44:40,000 --> 00:44:41,000
What?

789
00:44:42,000 --> 00:44:43,000
I-

790
00:44:43,000 --> 00:44:44,000
Okay

791
00:44:44,000 --> 00:44:46,000
What's the Buffalo steak sandwich do again?

792
00:44:46,000 --> 00:44:50,000
Many crits and you take many crits but you can't use anything but melee

793
00:44:50,000 --> 00:44:53,000
That was weird, the no swing animation throws me off

794
00:44:53,000 --> 00:44:56,000
Because I'm just like standing there, am I even swinging at people?

795
00:45:00,000 --> 00:45:02,000
Oh it's tied up now

796
00:45:02,000 --> 00:45:06,000
Oh wait a minute, how does the Widowmaker even work?

797
00:45:06,000 --> 00:45:08,000
How would the Widowmaker work?

798
00:45:08,000 --> 00:45:10,000
Am I just a fitted ammo? Well how is this going to work?

799
00:45:10,000 --> 00:45:15,000
I think I just haven't fitted ammo

800
00:45:15,000 --> 00:45:18,000
Oh no I can't lose this, no shit

801
00:45:18,000 --> 00:45:23,000
Oh I really think I just had a fitted ammo with that thing

802
00:45:23,000 --> 00:45:28,000
We're getting my spawn draft now

803
00:45:28,000 --> 00:45:39,000
The Front View Justice had 10 shots in it, that's confusing

804
00:45:39,000 --> 00:45:44,000
Oh man

805
00:45:44,000 --> 00:45:47,000
Oh yeah I still have metal, I just can't see it

806
00:45:47,000 --> 00:45:49,000
That's still funny

807
00:45:49,000 --> 00:45:55,000
Alright, we're gonna go one more of random normal server to play

808
00:45:55,000 --> 00:45:58,000
And then we're gonna hop in a CS go

809
00:45:58,000 --> 00:46:01,000
Let's do, let's find another good server

810
00:46:01,000 --> 00:46:03,000
Shit out

811
00:46:03,000 --> 00:46:09,000
Let's try and get a 32 person

812
00:46:09,000 --> 00:46:11,000
Here we go

813
00:46:11,000 --> 00:46:13,000
Oh let's go back to her mind

814
00:46:13,000 --> 00:46:15,000
No no no

815
00:46:15,000 --> 00:46:17,000
Can go to Dust Bowl

816
00:46:17,000 --> 00:46:21,000
That's 30, that's got 32 right now

817
00:46:21,000 --> 00:46:23,000
Yeah we're gonna do it

818
00:46:23,000 --> 00:46:25,000
32 people can play in this zone

819
00:46:25,000 --> 00:46:27,000
This would be the last Shabang

820
00:46:27,000 --> 00:46:29,000
I gotta give it to Berga Boy first, hold on

821
00:46:29,000 --> 00:46:32,000
Berga Boy will like flip out if I don't

822
00:46:32,000 --> 00:46:36,000
And then ready, 96

823
00:46:36,000 --> 00:46:40,000
8, 113

824
00:46:40,000 --> 00:46:45,000
36, 27015

825
00:46:45,000 --> 00:46:47,000
And join

826
00:46:47,000 --> 00:46:49,000
And that's the server guys

827
00:46:49,000 --> 00:46:54,000
Go to all Dust Bowl, go to all Fashion Dust Bowl

828
00:46:54,000 --> 00:46:56,000
Oh it's not randomizer is it?

829
00:46:56,000 --> 00:46:58,000
No this is just regular

830
00:46:58,000 --> 00:46:59,000
Okay

831
00:46:59,000 --> 00:47:01,000
Oh yes Dust Bowl my favorite

832
00:47:01,000 --> 00:47:05,000
I like Dust Bowl, people don't like it but I like it

833
00:47:05,000 --> 00:47:09,000
I like it after that brass beast game yesterday

834
00:47:09,000 --> 00:47:13,000
So my buddy I'm from Providence, so cool dude

835
00:47:13,000 --> 00:47:17,000
Good old Rhode Island

836
00:47:20,000 --> 00:47:23,000
I got blue, why not?

837
00:47:23,000 --> 00:47:27,000
Mission begins in 50 seconds

838
00:47:27,000 --> 00:47:31,000
That's what I just said

839
00:47:31,000 --> 00:47:35,000
Oh Bull King, yeah I will absolutely do jailbreak

840
00:47:35,000 --> 00:47:39,000
Oh I have, while there's people here I need to mention this

841
00:47:39,000 --> 00:47:43,000
There is going to be no stream next weekend

842
00:47:43,000 --> 00:47:47,000
Because I'm gonna be a Paxies

843
00:47:47,000 --> 00:47:49,000
And I bring your computer with you

844
00:47:49,000 --> 00:47:53,000
Foring everything, that would not happen

845
00:47:53,000 --> 00:47:57,000
I'm gonna be a little bit weak, I just want to be very clear

846
00:47:57,000 --> 00:48:01,000
But the good part is I'm gonna get plenty of cool videos and packs

847
00:48:01,000 --> 00:48:05,000
And it'll be plenty of cool stuff to see from that stuff

848
00:48:05,000 --> 00:48:07,000
Do not worry

849
00:48:07,000 --> 00:48:11,000
So what do you actually do at Pax because I know nothing about game conventions?

850
00:48:11,000 --> 00:48:13,000
You just play new games

851
00:48:13,000 --> 00:48:17,000
It's just a convention where

852
00:48:17,000 --> 00:48:21,000
Pretty much every developer you can think of

853
00:48:21,000 --> 00:48:25,000
And it's just a great place to hang out

854
00:48:25,000 --> 00:48:27,000
There's a bunch of free play rooms

855
00:48:27,000 --> 00:48:31,000
They have like 100 Xboxes, 100 like PS3s

856
00:48:31,000 --> 00:48:33,000
Like 100 PCs all lined up

857
00:48:33,000 --> 00:48:37,000
You just go in and play with people that are in the room

858
00:48:37,000 --> 00:48:39,000
It's really interesting, it's definitely fun

859
00:48:39,000 --> 00:48:41,000
It's most of the games can you go and check out

860
00:48:41,000 --> 00:48:43,000
Or are you looking forward to checking out?

861
00:48:43,000 --> 00:48:45,000
I don't know man, nothing really

862
00:48:45,000 --> 00:48:49,000
I'm trying to think that there's anything I particularly would like to

863
00:48:49,000 --> 00:48:51,000
Portal 2?

864
00:48:51,000 --> 00:48:53,000
Yeah, do Portal 2 last year, I went last year

865
00:48:53,000 --> 00:48:59,000
The line for Portal 2 was like an hour and a half long to play the demo

866
00:48:59,000 --> 00:49:01,000
And like to see like the trailer and stuff

867
00:49:01,000 --> 00:49:05,000
It was like this enclosed off boxed off room

868
00:49:05,000 --> 00:49:07,000
And you couldn't get, you couldn't even see what was in there

869
00:49:07,000 --> 00:49:09,000
It was like a closed off box

870
00:49:09,000 --> 00:49:11,000
And the line went into the box

871
00:49:11,000 --> 00:49:15,000
So it was pretty nuts

872
00:49:15,000 --> 00:49:19,000
Do I live near the west end?

873
00:49:19,000 --> 00:49:21,000
I do not

874
00:49:21,000 --> 00:49:23,000
I do not live in the city

875
00:49:23,000 --> 00:49:27,000
I am just outside of the city

876
00:49:27,000 --> 00:49:31,000
Oh, a lot of peeps up here

877
00:49:31,000 --> 00:49:35,000
Oh, we got a double avar right there

878
00:49:35,000 --> 00:49:39,000
That's spy, watch yourself, that's me

879
00:49:39,000 --> 00:49:41,000
That's not me, or is it?

880
00:49:41,000 --> 00:49:43,000
Twilight Zone

881
00:49:43,000 --> 00:49:47,000
I just got freaked out right there

882
00:49:47,000 --> 00:49:51,000
Oh god

883
00:49:51,000 --> 00:49:53,000
Oh

884
00:49:53,000 --> 00:49:59,000
Spam out the door

885
00:49:59,000 --> 00:50:03,000
Oh my god, is that, is that what I think it is?

886
00:50:03,000 --> 00:50:05,000
Is that Berger Boy?

887
00:50:05,000 --> 00:50:07,000
It is

888
00:50:07,000 --> 00:50:09,000
That's not a spy

889
00:50:09,000 --> 00:50:13,000
Do it

890
00:50:13,000 --> 00:50:17,000
I am kind of doing this up then

891
00:50:17,000 --> 00:50:25,000
Oh, appearance from MLC Dad

892
00:50:25,000 --> 00:50:27,000
MLC Pop, Illnessy Pop

893
00:50:27,000 --> 00:50:29,000
MLC Pop

894
00:50:29,000 --> 00:50:33,000
Yeah, he is a better than Red Sox

895
00:50:33,000 --> 00:50:37,000
How could you say such a thing

896
00:50:37,000 --> 00:50:43,000
Oh, I just got destroyed right there

897
00:50:43,000 --> 00:50:45,000
Damn

898
00:50:49,000 --> 00:50:53,000
Oh no, this is spy

899
00:50:53,000 --> 00:50:57,000
We got to get around, I am going around

900
00:50:57,000 --> 00:51:01,000
They are taking over, huh? They are up on the top

901
00:51:01,000 --> 00:51:03,000
Nice reflect

902
00:51:03,000 --> 00:51:05,000
You know what? I am going to go medic

903
00:51:05,000 --> 00:51:07,000
We need another one

904
00:51:07,000 --> 00:51:11,000
We need another medic

905
00:51:11,000 --> 00:51:15,000
Oh auto-com inbound

906
00:51:15,000 --> 00:51:19,000
Yeah, what up?

907
00:51:19,000 --> 00:51:21,000
In my next vlog

908
00:51:21,000 --> 00:51:25,000
Auto will do like a gameplay commentary

909
00:51:25,000 --> 00:51:27,000
Oh, let me get that

910
00:51:27,000 --> 00:51:31,000
Oh no, you heard it here first

911
00:51:31,000 --> 00:51:33,000
Auto was going to do a gameplay commentary

912
00:51:33,000 --> 00:51:35,000
I don't want to do my next vlog

913
00:51:35,000 --> 00:51:39,000
Oh god, that is not safe

914
00:51:39,000 --> 00:51:45,000
Oh, you don't stop

915
00:51:45,000 --> 00:51:49,000
No, stay alive, where is he?

916
00:51:49,000 --> 00:51:51,000
Where is he?

917
00:51:51,000 --> 00:51:53,000
He is trying to kill too many people in the way

918
00:51:53,000 --> 00:51:57,000
Alright, what do you say man?

919
00:51:57,000 --> 00:51:59,000
What do you do?

920
00:51:59,000 --> 00:52:03,000
Chris, Chris, Chris

921
00:52:03,000 --> 00:52:05,000
Yeah, that is my dog

922
00:52:05,000 --> 00:52:07,000
People like who is auto

923
00:52:07,000 --> 00:52:09,000
That is my dog

924
00:52:11,000 --> 00:52:13,000
That is my good old dog

925
00:52:17,000 --> 00:52:19,000
Gotcha

926
00:52:19,000 --> 00:52:21,000
No, no

927
00:52:21,000 --> 00:52:25,000
I am doing something

928
00:52:25,000 --> 00:52:27,000
Oh, MLC mom

929
00:52:29,000 --> 00:52:31,000
Do they have YouTube channels?

930
00:52:31,000 --> 00:52:33,000
Yeah, they do

931
00:52:35,000 --> 00:52:39,000
No, they are doing Minecraft, don't they?

932
00:52:39,000 --> 00:52:43,000
Wow, you just saved my life

933
00:52:43,000 --> 00:52:45,000
No, I didn't

934
00:52:49,000 --> 00:52:51,000
Auto, auto the dog

935
00:52:51,000 --> 00:52:53,000
He is out of the way

936
00:52:53,000 --> 00:52:55,000
Auto, scout on the point

937
00:52:55,000 --> 00:52:57,000
He is trying to find him

938
00:52:57,000 --> 00:52:59,000
He is trying to find my dog

939
00:52:59,000 --> 00:53:01,000
Auto

940
00:53:01,000 --> 00:53:03,000
Did he just run in here?

941
00:53:03,000 --> 00:53:05,000
Okay, my dog just ran in here

942
00:53:05,000 --> 00:53:07,000
I heard the chinchy, I am looking at the screen

943
00:53:07,000 --> 00:53:09,000
I am trying to clap and get him to come over

944
00:53:09,000 --> 00:53:11,000
No, he is not even in here

945
00:53:11,000 --> 00:53:13,000
I am going insane

946
00:53:13,000 --> 00:53:15,000
Look at all these people that need healing

947
00:53:15,000 --> 00:53:17,000
No, I was lucky

948
00:53:17,000 --> 00:53:19,000
I don't know what he is doing

949
00:53:19,000 --> 00:53:21,000
I am going to kill him

950
00:53:21,000 --> 00:53:23,000
I know that need healing

951
00:53:23,000 --> 00:53:25,000
No, I was lucky

952
00:53:25,000 --> 00:53:27,000
I don't think he is dead

953
00:53:27,000 --> 00:53:29,000
Oh, God

954
00:53:29,000 --> 00:53:31,000
Yeah

955
00:53:31,000 --> 00:53:33,000
All right, new course of action

956
00:53:33,000 --> 00:53:37,000
I am just charging up my Uber

957
00:53:37,000 --> 00:53:39,000
And they were going in

958
00:53:39,000 --> 00:53:43,000
Do I know any Irish?

959
00:53:43,000 --> 00:53:45,000
I do not know any Irish

960
00:53:45,000 --> 00:53:47,000
How much do you know?

961
00:53:47,000 --> 00:53:49,000
I know Irish people

962
00:53:49,000 --> 00:53:51,000
But I do not know

963
00:53:51,000 --> 00:53:53,000
Language

964
00:53:53,000 --> 00:53:55,000
How to speak it

965
00:53:55,000 --> 00:53:57,000
Who do you know any Irish?

966
00:53:57,000 --> 00:53:59,000
I mean even though you are not

967
00:53:59,000 --> 00:54:01,000
I just bite

968
00:54:01,000 --> 00:54:03,000
I cannot even speak Welsh

969
00:54:03,000 --> 00:54:05,000
Which is like my own city's language

970
00:54:05,000 --> 00:54:07,000
Or a bad answer language

971
00:54:07,000 --> 00:54:09,000
Does it really?

972
00:54:09,000 --> 00:54:11,000
Welsh yeah

973
00:54:11,000 --> 00:54:13,000
No, well, anyone speaks it in this country

974
00:54:13,000 --> 00:54:15,000
That is crazy

975
00:54:15,000 --> 00:54:17,000
I do not know they have an actual

976
00:54:17,000 --> 00:54:19,000
English

977
00:54:19,000 --> 00:54:21,000
Don't open that door

978
00:54:21,000 --> 00:54:23,000
Burger boys out there

979
00:54:25,000 --> 00:54:27,000
Oh, it would be bad

980
00:54:27,000 --> 00:54:29,000
It would be bad if burger boy got in here

981
00:54:29,000 --> 00:54:31,000
Oh, close that door

982
00:54:31,000 --> 00:54:33,000
Do not let burger boy in here

983
00:54:33,000 --> 00:54:37,000
He just moved

984
00:54:37,000 --> 00:54:39,000
And open it now

985
00:54:39,000 --> 00:54:41,000
Don't open it

986
00:54:41,000 --> 00:54:43,000
I love how we just got this guy here

987
00:54:43,000 --> 00:54:45,000
Like holding this like, all right

988
00:54:45,000 --> 00:54:47,000
We do it here

989
00:54:47,000 --> 00:54:49,000
Oh, turn around, oh, jeez

990
00:54:49,000 --> 00:54:51,000
No, no

991
00:54:51,000 --> 00:54:53,000
Oh my god, they came from behind

992
00:54:53,000 --> 00:54:55,000
Actually, that is damn

993
00:54:55,000 --> 00:54:57,000
I am going to fugue

994
00:54:57,000 --> 00:54:59,000
I am going to spy

995
00:54:59,000 --> 00:55:01,000
I am going to go

996
00:55:01,000 --> 00:55:03,000
So I

997
00:55:03,000 --> 00:55:05,000
The original sounds so cool

998
00:55:05,000 --> 00:55:07,000
If I was going to play Highland

999
00:55:07,000 --> 00:55:09,000
Or what would I play for a class

1000
00:55:09,000 --> 00:55:11,000
Probably Engineer

1001
00:55:11,000 --> 00:55:13,000
I am like most comfortable playing Engineer

1002
00:55:13,000 --> 00:55:15,000
I knew you were a freak

1003
00:55:15,000 --> 00:55:17,000
I could smell you

1004
00:55:17,000 --> 00:55:19,000
Can I feel it?

1005
00:55:19,000 --> 00:55:21,000
Oh, I was waiting for him to try and stare at him

1006
00:55:21,000 --> 00:55:23,000
And I got killed

1007
00:55:23,000 --> 00:55:25,000
Either Engineer

1008
00:55:25,000 --> 00:55:27,000
Or

1009
00:55:27,000 --> 00:55:29,000
Maybe Pyro

1010
00:55:29,000 --> 00:55:31,000
Just because Pyro

1011
00:55:31,000 --> 00:55:33,000
I could probably do what we needed to be done

1012
00:55:33,000 --> 00:55:37,000
Hey, I am Pyro

1013
00:55:37,000 --> 00:55:39,000
He is not dead

1014
00:55:39,000 --> 00:55:41,000
There is no way he is dead

1015
00:55:41,000 --> 00:55:45,000
No, come on

1016
00:55:45,000 --> 00:55:47,000
No, here comes the chase

1017
00:55:47,000 --> 00:55:49,000
D-d-d-d-d-d-d-d-d-d-d die

1018
00:55:49,000 --> 00:55:51,000
D-d-d-d-d-d-d-d-d-d die

1019
00:55:51,000 --> 00:55:53,000
Wrestlemania 28

1020
00:55:53,000 --> 00:55:55,000
I got people that are at Wrestlemania 28

1021
00:55:55,000 --> 00:55:57,000
Friends of mine that are there right now

1022
00:55:57,000 --> 00:55:59,000
Oh, and they're there

1023
00:55:59,000 --> 00:56:01,000
They haven't even done it

1024
00:56:01,000 --> 00:56:03,000
They are on scene out of the rock

1025
00:56:03,000 --> 00:56:05,000
I used to be big into wrestling man

1026
00:56:05,000 --> 00:56:07,000
I used to love it

1027
00:56:07,000 --> 00:56:09,000
Not so much anymore though

1028
00:56:09,000 --> 00:56:15,000
Oh my god. Hey, what's up everybody? I'm just gonna like stuff myself into your face. Oh no.

1029
00:56:15,000 --> 00:56:24,000
Yeah, you know, don't let that time and stone cold stun the entire McMahon family. Actually, I do. I'll link that and then the rock rock bottom. Oh my god. Somebody please.

1030
00:56:24,000 --> 00:56:26,000
Thank you. Thank you.

1031
00:56:30,000 --> 00:56:36,000
I'm just being an idiot right now. Oh, I can't play spines. It's not possible right now.

1032
00:56:37,000 --> 00:56:41,000
Playing heavy. I'm not gonna be happy. I'm gonna use.

1033
00:56:42,000 --> 00:56:44,000
Okay, we're being like 10 seconds.

1034
00:56:45,000 --> 00:56:46,000
BRBB.

1035
00:56:50,000 --> 00:56:53,000
Check dot, well, this one dot, well, this.

1036
00:56:57,000 --> 00:57:00,000
I'll do one Minecraft. I mean, we're trying to.

1037
00:57:00,000 --> 00:57:06,000
The latest Minecraft thing that me left her in a toxic. We're having a lot of server problems. It would be crashing all the time.

1038
00:57:06,000 --> 00:57:12,000
And I don't know. We might try and do something else at some point just because it was. Hey me.

1039
00:57:12,000 --> 00:57:17,000
Is that another spy? I think so. Come on. We can do this.

1040
00:57:17,000 --> 00:57:20,000
Oh, no, we can't.

1041
00:57:22,000 --> 00:57:26,000
Eat the sandwich. The only thing you can do.

1042
00:57:27,000 --> 00:57:32,000
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no. Where's my dog?

1043
00:57:32,000 --> 00:57:35,000
Auto. Auto.

1044
00:57:38,000 --> 00:57:40,000
I'm gonna get him in here.

1045
00:57:40,000 --> 00:57:44,000
Auto, you're gonna do like a face cam video.

1046
00:57:50,000 --> 00:57:53,000
Auto face cam. Let's see if I can do it.

1047
00:57:54,000 --> 00:57:59,000
He's not gonna come in here. He's like, no way. I'm back.

1048
00:57:59,000 --> 00:58:04,000
They're all I help Mr. or mom on top of stuff or something.

1049
00:58:05,000 --> 00:58:07,000
Nice, nice.

1050
00:58:07,000 --> 00:58:10,000
I'm gonna take the brass beast off of this one.

1051
00:58:11,000 --> 00:58:15,000
What do I think? Oh, he's tummy. What's the worst game ever?

1052
00:58:16,000 --> 00:58:17,000
Hmm.

1053
00:58:20,000 --> 00:58:26,000
I don't know. What's the worst game ever played?

1054
00:58:26,000 --> 00:58:32,000
Borderlands. That's tough one. No, it's definitely not. Not Borderlands. Not for me.

1055
00:58:32,000 --> 00:58:37,000
Borderlands. I don't know what I have such a thing against Borderlands.

1056
00:58:37,000 --> 00:58:41,000
You made you bought it. Come on.

1057
00:58:41,000 --> 00:58:44,000
Oh, I'm not dead.

1058
00:58:45,000 --> 00:58:50,000
I just heard a spot. That's where the god I did. Yeah, I knew I did. I knew I did.

1059
00:58:50,000 --> 00:58:56,000
I heard him, but I got killed anyways. Wait, they have seven spies?

1060
00:58:56,000 --> 00:58:59,000
Oh my god.

1061
00:59:07,000 --> 00:59:10,000
Oh, there's another one.

1062
00:59:12,000 --> 00:59:14,000
Thanks.

1063
00:59:14,000 --> 00:59:19,000
Worst game. Recently the worst game I played.

1064
00:59:21,000 --> 00:59:24,000
I can't think of one.

1065
00:59:24,000 --> 00:59:25,000
I heard that mermaid.

1066
00:59:25,000 --> 00:59:29,000
About that dark side. This is something like that.

1067
00:59:29,000 --> 00:59:31,000
Dark side. We just always say.

1068
00:59:31,000 --> 00:59:32,000
What am I doing?

1069
00:59:32,000 --> 00:59:37,000
There's something about this. I don't know. A new game that came out, which is kind of like.

1070
00:59:37,000 --> 00:59:39,000
It was like an indie game.

1071
00:59:39,000 --> 00:59:43,000
I like Nova did a playthrough on it. I know it's all the I am alive.

1072
00:59:43,000 --> 00:59:46,000
Go. Get him off.

1073
00:59:46,000 --> 00:59:49,000
All right. This will be the last round. That was too quick.

1074
00:59:49,000 --> 00:59:52,000
Last run before we go to CS go.

1075
00:59:52,000 --> 00:59:56,000
Counter strike. Go, go, go.

1076
00:59:56,000 --> 01:00:01,000
And what's Ghost stand for? Oh, just go. Ghost.

1077
01:00:01,000 --> 01:00:04,000
Kind of strike like move. Go forward.

1078
01:00:04,000 --> 01:00:08,000
I have to appear offline.

1079
01:00:08,000 --> 01:00:10,000
Oh, my fan. Can you start?

1080
01:00:10,000 --> 01:00:16,000
Yeah, just when we get into CS go to the top of us.

1081
01:00:16,000 --> 01:00:18,000
That's totally cool.

1082
01:00:18,000 --> 01:00:20,000
That's totally fan.

1083
01:00:20,000 --> 01:00:23,000
How do I do this?

1084
01:00:23,000 --> 01:00:26,000
What am I doing?

1085
01:00:26,000 --> 01:00:32,000
Actually, I'll stay online. I'll do that after we win the switch.

1086
01:00:32,000 --> 01:00:36,000
All right. If we get rolled again, this is not good news.

1087
01:00:36,000 --> 01:00:39,000
Get your crits Creek on the pyro now for this.

1088
01:00:39,000 --> 01:00:41,000
Oh, yeah.

1089
01:00:41,000 --> 01:00:46,000
You'll be able to see that video soon on Who Man 61?

1090
01:00:46,000 --> 01:00:49,000
You actually will.

1091
01:00:49,000 --> 01:00:53,000
Come to you soon on the new Team Fortress 2 exclusive channel.

1092
01:00:53,000 --> 01:00:55,000
I just get it.

1093
01:00:55,000 --> 01:00:57,000
I wish. No.

1094
01:00:57,000 --> 01:01:00,000
Let's do it.

1095
01:01:00,000 --> 01:01:02,000
That's a spy.

1096
01:01:02,000 --> 01:01:03,000
Holy moly.

1097
01:01:03,000 --> 01:01:06,000
Oh, my god.

1098
01:01:06,000 --> 01:01:12,000
Why did I jump down?

1099
01:01:12,000 --> 01:01:14,000
Dustball is crazy.

1100
01:01:14,000 --> 01:01:17,000
It's like no respawns to like no respawn delay.

1101
01:01:17,000 --> 01:01:20,000
We're getting absolutely destroyed right now.

1102
01:01:20,000 --> 01:01:26,000
The control point just being captured.

1103
01:01:26,000 --> 01:01:30,000
That's why he's still alive.

1104
01:01:30,000 --> 01:01:32,000
All right.

1105
01:01:32,000 --> 01:01:33,000
Fall back.

1106
01:01:33,000 --> 01:01:35,000
Watch your back, Stu.

1107
01:01:35,000 --> 01:01:37,000
No, he got out of here.

1108
01:01:37,000 --> 01:01:39,000
He's gonna fly out.

1109
01:01:39,000 --> 01:01:41,000
Thank you very much.

1110
01:01:41,000 --> 01:01:43,000
Thank you.

1111
01:01:43,000 --> 01:01:47,000
Thank you.

1112
01:01:47,000 --> 01:01:51,000
This way.

1113
01:01:51,000 --> 01:01:54,000
All right.

1114
01:01:54,000 --> 01:01:58,000
Keep the deep fats.

1115
01:01:58,000 --> 01:02:00,000
Keep up the deep fats.

1116
01:02:00,000 --> 01:02:02,000
Watch the spy gap.

1117
01:02:02,000 --> 01:02:05,000
Watch the spy gap.

1118
01:02:05,000 --> 01:02:09,000
If I could be any class in TF2, I definitely would be the spy.

1119
01:02:09,000 --> 01:02:12,000
You could just go invisible and not die in real life.

1120
01:02:12,000 --> 01:02:14,000
Yeah, you could just never die.

1121
01:02:14,000 --> 01:02:15,000
I go, hey, go ahead.

1122
01:02:15,000 --> 01:02:16,000
Shoot me in the face.

1123
01:02:16,000 --> 01:02:17,000
I'm like, you're like,

1124
01:02:17,000 --> 01:02:20,000
I'm just gonna candle or something.

1125
01:02:20,000 --> 01:02:22,000
I'm fortunate like that.

1126
01:02:22,000 --> 01:02:25,000
I go, yeah, you can go ahead and put like three bullets in my head.

1127
01:02:25,000 --> 01:02:27,000
And I'll just deadbringer.

1128
01:02:27,000 --> 01:02:28,000
Oh.

1129
01:02:28,000 --> 01:02:31,000
That jermis is spy.

1130
01:02:31,000 --> 01:02:33,000
That'd be really weird.

1131
01:02:33,000 --> 01:02:35,000
Think about that in real life.

1132
01:02:35,000 --> 01:02:36,000
The deadbringer, right?

1133
01:02:36,000 --> 01:02:40,000
Let's say, let's say you had a gun and I had the deadbringer and you shot me.

1134
01:02:40,000 --> 01:02:42,000
And I had the deadbringer and deadbringer up.

1135
01:02:42,000 --> 01:02:46,000
So it would drop like a dummy body of me, but I would still be alive.

1136
01:02:46,000 --> 01:02:49,000
Like up here, again, would it be the same body?

1137
01:02:49,000 --> 01:02:52,000
What if you disguised as Birgoboys and you went to Birgoboys house?

1138
01:02:52,000 --> 01:02:55,000
You were like, hey, Birgoboys.

1139
01:02:55,000 --> 01:02:58,000
Oh, I just talked to Birgoboys like parents.

1140
01:02:58,000 --> 01:03:02,000
Hey, what's going on, Mr. and Mrs. Birgoboys.

1141
01:03:02,000 --> 01:03:07,000
All right.

1142
01:03:07,000 --> 01:03:08,000
Block that spy.

1143
01:03:08,000 --> 01:03:09,000
He's gonna try and get in mind.

1144
01:03:09,000 --> 01:03:10,000
Grono.

1145
01:03:10,000 --> 01:03:11,000
Careful.

1146
01:03:11,000 --> 01:03:12,000
Ooh.

1147
01:03:12,000 --> 01:03:14,000
Turn on, girl.

1148
01:03:14,000 --> 01:03:19,000
I turned around to fight the first spy and I got back stabbed by another spy that

1149
01:03:19,000 --> 01:03:20,000
came behind me.

1150
01:03:20,000 --> 01:03:23,000
Oh, the theme is a spy.

1151
01:03:23,000 --> 01:03:25,000
It's spy in the base.

1152
01:03:25,000 --> 01:03:28,000
Red is spy in the base.

1153
01:03:28,000 --> 01:03:35,000
Pi in the base.

1154
01:03:35,000 --> 01:03:37,000
That's spy.

1155
01:03:37,000 --> 01:03:41,000
No, it's not.

1156
01:03:42,000 --> 01:03:43,000
Can't hear that spy.

1157
01:03:43,000 --> 01:03:44,000
That's a spy.

1158
01:03:44,000 --> 01:03:45,000
No, it's not.

1159
01:03:45,000 --> 01:03:48,000
I have so conscious right now, I'm like freaking out.

1160
01:03:48,000 --> 01:03:55,000
That's a critter on a way.

1161
01:03:55,000 --> 01:03:56,000
Oh, he's faster.

1162
01:03:56,000 --> 01:03:58,000
He's still alive.

1163
01:03:58,000 --> 01:04:05,000
We need some serious spray action going on over here.

1164
01:04:05,000 --> 01:04:06,000
Oh, gonna go up.

1165
01:04:06,000 --> 01:04:08,000
No!

1166
01:04:08,000 --> 01:04:10,000
Run, run, run, run.

1167
01:04:10,000 --> 01:04:13,000
Run away from that.

1168
01:04:13,000 --> 01:04:14,000
Drive the sandwich.

1169
01:04:14,000 --> 01:04:15,000
Where's my sandwich?

1170
01:04:15,000 --> 01:04:20,000
Somebody eat it.

1171
01:04:20,000 --> 01:04:22,000
I just bumped into it by...

1172
01:04:22,000 --> 01:04:23,000
I knew it.

1173
01:04:23,000 --> 01:04:26,000
I knew it.

1174
01:04:26,000 --> 01:04:31,000
Let's go this way.

1175
01:04:31,000 --> 01:04:33,000
Oh no.

1176
01:04:33,000 --> 01:04:39,000
Kilometric.

1177
01:04:39,000 --> 01:04:42,000
Oh my god.

1178
01:04:42,000 --> 01:04:45,000
My sandwich.

1179
01:04:45,000 --> 01:04:48,000
Fall back.

1180
01:04:48,000 --> 01:04:51,000
No!

1181
01:04:51,000 --> 01:04:54,000
There we go.

1182
01:04:54,000 --> 01:04:57,000
This is going to be a losing battle.

1183
01:04:57,000 --> 01:05:05,000
I got a pack stat.

1184
01:05:05,000 --> 01:05:08,000
At least we're holding them, right?

1185
01:05:08,000 --> 01:05:12,000
Man, is there a spy right here?

1186
01:05:12,000 --> 01:05:15,000
What's going on there?

1187
01:05:15,000 --> 01:05:18,000
That was like a freak out session.

1188
01:05:18,000 --> 01:05:21,000
Let's go, let's go, let's go.

1189
01:05:21,000 --> 01:05:25,000
Oh no.

1190
01:05:25,000 --> 01:05:30,000
Run, run, run.

1191
01:05:30,000 --> 01:05:32,000
Oh, the spyrope.

1192
01:05:32,000 --> 01:05:34,000
Oh no.

1193
01:05:34,000 --> 01:05:36,000
I should probably stop sniping.

1194
01:05:36,000 --> 01:05:40,000
There's two spies behind this right now.

1195
01:05:40,000 --> 01:05:47,000
He's going to be right here in two seconds.

1196
01:05:47,000 --> 01:05:52,000
Every time.

1197
01:05:52,000 --> 01:05:55,000
Oh no, run away.

1198
01:05:55,000 --> 01:05:56,000
Oh, barely.

1199
01:05:56,000 --> 01:05:59,000
Oh, I'm going to still run away.

1200
01:05:59,000 --> 01:06:02,000
Oh.

1201
01:06:02,000 --> 01:06:05,000
You know, I was actually talking about Team Fortress and Chat.

1202
01:06:05,000 --> 01:06:07,000
The classic version.

1203
01:06:07,000 --> 01:06:11,000
You know what?

1204
01:06:11,000 --> 01:06:15,000
Oh.

1205
01:06:15,000 --> 01:06:18,000
Come on, kill the whole team.

1206
01:06:18,000 --> 01:06:20,000
Oh my god, I have a crit screen.

1207
01:06:20,000 --> 01:06:22,000
Oh my goodness.

1208
01:06:22,000 --> 01:06:24,000
That spy still behind us.

1209
01:06:24,000 --> 01:06:26,000
This could be really bad.

1210
01:06:26,000 --> 01:06:29,000
I was thinking about doing a Team Fortress 1 video.

1211
01:06:29,000 --> 01:06:31,000
Team Fortress Classic video.

1212
01:06:31,000 --> 01:06:38,000
Showing like what it looks like then and what it looks like now.

1213
01:06:38,000 --> 01:06:44,000
Oh.

1214
01:06:44,000 --> 01:06:49,000
Oh, there's another heavy right there too.

1215
01:06:49,000 --> 01:06:55,000
Oh.

1216
01:06:55,000 --> 01:06:59,000
Dude, it's still, you just did a.

1217
01:06:59,000 --> 01:07:04,000
Oh, get spread.

1218
01:07:04,000 --> 01:07:07,000
Oh my god, they got a spy cap us.

1219
01:07:07,000 --> 01:07:11,000
Somebody came back there.

1220
01:07:11,000 --> 01:07:14,000
The grenades in Team Fortress 1 was ridiculous.

1221
01:07:14,000 --> 01:07:19,000
You could never go back and play that and really seriously play it.

1222
01:07:19,000 --> 01:07:22,000
It's just ridiculous.

1223
01:07:22,000 --> 01:07:24,000
No, we know about the lose.

1224
01:07:24,000 --> 01:07:25,000
We're your bros of lose.

1225
01:07:25,000 --> 01:07:28,000
We are.

1226
01:07:28,000 --> 01:07:29,000
No, I forgot.

1227
01:07:29,000 --> 01:07:30,000
You can't do that anymore.

1228
01:07:30,000 --> 01:07:31,000
Shit.

1229
01:07:31,000 --> 01:07:32,000
Oh, you can't.

1230
01:07:32,000 --> 01:07:34,000
I just threw the sandwich down for myself.

1231
01:07:34,000 --> 01:07:37,000
I was like, oh, I got more ammo.

1232
01:07:37,000 --> 01:07:42,000
Turma, you can't do that anymore.

1233
01:07:42,000 --> 01:07:45,000
Team Fortress 2 with grenades would be.

1234
01:07:45,000 --> 01:07:46,000
Well, put it like this.

1235
01:07:46,000 --> 01:07:54,000
Imagine everybody on the team is a demo man and has their own loadouts.

1236
01:07:54,000 --> 01:07:56,000
We got to get up in that room.

1237
01:07:56,000 --> 01:08:03,000
Oh, this is the loadout.

1238
01:08:03,000 --> 01:08:04,000
Oh.

1239
01:08:04,000 --> 01:08:13,000
Yeah, this is this is this is where we're putting up a defense right now.

1240
01:08:13,000 --> 01:08:15,000
Oh, oh, my God.

1241
01:08:15,000 --> 01:08:21,000
This is you again.

1242
01:08:21,000 --> 01:08:28,000
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

1243
01:08:28,000 --> 01:08:30,000
Oh, how is he not dead?

1244
01:08:30,000 --> 01:08:37,000
My God.

1245
01:08:37,000 --> 01:08:38,000
Oh, no.

1246
01:08:38,000 --> 01:08:39,000
Yeah, that's where we are.

1247
01:08:39,000 --> 01:08:40,000
That's where we are.

1248
01:08:40,000 --> 01:08:47,000
That's where we are.

1249
01:08:47,000 --> 01:08:48,000
Good medic.

1250
01:08:48,000 --> 01:08:52,000
Good medic is good.

1251
01:08:52,000 --> 01:08:54,000
Oh, nice counter Dracula voice.

1252
01:08:54,000 --> 01:08:55,000
Oh, yeah, that's right.

1253
01:08:55,000 --> 01:08:59,000
Counter Dracula, they're heavy.

1254
01:08:59,000 --> 01:09:04,000
Oh, boy.

1255
01:09:04,000 --> 01:09:09,000
Oh, they're trying to build up over here.

1256
01:09:09,000 --> 01:09:10,000
Oh, it's bad news.

1257
01:09:10,000 --> 01:09:13,000
Bad news, bad news, bears.

1258
01:09:13,000 --> 01:09:14,000
I'm not sure.

1259
01:09:14,000 --> 01:09:15,000
Back up.

1260
01:09:15,000 --> 01:09:19,000
I don't want to get killed.

1261
01:09:19,000 --> 01:09:20,000
Oh, it's interesting.

1262
01:09:20,000 --> 01:09:21,000
I actually like audition.

1263
01:09:21,000 --> 01:09:22,000
What's your bad movie?

1264
01:09:22,000 --> 01:09:23,000
A drama.

1265
01:09:23,000 --> 01:09:24,000
What movie?

1266
01:09:24,000 --> 01:09:25,000
Bad news, bears.

1267
01:09:25,000 --> 01:09:26,000
What?

1268
01:09:26,000 --> 01:09:34,000
I was like a baseball player and they said, hey, anybody's football player, like things like

1269
01:09:34,000 --> 01:09:40,000
an actor, I come to this like open audition thing.

1270
01:09:40,000 --> 01:09:41,000
I do.

1271
01:09:41,000 --> 01:09:42,000
I do.

1272
01:09:42,000 --> 01:09:43,000
I do.

1273
01:09:43,000 --> 01:09:44,000
I do.

1274
01:09:44,000 --> 01:09:45,000
I try to do work.

1275
01:09:45,000 --> 01:09:46,000
Dude, I'm not.

1276
01:09:46,000 --> 01:09:51,000
I can imagine Billy Ballford because I was in drama in middle school so I was like, I'm

1277
01:09:51,000 --> 01:09:52,000
a good actor.

1278
01:09:52,000 --> 01:09:57,000
You could have been a star, dude.

1279
01:09:57,000 --> 01:10:00,000
Who's constant?

1280
01:10:00,000 --> 01:10:01,000
Back up, back up, back up.

1281
01:10:01,000 --> 01:10:02,000
Whoa.

1282
01:10:02,000 --> 01:10:05,000
Hey, look what console just said.

1283
01:10:05,000 --> 01:10:06,000
Who?

1284
01:10:06,000 --> 01:10:07,000
In the chatter, in the.

1285
01:10:07,000 --> 01:10:14,000
Somebody said, oh, so you got the livestream right now?

1286
01:10:14,000 --> 01:10:16,000
Well, thanks for choosing the QQ buffet.

1287
01:10:16,000 --> 01:10:17,000
Oh, really?

1288
01:10:17,000 --> 01:10:19,000
You were very welcome.

1289
01:10:19,000 --> 01:10:20,000
Oh, we're coming in.

1290
01:10:20,000 --> 01:10:21,000
We're coming in.

1291
01:10:21,000 --> 01:10:22,000
We're coming in.

1292
01:10:22,000 --> 01:10:23,000
Watch it.

1293
01:10:23,000 --> 01:10:24,000
Watch it.

1294
01:10:24,000 --> 01:10:26,000
Right when they turn the cool.

1295
01:10:26,000 --> 01:10:27,000
Oh.

1296
01:10:27,000 --> 01:10:28,000
Oh, well.

1297
01:10:28,000 --> 01:10:29,000
Yeah.

1298
01:10:29,000 --> 01:10:30,000
Oh, well.

1299
01:10:30,000 --> 01:10:31,000
Oh, I do.

1300
01:10:31,000 --> 01:10:32,000
Oh, no.

1301
01:10:32,000 --> 01:10:39,000
So this is like a legit stalemate right now.

1302
01:10:39,000 --> 01:10:42,000
I think because I want to get see us going.

1303
01:10:42,000 --> 01:10:46,000
So we might have to like 16 on 16.

1304
01:10:46,000 --> 01:10:49,000
Yeah, this is just a totally balanced game right now.

1305
01:10:49,000 --> 01:10:52,000
Even though we respond to ladies on Dust Bowl.

1306
01:10:52,000 --> 01:10:53,000
Yeah, I know.

1307
01:10:53,000 --> 01:10:54,000
You're just gonna.

1308
01:10:54,000 --> 01:10:56,000
Oh, he's gonna do it.

1309
01:10:56,000 --> 01:10:57,000
Oh, no.

1310
01:10:57,000 --> 01:11:04,000
Oh, I'm gonna go.

1311
01:11:04,000 --> 01:11:07,000
We got a ton of engineers, dude.

1312
01:11:07,000 --> 01:11:08,000
We can, no, we can't.

1313
01:11:08,000 --> 01:11:17,000
No, no, take you to what you're either.

1314
01:11:17,000 --> 01:11:18,000
Oh, I hear the fan.

1315
01:11:18,000 --> 01:11:20,000
See, your fan just turned on mine.

1316
01:11:20,000 --> 01:11:21,000
I've heard.

1317
01:11:21,000 --> 01:11:22,000
And I was probably.

1318
01:11:22,000 --> 01:11:25,000
Actually, that probably was mine.

1319
01:11:25,000 --> 01:11:26,000
You're right.

1320
01:11:26,000 --> 01:11:27,000
Oh, it's fine mine.

1321
01:11:27,000 --> 01:11:32,000
Oh, my look at this debris, my god.

1322
01:11:32,000 --> 01:11:33,000
Run.

1323
01:11:33,000 --> 01:11:34,000
Run away.

1324
01:11:34,000 --> 01:11:35,000
I'll be on the ground.

1325
01:11:35,000 --> 01:11:36,000
That's.

1326
01:11:36,000 --> 01:11:37,000
Run away.

1327
01:11:37,000 --> 01:11:39,000
I think afterburn you can tweak it.

1328
01:11:39,000 --> 01:11:40,000
Yeah.

1329
01:11:40,000 --> 01:11:41,000
I think afterburn you can tweak it.

1330
01:11:41,000 --> 01:11:42,000
You can.

1331
01:11:42,000 --> 01:11:43,000
Yeah.

1332
01:11:43,000 --> 01:11:44,000
Yeah.

1333
01:11:44,000 --> 01:11:45,000
Yeah.

1334
01:11:45,000 --> 01:11:48,000
I think afterburn you can tweak it.

1335
01:11:48,000 --> 01:11:49,000
Yeah.

1336
01:11:49,000 --> 01:11:50,000
Yeah.

1337
01:11:50,000 --> 01:11:51,000
Yeah.

1338
01:11:51,000 --> 01:11:52,000
Yeah.

1339
01:11:52,000 --> 01:11:53,000
Yeah.

1340
01:11:53,000 --> 01:11:56,000
I think afterburn you can tweak afterburn a little bit.

1341
01:11:56,000 --> 01:11:57,000
Make it a little more balanced.

1342
01:11:57,000 --> 01:12:00,000
Maybe you'd make it shorter duration but more damage.

1343
01:12:00,000 --> 01:12:06,000
So, like instead of like 10 seconds or whatever it is, make it like 4 or 5 seconds but have it do more damage.

1344
01:12:06,000 --> 01:12:08,000
A little bit more damage.

1345
01:12:08,000 --> 01:12:10,000
It's okay in this current form though.

1346
01:12:10,000 --> 01:12:11,000
I think I don't think it's that.

1347
01:12:11,000 --> 01:12:13,000
It's not that bad.

1348
01:12:13,000 --> 01:12:15,000
Oh, my god.

1349
01:12:15,000 --> 01:12:19,000
Oh, come on, give me over there.

1350
01:12:19,000 --> 01:12:22,000
Oh, you got it.

1351
01:12:22,000 --> 01:12:23,000
Hello.

1352
01:12:23,000 --> 01:12:24,000
Hello, Mr. Medic.

1353
01:12:24,000 --> 01:12:25,000
How are you?

1354
01:12:25,000 --> 01:12:26,000
Oh!

1355
01:12:26,000 --> 01:12:34,000
I like how he just stood there and while we put mines all over him.

1356
01:12:34,000 --> 01:12:35,000
Oh, backstep.

1357
01:12:35,000 --> 01:12:36,000
All right, I'm going to go.

1358
01:12:36,000 --> 01:12:41,000
I'm going to scout for the end here.

1359
01:12:41,000 --> 01:12:48,000
Man, that's just such a difficult game to win.

1360
01:12:48,000 --> 01:12:49,000
Oh, my god.

1361
01:12:49,000 --> 01:12:51,000
But I don't think I've seen you once.

1362
01:12:51,000 --> 01:12:54,000
No, I've been, I keep getting killed by Gemma.

1363
01:12:54,000 --> 01:12:55,000
Stop being so selfish.

1364
01:12:55,000 --> 01:12:58,000
I won't kill this girl.

1365
01:12:58,000 --> 01:13:01,000
Stop being so selfish.

1366
01:13:01,000 --> 01:13:08,000
I just, I mean, I got like, I was like, Octo-heavy, but this like whole thing.

1367
01:13:08,000 --> 01:13:16,000
There's like, two or three medic zombies.

1368
01:13:16,000 --> 01:13:18,000
Not anymore though.

1369
01:13:18,000 --> 01:13:23,000
I'm saying that's the scoot.

1370
01:13:23,000 --> 01:13:24,000
No.

1371
01:13:24,000 --> 01:13:31,000
Oh, he went out this way.

1372
01:13:31,000 --> 01:13:38,000
Oh, where is he?

1373
01:13:38,000 --> 01:13:47,000
Imagine a team of 16 spies all just cloaked, sneak on the point and at the same time all decloat and capture.

1374
01:13:47,000 --> 01:13:54,000
I'm just going to say, imagine that and like they just like pretend that they're the other team.

1375
01:13:54,000 --> 01:13:58,000
Yeah, super spyjack load.

1376
01:13:58,000 --> 01:14:05,000
Super spyjack.

1377
01:14:05,000 --> 01:14:06,000
Oh, no.

1378
01:14:06,000 --> 01:14:11,000
Oh, it's up to me so long to get in fact.

1379
01:14:11,000 --> 01:14:13,000
Oh, man.

1380
01:14:13,000 --> 01:14:17,000
Dude, look at the, there's all the metals.

1381
01:14:17,000 --> 01:14:19,000
That's ridiculous.

1382
01:14:19,000 --> 01:14:22,000
I feel, I want to like switch the blue.

1383
01:14:22,000 --> 01:14:25,000
I can't though.

1384
01:14:25,000 --> 01:14:30,000
Oh my, yeah, the domination like things.

1385
01:14:30,000 --> 01:14:31,000
Nice headshot.

1386
01:14:31,000 --> 01:14:35,000
Sick.

1387
01:14:35,000 --> 01:14:37,000
Come on, blue.

1388
01:14:37,000 --> 01:14:39,000
Oh, stealth.

1389
01:14:39,000 --> 01:14:42,000
Come on, blue man, 61.

1390
01:14:42,000 --> 01:14:49,000
Ready to charge, doctor.

1391
01:14:49,000 --> 01:14:56,000
Oh, they got a big center back there now.

1392
01:14:56,000 --> 01:14:58,000
Tables good turn right now.

1393
01:14:58,000 --> 01:15:01,000
You guys got a good Uber, good push coming.

1394
01:15:01,000 --> 01:15:02,000
Tables coming.

1395
01:15:02,000 --> 01:15:06,000
Not too sure about the Uber.

1396
01:15:06,000 --> 01:15:07,000
Is that Uber charge?

1397
01:15:07,000 --> 01:15:10,000
What are you sure about the push?

1398
01:15:10,000 --> 01:15:12,000
Competence is growing slightly.

1399
01:15:12,000 --> 01:15:17,000
I'm standing in the tunnel not taking damage.

1400
01:15:17,000 --> 01:15:22,000
What about the burger boy?

1401
01:15:22,000 --> 01:15:24,000
Did I hear burger boy?

1402
01:15:24,000 --> 01:15:25,000
I'm not saying.

1403
01:15:25,000 --> 01:15:31,000
I think there's nothing good about this team.

1404
01:15:31,000 --> 01:15:33,000
Oh, burger boy.

1405
01:15:33,000 --> 01:15:35,000
Burger boy.

1406
01:15:35,000 --> 01:15:39,000
There's nothing good.

1407
01:15:40,000 --> 01:15:44,000
Yes, stealth, I lost.

1408
01:15:44,000 --> 01:15:50,000
There's nothing good about this team.

1409
01:15:50,000 --> 01:15:58,000
Oh, that's so funny.

1410
01:15:58,000 --> 01:16:04,000
He's on fire.

1411
01:16:04,000 --> 01:16:06,000
I wish I could hear that.

1412
01:16:06,000 --> 01:16:08,000
But I have my voice chat turned off.

1413
01:16:08,000 --> 01:16:13,000
That would be funny to be able to watch that.

1414
01:16:13,000 --> 01:16:15,000
Burger boy.

1415
01:16:15,000 --> 01:16:18,000
There's nothing good.

1416
01:16:18,000 --> 01:16:25,000
All right, so burger boy, on a scale of 1 to 10, 10 being like you will rip down your house, burn your house down.

1417
01:16:25,000 --> 01:16:28,000
And one being like, I guess I'm like kind of mad.

1418
01:16:28,000 --> 01:16:32,000
How like pissed off are you right now?

1419
01:16:32,000 --> 01:16:35,000
I bet you it's at least a seven or eight.

1420
01:16:35,000 --> 01:16:38,000
Let's be quiet so we can hear his answer.

1421
01:16:38,000 --> 01:16:40,000
I can't hear it.

1422
01:16:40,000 --> 01:16:47,000
So it's going to be really late for me.

1423
01:16:47,000 --> 01:16:50,000
Actually, maybe he's not even listening to the stream.

1424
01:16:50,000 --> 01:16:57,000
No, maybe he forgot I was streaming.

1425
01:16:57,000 --> 01:16:59,000
Oh, they got that.

1426
01:16:59,000 --> 01:17:02,000
Where's that spy right there?

1427
01:17:02,000 --> 01:17:04,000
Oh, my gosh.

1428
01:17:04,000 --> 01:17:06,000
What do you say?

1429
01:17:06,000 --> 01:17:09,000
I'm breaking my fridge.

1430
01:17:09,000 --> 01:17:10,000
Is that what he thought?

1431
01:17:10,000 --> 01:17:11,000
Damn it.

1432
01:17:11,000 --> 01:17:13,000
I wish I could have my...

1433
01:17:13,000 --> 01:17:15,000
I need to turn it on.

1434
01:17:15,000 --> 01:17:17,000
Hold on.

1435
01:17:17,000 --> 01:17:19,000
Oh, my God.

1436
01:17:19,000 --> 01:17:20,000
All right.

1437
01:17:20,000 --> 01:17:21,000
You can tell him to do it again.

1438
01:17:21,000 --> 01:17:28,000
Burger boy, do it again.

1439
01:17:28,000 --> 01:17:33,000
Burger boy, rage again.

1440
01:17:33,000 --> 01:17:37,000
Is he going to do it?

1441
01:17:37,000 --> 01:17:39,000
Oh, he's not like actually mad.

1442
01:17:39,000 --> 01:17:48,000
I wish I caught that on video.

1443
01:17:48,000 --> 01:17:50,000
Oh, you're losing, burger boy.

1444
01:17:50,000 --> 01:17:52,000
It's over.

1445
01:17:52,000 --> 01:17:54,000
Oh, look, it's all over.

1446
01:17:54,000 --> 01:17:55,000
Let's see what he says.

1447
01:17:55,000 --> 01:17:56,000
Hold on.

1448
01:17:56,000 --> 01:17:57,000
Here it comes.

1449
01:17:57,000 --> 01:17:59,000
Oh, what are you saying about that, burger boy?

1450
01:17:59,000 --> 01:18:00,000
Why are you talking to him?

1451
01:18:00,000 --> 01:18:02,000
Oh, I want to...

1452
01:18:02,000 --> 01:18:03,000
He's your friend.

1453
01:18:03,000 --> 01:18:06,000
No, I want him to like flip up.

1454
01:18:06,000 --> 01:18:08,000
He's silent.

1455
01:18:08,000 --> 01:18:10,000
He's your friend.

1456
01:18:10,000 --> 01:18:12,000
Yeah, but I...

1457
01:18:12,000 --> 01:18:13,000
Did he?

1458
01:18:13,000 --> 01:18:14,000
No, he's still here.

1459
01:18:14,000 --> 01:18:15,000
No, he's not.

1460
01:18:15,000 --> 01:18:17,000
Yeah, he is.

1461
01:18:17,000 --> 01:18:18,000
All right.

1462
01:18:18,000 --> 01:18:22,000
I'm going to transition to CSGO.

1463
01:18:22,000 --> 01:18:24,000
Thanks for coming.

1464
01:18:24,000 --> 01:18:26,000
No, you're not allowed to come.

1465
01:18:26,000 --> 01:18:28,000
Oh.

1466
01:18:28,000 --> 01:18:34,000
Very good boy.

1467
01:18:34,000 --> 01:18:36,000
This is perfect.

1468
01:18:36,000 --> 01:18:42,000
There's nothing good about this.

1469
01:18:42,000 --> 01:18:50,000
Let me try and figure out how to do CSGO.

1470
01:18:50,000 --> 01:18:53,000
Could it be sort of difficult?

1471
01:18:53,000 --> 01:18:55,000
I'm going to do windowed mode.

1472
01:18:55,000 --> 01:18:57,000
It's going to take maybe a few seconds.

1473
01:18:57,000 --> 01:18:59,000
Give me a minute, guys.

1474
01:18:59,000 --> 01:19:04,000
Counter-strike, global effects.

1475
01:19:04,000 --> 01:19:05,000
All right.

1476
01:19:05,000 --> 01:19:08,000
Screen's going to go black for 20 to 30 seconds.

1477
01:19:08,000 --> 01:19:10,000
I'm still here.

1478
01:19:10,000 --> 01:19:12,000
Don't worry.

1479
01:19:12,000 --> 01:19:14,000
Oh, no, black screen.

1480
01:19:14,000 --> 01:19:17,000
Oh!

1481
01:19:17,000 --> 01:19:18,000
What do we do?

1482
01:19:18,000 --> 01:19:21,000
It's a black screen.

1483
01:19:21,000 --> 01:19:23,000
Oh, burger boy.

1484
01:19:23,000 --> 01:19:25,000
You're listening right now?

1485
01:19:25,000 --> 01:19:29,000
After we play this for like 20 to 30 minutes, we're going to McDonald's.

1486
01:19:29,000 --> 01:19:31,000
We're going to get double cheeseburgers.

1487
01:19:31,000 --> 01:19:35,000
I hope you know that.

1488
01:19:35,000 --> 01:19:37,000
Video settings.

1489
01:19:37,000 --> 01:19:42,000
We are going to be playing in windowed.

1490
01:19:42,000 --> 01:19:45,000
And 1280 by 721.

1491
01:19:45,000 --> 01:19:48,000
I think I'm going to go and play Call of Duty 4.

1492
01:19:48,000 --> 01:19:52,000
I'll probably jump out the chat, but I'll still listen to the stream.

1493
01:19:52,000 --> 01:19:54,000
Okay. That's cool.

1494
01:19:54,000 --> 01:19:56,000
All right. Thanks for coming, dude.

1495
01:19:56,000 --> 01:19:58,000
Can you talk about you, then?

1496
01:19:58,000 --> 01:20:02,000
Yeah, I know what you're saying at all times, stealth.

1497
01:20:02,000 --> 01:20:04,000
Bomber.

1498
01:20:04,000 --> 01:20:06,000
All right.

1499
01:20:06,000 --> 01:20:08,000
If you're back later on Happy Days.

1500
01:20:08,000 --> 01:20:10,000
Enjoy CSGO.

1501
01:20:10,000 --> 01:20:12,000
Thanks for coming, boo.

1502
01:20:12,000 --> 01:20:14,000
Thank you.

1503
01:20:14,000 --> 01:20:16,000
Bye, boo.

1504
01:20:16,000 --> 01:20:20,000
So we're going to play some CSGO.

1505
01:20:20,000 --> 01:20:24,000
We're going to play some gun game.

1506
01:20:24,000 --> 01:20:28,000
And if you have this, you're more than welcome to try and join in off of me.

1507
01:20:28,000 --> 01:20:30,000
Or if stealth is appearing online him.

1508
01:20:30,000 --> 01:20:32,000
It's going to be difficult to join in on these.

1509
01:20:32,000 --> 01:20:38,000
It's going to be kind of difficult to get everyone in the game because it's um.

1510
01:20:38,000 --> 01:20:43,000
Wait, Valve confirms that Meet the Pyro is already done and ready?

1511
01:20:43,000 --> 01:20:45,000
Holy crap.

1512
01:20:46,000 --> 01:20:49,000
That means we're going to get it soon.

1513
01:20:49,000 --> 01:20:51,000
Almost we don't.

1514
01:20:51,000 --> 01:20:55,000
Unless it doesn't happen. Yeah, at least we don't get it.

1515
01:20:55,000 --> 01:21:02,000
It's already released. Cutting someone like sneak like I would steal that if I like work for Valve and put it on the internet.

1516
01:21:02,000 --> 01:21:08,000
And then I get fired for a long time.

1517
01:21:08,000 --> 01:21:12,000
Yeah, you probably would get fired. That would not be good.

1518
01:21:12,000 --> 01:21:21,000
Oh, you can, you guys can hardly, they're quiet. Are they still quiet?

1519
01:21:21,000 --> 01:21:23,000
Who, they like me.

1520
01:21:23,000 --> 01:21:27,000
Apparently you guys are quiet. I don't know why.

1521
01:21:27,000 --> 01:21:30,000
I just try to turn you out.

1522
01:21:30,000 --> 01:21:32,000
That's odd.

1523
01:21:32,000 --> 01:21:39,000
So this is gun game. This is like legit like gun game.

1524
01:21:39,000 --> 01:21:45,000
Was it like that the whole time? Was it like that just for when I changed it over?

1525
01:21:45,000 --> 01:21:55,000
Was it like that during TF2 as well?

1526
01:21:55,000 --> 01:22:04,000
Oh, gun game.

1527
01:22:05,000 --> 01:22:10,000
Oh, so they were both low really really low for the team for us.

1528
01:22:10,000 --> 01:22:14,000
Oh, just at the end there.

1529
01:22:14,000 --> 01:22:16,000
That's weird.

1530
01:22:16,000 --> 01:22:17,000
The whole time?

1531
01:22:17,000 --> 01:22:21,000
No, someone they were saying at the end of team fortress two probably when I transitioned over.

1532
01:22:21,000 --> 01:22:23,000
Oh.

1533
01:22:23,000 --> 01:22:27,000
Yeah, so this is the gun game. This is my favorite thing about this game.

1534
01:22:27,000 --> 01:22:29,000
I love gun game.

1535
01:22:29,000 --> 01:22:32,000
I can't handle the game.

1536
01:22:35,000 --> 01:22:43,000
Thanks for the feedback guys. I appreciate it because I try to, it's hard to make it sometimes explode is weird and they just lower the volume of everybody.

1537
01:22:43,000 --> 01:22:52,000
I don't know why, but so thanks for thanks for being here to be able to tell me what's going on.

1538
01:22:52,000 --> 01:22:58,000
So if you don't know what this is every time you get a kill every single time you kill somebody you get you get a different gun.

1539
01:22:58,000 --> 01:23:02,000
And I think it's 26 or 27 kills.

1540
01:23:02,000 --> 01:23:09,000
I don't see stuff as the worst counter strike play ever.

1541
01:23:09,000 --> 01:23:15,000
Oh, I must have it too in general.

1542
01:23:15,000 --> 01:23:20,000
No, audience fine.

1543
01:23:20,000 --> 01:23:25,000
Oh no, I'm not personajes still going to be.

1544
01:23:25,000 --> 01:23:28,000
That's off of his prime. Optimus prime.

1545
01:23:28,000 --> 01:23:34,000
Oh, he's dead.

1546
01:23:34,000 --> 01:23:35,000
Oh, I'm going to get behind.

1547
01:23:35,000 --> 01:23:37,000
Oh, damn it.

1548
01:23:37,000 --> 01:23:39,000
This is still in beta.

1549
01:23:39,000 --> 01:23:42,000
So as you see, when I kill somebody else here, if I can show you.

1550
01:23:42,000 --> 01:23:46,000
Right when I kill somebody, the instant I do it, I'm going to switch a gun.

1551
01:23:46,000 --> 01:23:49,000
It's going to go to something else.

1552
01:23:49,000 --> 01:23:54,000
This is the like shot gun type thing.

1553
01:23:54,000 --> 01:24:01,000
I'd love to show them that example too, but I can't get a kill to switch my gun.

1554
01:24:01,000 --> 01:24:04,000
Hey, well, you're not really on the screen.

1555
01:24:04,000 --> 01:24:08,000
Why was just saying.

1556
01:24:08,000 --> 01:24:10,000
Yeah, where this is PC.

1557
01:24:10,000 --> 01:24:13,000
I don't know, this is not really even getting developed right now for consoles.

1558
01:24:13,000 --> 01:24:14,000
I think they're doing that later.

1559
01:24:14,000 --> 01:24:17,000
I think it's actually code developed for five.

1560
01:24:17,000 --> 01:24:18,000
I could be totally wrong.

1561
01:24:18,000 --> 01:24:21,000
I'm not sure on that.

1562
01:24:21,000 --> 01:24:31,000
Well, that's how you missed three times point blank.

1563
01:24:31,000 --> 01:24:32,000
Well, that was the auto shotgun.

1564
01:24:32,000 --> 01:24:34,000
Somebody's already reached knife level.

1565
01:24:34,000 --> 01:24:39,000
So once you go through all the guns, once you get like 27 kills, you use a knife.

1566
01:24:39,000 --> 01:24:40,000
And you have to knife somebody.

1567
01:24:40,000 --> 01:24:43,000
And if you knife them, the game's over and you win.

1568
01:24:43,000 --> 01:24:49,000
Well, whatever team had the person knife thing.

1569
01:24:49,000 --> 01:24:56,000
Thanks.

1570
01:24:56,000 --> 01:24:58,000
Come on, keep it going.

1571
01:24:58,000 --> 01:25:00,000
Oh, that's game.

1572
01:25:00,000 --> 01:25:02,000
Oh, somebody wants.

1573
01:25:02,000 --> 01:25:04,000
Where's MLC still?

1574
01:25:04,000 --> 01:25:07,000
Oh, at the bottom of the ligabord.

1575
01:25:07,000 --> 01:25:10,000
Yeah, this is definitely the best mode in Counter Strike.

1576
01:25:10,000 --> 01:25:11,000
No, in my opinion.

1577
01:25:11,000 --> 01:25:14,000
It used to be a mod, then they made it like an actual game mode.

1578
01:25:14,000 --> 01:25:16,000
It's so fun.

1579
01:25:16,000 --> 01:25:17,000
Hey, what's the enemy going?

1580
01:25:17,000 --> 01:25:19,000
Go CT.

1581
01:25:19,000 --> 01:25:21,000
What up, what a deliq?

1582
01:25:21,000 --> 01:25:24,000
Yeah, I mean, the stream's been going for like an hour and a half now.

1583
01:25:24,000 --> 01:25:26,000
So if some of you guys got to go, you got to go.

1584
01:25:26,000 --> 01:25:27,000
Thanks for coming.

1585
01:25:27,000 --> 01:25:28,000
Appreciate it.

1586
01:25:28,000 --> 01:25:29,000
Oh, I love this map.

1587
01:25:29,000 --> 01:25:30,000
I love this map.

1588
01:25:30,000 --> 01:25:32,000
This is the map shibi was like losing his mind on.

1589
01:25:32,000 --> 01:25:35,000
There's only two maps on this one.

1590
01:25:35,000 --> 01:25:36,000
Oh, that's right. There is only two maps.

1591
01:25:36,000 --> 01:25:37,000
What?

1592
01:25:37,000 --> 01:25:43,000
Damn it.

1593
01:25:43,000 --> 01:25:45,000
Oh, no bullets.

1594
01:25:45,000 --> 01:25:47,000
Wait, did there used to be a map?

1595
01:25:47,000 --> 01:25:48,000
Huh?

1596
01:25:48,000 --> 01:25:50,000
There is.

1597
01:25:50,000 --> 01:25:51,000
Where?

1598
01:25:51,000 --> 01:25:52,000
It's in the top left.

1599
01:25:52,000 --> 01:25:53,000
We talked about it.

1600
01:25:53,000 --> 01:25:55,000
Oh, because there's nothing up there for me.

1601
01:25:55,000 --> 01:25:57,000
Oh, well, you must have been glitching out.

1602
01:25:57,000 --> 01:25:58,000
Oh, there it is.

1603
01:25:58,000 --> 01:26:00,000
It just came out there, Dad.

1604
01:26:00,000 --> 01:26:04,000
Oh, I got a headshot from across the map.

1605
01:26:04,000 --> 01:26:06,000
Oh, I'm going to make a ton of hits and packs, man.

1606
01:26:06,000 --> 01:26:08,000
It's going to be me and Paxies.

1607
01:26:08,000 --> 01:26:10,000
They're going to be best friends when it comes to videos.

1608
01:26:10,000 --> 01:26:11,000
Damn it.

1609
01:26:11,000 --> 01:26:12,000
I'm in trouble.

1610
01:26:16,000 --> 01:26:18,000
No, run in the boards.

1611
01:26:22,000 --> 01:26:24,000
Burger boy has a YouTube channel.

1612
01:26:24,000 --> 01:26:29,000
His first video is going to be going up in like probably like 15 months.

1613
01:26:37,000 --> 01:26:38,000
Show yourself.

1614
01:26:43,000 --> 01:26:44,000
Damn it.

1615
01:26:45,000 --> 01:26:47,000
I got to get a good stream together.

1616
01:26:51,000 --> 01:26:52,000
Oh, come on.

1617
01:26:54,000 --> 01:26:55,000
Damn.

1618
01:27:03,000 --> 01:27:06,000
I hear these people in the chat saying like this game of sucks.

1619
01:27:06,000 --> 01:27:07,000
No way.

1620
01:27:07,000 --> 01:27:11,000
This game, this is the most fun game mode on CS.

1621
01:27:12,000 --> 01:27:14,000
Oh, what are teammates here, Sam?

1622
01:27:14,000 --> 01:27:16,000
Oh, really?

1623
01:27:17,000 --> 01:27:20,000
Dad, is Goomba Stomp that guy?

1624
01:27:20,000 --> 01:27:22,000
I don't think I did.

1625
01:27:22,000 --> 01:27:24,000
We had that conversation last night.

1626
01:27:24,000 --> 01:27:25,000
We were like, can you goomba Stomp?

1627
01:27:25,000 --> 01:27:26,000
What's going on here?

1628
01:27:27,000 --> 01:27:30,000
Because I said I like damage with teammate when I land on top of them.

1629
01:27:30,000 --> 01:27:31,000
Oh, my God.

1630
01:27:31,000 --> 01:27:32,000
I can't believe it.

1631
01:27:34,000 --> 01:27:36,000
How many bullets does it take?

1632
01:27:37,000 --> 01:27:38,000
Damn.

1633
01:27:39,000 --> 01:27:42,000
My favorite gun in CS go is probably the shotgun.

1634
01:27:42,000 --> 01:27:43,000
He just regular shotgun.

1635
01:27:43,000 --> 01:27:44,000
I love that thing.

1636
01:27:47,000 --> 01:27:48,000
Oh, come on.

1637
01:27:49,000 --> 01:27:50,000
This thing.

1638
01:27:50,000 --> 01:27:52,000
This is my favorite gun in CS right now.

1639
01:27:52,000 --> 01:27:53,000
I love this thing.

1640
01:27:53,000 --> 01:27:56,000
Unfortunately, when I get one killed, it's going away.

1641
01:28:00,000 --> 01:28:01,000
Oh, I see it's gone.

1642
01:28:01,000 --> 01:28:02,000
I see it's gone.

1643
01:28:02,000 --> 01:28:03,000
I see it's gone.

1644
01:28:04,000 --> 01:28:06,000
I don't know how you get kills in this.

1645
01:28:06,000 --> 01:28:08,000
No one dies when I shoot him.

1646
01:28:08,000 --> 01:28:09,000
Is the auto shotty?

1647
01:28:09,000 --> 01:28:10,000
Damn it.

1648
01:28:12,000 --> 01:28:13,000
P90 is awesome too.

1649
01:28:13,000 --> 01:28:15,000
Everything is pretty balanced in this game.

1650
01:28:15,000 --> 01:28:17,000
There's way too many of them over there.

1651
01:28:17,000 --> 01:28:19,000
No way I was going to do that.

1652
01:28:22,000 --> 01:28:24,000
I'm the worst counter shot.

1653
01:28:24,000 --> 01:28:26,000
I'm the worst counter shot.

1654
01:28:26,000 --> 01:28:28,000
I'm the worst counter shot.

1655
01:28:28,000 --> 01:28:30,000
I'm the worst counter shot.

1656
01:28:30,000 --> 01:28:32,000
I'm the worst counter shot.

1657
01:28:32,000 --> 01:28:34,000
I'm the worst counter shot player.

1658
01:28:35,000 --> 01:28:37,000
I literally don't think.

1659
01:28:37,000 --> 01:28:38,000
It's a worse one.

1660
01:28:38,000 --> 01:28:40,000
You know, it's tough playing this game in a window.

1661
01:28:40,000 --> 01:28:42,000
It is very hard to do this.

1662
01:28:42,000 --> 01:28:44,000
My hand looks so tiny.

1663
01:28:44,000 --> 01:28:46,000
It's like, yeah, I'm a little baby.

1664
01:28:47,000 --> 01:28:49,000
I can't believe I didn't kill him.

1665
01:28:55,000 --> 01:28:56,000
Do I like pretzels?

1666
01:28:56,000 --> 01:28:57,000
I love pretzels.

1667
01:28:57,000 --> 01:28:59,000
World gold, baby.

1668
01:28:59,000 --> 01:29:01,000
I'm doing absolutely terrible right now.

1669
01:29:01,000 --> 01:29:02,000
Terrible.

1670
01:29:04,000 --> 01:29:06,000
I wish I could full screen this.

1671
01:29:06,000 --> 01:29:07,000
Alright, exploit.

1672
01:29:07,000 --> 01:29:09,000
Make it so I can full screen my game.

1673
01:29:14,000 --> 01:29:15,000
First problem.

1674
01:29:15,000 --> 01:29:16,000
There's no hats.

1675
01:29:16,000 --> 01:29:17,000
Second problem.

1676
01:29:17,000 --> 01:29:18,000
No hats.

1677
01:29:18,000 --> 01:29:19,000
Third problem.

1678
01:29:19,000 --> 01:29:20,000
No lasers.

1679
01:29:20,000 --> 01:29:22,000
I'm a fourth problem.

1680
01:29:32,000 --> 01:29:33,000
Oh my gosh.

1681
01:29:33,000 --> 01:29:34,000
That killed me.

1682
01:29:34,000 --> 01:29:35,000
Sorry.

1683
01:29:35,000 --> 01:29:37,000
I got already on the light machine gun.

1684
01:29:40,000 --> 01:29:41,000
Yeah.

1685
01:29:41,000 --> 01:29:43,000
I was doing pretty well last night.

1686
01:29:44,000 --> 01:29:46,000
Oh, that game begins already over.

1687
01:29:46,000 --> 01:29:47,000
No!

1688
01:29:49,000 --> 01:29:50,000
Jeez.

1689
01:29:50,000 --> 01:29:51,000
I have a...

1690
01:29:51,000 --> 01:29:52,000
Yeah.

1691
01:29:52,000 --> 01:29:54,000
That's Alex, I know.

1692
01:29:55,000 --> 01:29:56,000
I'm just saying.

1693
01:29:56,000 --> 01:29:57,000
Are there any vases in there?

1694
01:29:57,000 --> 01:29:58,000
He's in the...

1695
01:29:58,000 --> 01:30:00,000
Yeah, where is he?

1696
01:30:00,000 --> 01:30:02,000
Why is he not a mod?

1697
01:30:02,000 --> 01:30:03,000
That doesn't make any sense.

1698
01:30:03,000 --> 01:30:06,000
We don't we don't trust him after I would have...

1699
01:30:06,000 --> 01:30:07,000
After what happened?

1700
01:30:07,000 --> 01:30:08,000
I'm gonna go T.

1701
01:30:08,000 --> 01:30:09,000
Go T. Go Tarris.

1702
01:30:11,000 --> 01:30:13,000
After he got into the cookie jar.

1703
01:30:18,000 --> 01:30:19,000
Oh, are you really?

1704
01:30:19,000 --> 01:30:21,000
Well, I'm a moron.

1705
01:30:24,000 --> 01:30:26,000
No, I'm not shooting my own teammates now.

1706
01:30:26,000 --> 01:30:29,000
Oh, I thought I was gonna get him.

1707
01:30:29,000 --> 01:30:31,000
I got to get in Tri-Hard mode now.

1708
01:30:31,000 --> 01:30:33,000
I want to get a good game.

1709
01:30:37,000 --> 01:30:39,000
Tri-Hard mode.

1710
01:30:39,000 --> 01:30:41,000
Activate.

1711
01:30:43,000 --> 01:30:44,000
3 and 2.

1712
01:30:44,000 --> 01:30:45,000
Let's go.

1713
01:30:45,000 --> 01:30:47,000
I want to be at least one to two.

1714
01:30:49,000 --> 01:30:51,000
Oh, I didn't kill him.

1715
01:30:51,000 --> 01:30:52,000
What?

1716
01:30:57,000 --> 01:30:59,000
Gotta get that gun game.

1717
01:30:59,000 --> 01:31:01,000
Gotta get that gun game up.

1718
01:31:01,000 --> 01:31:02,000
I didn't even see that guy.

1719
01:31:02,000 --> 01:31:05,000
I got like blended in with the background.

1720
01:31:11,000 --> 01:31:12,000
Let's go.

1721
01:31:12,000 --> 01:31:13,000
I'll keep it moving.

1722
01:31:13,000 --> 01:31:14,000
Keep it moving there.

1723
01:31:14,000 --> 01:31:15,000
Keep it moving.

1724
01:31:17,000 --> 01:31:20,000
Okay, I literally think I'm doing 99% damage to people

1725
01:31:20,000 --> 01:31:23,000
and then other people are just taking the last shot.

1726
01:31:23,000 --> 01:31:25,000
I'm just gonna get a good game.

1727
01:31:25,000 --> 01:31:27,000
I'm gonna get a good game.

1728
01:31:27,000 --> 01:31:28,000
Oh, LL Cool J in here.

1729
01:31:28,000 --> 01:31:29,000
I can speak up on him.

1730
01:31:33,000 --> 01:31:34,000
There we go.

1731
01:31:34,000 --> 01:31:35,000
There we go.

1732
01:31:37,000 --> 01:31:38,000
That's what I'm talking about.

1733
01:31:38,000 --> 01:31:39,000
Now we're going.

1734
01:31:39,000 --> 01:31:40,000
Now we're going.

1735
01:31:40,000 --> 01:31:41,000
Now we're going strong.

1736
01:31:45,000 --> 01:31:46,000
Sting.

1737
01:31:53,000 --> 01:31:54,000
Keep it moving.

1738
01:31:54,000 --> 01:31:55,000
Keep it moving here.

1739
01:31:55,000 --> 01:31:56,000
Keep it moving.

1740
01:31:56,000 --> 01:31:57,000
Oh!

1741
01:31:59,000 --> 01:32:00,000
Eggs.

1742
01:32:01,000 --> 01:32:03,000
I got to try hard like an egg.

1743
01:32:03,000 --> 01:32:04,000
Sure, man.

1744
01:32:04,000 --> 01:32:05,000
How do you have 14 freaking points?

1745
01:32:05,000 --> 01:32:06,000
I went into try hard, boy.

1746
01:32:06,000 --> 01:32:07,000
Didn't I tell you?

1747
01:32:10,000 --> 01:32:11,000
There we go.

1748
01:32:13,000 --> 01:32:15,000
I'm not messing around anymore.

1749
01:32:17,000 --> 01:32:19,000
No more messing around, dude.

1750
01:32:20,000 --> 01:32:22,000
Let's go this way.

1751
01:32:23,000 --> 01:32:24,000
Sniper rifle.

1752
01:32:24,000 --> 01:32:25,000
Let's get one.

1753
01:32:25,000 --> 01:32:26,000
Hey!

1754
01:32:26,000 --> 01:32:27,000
Shabu!

1755
01:32:28,000 --> 01:32:29,000
Where is it?

1756
01:32:31,000 --> 01:32:32,000
Ah!

1757
01:32:34,000 --> 01:32:35,000
18 and 8.

1758
01:32:35,000 --> 01:32:36,000
Come on.

1759
01:32:36,000 --> 01:32:38,000
Give me like 10 more kills in a row, baby.

1760
01:32:39,000 --> 01:32:42,000
I'll be careful with this light machine gun, dude.

1761
01:32:44,000 --> 01:32:45,000
Oh, that was...

1762
01:32:45,000 --> 01:32:46,000
That was him killing.

1763
01:32:50,000 --> 01:32:51,000
Ah!

1764
01:32:52,000 --> 01:32:53,000
Ah!

1765
01:32:53,000 --> 01:32:54,000
Come on.

1766
01:32:58,000 --> 01:33:00,000
It's high when you get to the pistols, it gets difficult.

1767
01:33:00,000 --> 01:33:02,000
This is where it gets really difficult.

1768
01:33:02,000 --> 01:33:05,000
It gets difficult when you're using any gun in this.

1769
01:33:05,000 --> 01:33:06,000
Haha.

1770
01:33:06,000 --> 01:33:07,000
God.

1771
01:33:08,000 --> 01:33:10,000
Now let's see what I got.

1772
01:33:13,000 --> 01:33:15,000
Trying to pull off a headshot.

1773
01:33:15,000 --> 01:33:16,000
Not going to happen.

1774
01:33:17,000 --> 01:33:18,000
I just...

1775
01:33:24,000 --> 01:33:25,000
Oh, come on now.

1776
01:33:25,000 --> 01:33:26,000
Come on now.

1777
01:33:27,000 --> 01:33:29,000
Oh, come on now, baby.

1778
01:33:31,000 --> 01:33:32,000
Ah! I had it.

1779
01:33:32,000 --> 01:33:33,000
I had it.

1780
01:33:33,000 --> 01:33:34,000
Come on.

1781
01:33:34,000 --> 01:33:35,000
Let me win this round.

1782
01:33:36,000 --> 01:33:37,000
Ah, damn it.

1783
01:33:41,000 --> 01:33:42,000
Nope.

1784
01:33:43,000 --> 01:33:44,000
Crap.

1785
01:33:44,000 --> 01:33:46,000
Crap in my pants.

1786
01:33:49,000 --> 01:33:51,000
No, this is not good.

1787
01:33:51,000 --> 01:33:52,000
I got to find the way around.

1788
01:33:53,000 --> 01:33:54,000
Damn it.

1789
01:33:55,000 --> 01:33:56,000
Alright, I'm going to...

1790
01:33:56,000 --> 01:33:57,000
Someone over here.

1791
01:33:59,000 --> 01:34:01,000
Oh, I can't believe that it had been the face.

1792
01:34:01,000 --> 01:34:03,000
Losing it now, I'm losing it.

1793
01:34:04,000 --> 01:34:05,000
I had it.

1794
01:34:05,000 --> 01:34:07,000
I had it for a little bit.

1795
01:34:08,000 --> 01:34:10,000
No, ah, I'm going to lose it.

1796
01:34:11,000 --> 01:34:12,000
I got to lose it.

1797
01:34:12,000 --> 01:34:13,000
I was so far ahead.

1798
01:34:20,000 --> 01:34:22,000
Ah, I got to take off somebody.

1799
01:34:22,000 --> 01:34:23,000
No one this way, man.

1800
01:34:28,000 --> 01:34:29,000
Here we go.

1801
01:34:29,000 --> 01:34:31,000
Finally got out of that stupid pistol.

1802
01:34:31,000 --> 01:34:33,000
Now I got the duel, but red is good.

1803
01:34:35,000 --> 01:34:36,000
Oh, this guy.

1804
01:34:36,000 --> 01:34:37,000
I'm going to make this guy's day bad.

1805
01:34:37,000 --> 01:34:38,000
This egg over here.

1806
01:34:39,000 --> 01:34:40,000
Where would this egg go?

1807
01:34:41,000 --> 01:34:43,000
I just had a clean shot on that egg.

1808
01:34:46,000 --> 01:34:48,000
Oh, my God, I can't believe I didn't get it.

1809
01:34:48,000 --> 01:34:49,000
Do I?

1810
01:34:49,000 --> 01:34:50,000
That was a lucky spawn.

1811
01:34:53,000 --> 01:34:54,000
Did I get it?

1812
01:34:54,000 --> 01:34:55,000
Oh, the game.

1813
01:34:55,000 --> 01:34:56,000
Yeah.

1814
01:34:56,000 --> 01:34:57,000
I did it.

1815
01:34:58,000 --> 01:34:59,000
Oh, I can't believe it.

1816
01:35:00,000 --> 01:35:02,000
I can't believe I won the game.

1817
01:35:04,000 --> 01:35:06,000
That's the first time I've ever had a game so hard.

1818
01:35:11,000 --> 01:35:13,000
Alright, let's take them rage Quinn.

1819
01:35:15,000 --> 01:35:17,000
Yeah, that's the first time I've ever done that.

1820
01:35:17,000 --> 01:35:18,000
Wow.

1821
01:35:19,000 --> 01:35:21,000
That was a, I wish I was like, fire.

1822
01:35:21,000 --> 01:35:23,000
I wish I was like recording that.

1823
01:35:24,000 --> 01:35:26,000
Because it's probably not going to happen again.

1824
01:35:26,000 --> 01:35:28,000
Oh, you got a word of the coordinates.

1825
01:35:30,000 --> 01:35:32,000
Um, I own battlefield three.

1826
01:35:32,000 --> 01:35:36,000
So do not, you don't, please do not get battlefield three.

1827
01:35:37,000 --> 01:35:39,000
I appreciate the gesture though.

1828
01:35:39,000 --> 01:35:42,000
Like, thank you so much for even considering doing that.

1829
01:35:42,000 --> 01:35:44,000
But I have battlefield three.

1830
01:35:46,000 --> 01:35:48,000
Oh, Boo, did you see, I just wanted to see.

1831
01:35:49,000 --> 01:35:50,000
That was for you.

1832
01:35:58,000 --> 01:36:01,000
Yeah, but I'm not, I don't, it's going to be 360.

1833
01:36:01,000 --> 01:36:02,000
I guess I could use it.

1834
01:36:02,000 --> 01:36:03,000
I could use that.

1835
01:36:07,000 --> 01:36:08,000
Oh, you bastard.

1836
01:36:08,000 --> 01:36:09,000
Optimus Prime.

1837
01:36:09,000 --> 01:36:10,000
Hey, what do you know?

1838
01:36:10,000 --> 01:36:13,000
Optimus Prime has the knife in this game and he's wicked good with it.

1839
01:36:15,000 --> 01:36:16,000
Coincidence?

1840
01:36:16,000 --> 01:36:17,000
I don't think so.

1841
01:36:31,000 --> 01:36:32,000
Give me that head shot.

1842
01:36:32,000 --> 01:36:33,000
Give me that head shot.

1843
01:36:37,000 --> 01:36:38,000
Oh, no.

1844
01:36:42,000 --> 01:36:43,000
Boo.

1845
01:36:43,000 --> 01:36:46,000
All right. I, I, I quit the game.

1846
01:36:46,000 --> 01:36:47,000
You left?

1847
01:36:47,000 --> 01:36:49,000
Optimus Prime is pissing me off.

1848
01:36:51,000 --> 01:36:53,000
Oh, I guess he's wicked good.

1849
01:36:53,000 --> 01:36:54,000
Yep.

1850
01:36:57,000 --> 01:36:59,000
Counter strike source.

1851
01:36:59,000 --> 01:37:00,000
Did I say source?

1852
01:37:00,000 --> 01:37:01,000
I met counter strike.

1853
01:37:01,000 --> 01:37:02,000
Go.

1854
01:37:03,000 --> 01:37:04,000
Stealth can't take it.

1855
01:37:06,000 --> 01:37:07,000
Oh, jump down.

1856
01:37:16,000 --> 01:37:18,000
I was doing all right in the beginning.

1857
01:37:19,000 --> 01:37:20,000
I was doing all right.

1858
01:37:21,000 --> 01:37:23,000
See if I can come back to life here.

1859
01:37:24,000 --> 01:37:25,000
What?

1860
01:37:25,000 --> 01:37:27,000
How does that make any sense?

1861
01:37:33,000 --> 01:37:34,000
How, I killed that guy.

1862
01:37:35,000 --> 01:37:36,000
Did I shoot him through the grate?

1863
01:37:36,000 --> 01:37:37,000
Now the hell did that happen?

1864
01:37:40,000 --> 01:37:42,000
Yeah, I'm not sure how much money it'll be.

1865
01:37:42,000 --> 01:37:44,000
I, I was assuming it won't be more than 50 bucks.

1866
01:37:44,000 --> 01:37:46,000
It probably won't be more than 40.

1867
01:37:48,000 --> 01:37:52,000
I bet you it's, I'm going to say 30 bucks.

1868
01:37:52,000 --> 01:37:53,000
That's my prediction.

1869
01:37:56,000 --> 01:37:57,000
Again, I could be totally wrong.

1870
01:37:57,000 --> 01:38:00,000
It really depends on what kind of strategy they want to go for.

1871
01:38:05,000 --> 01:38:06,000
Nope.

1872
01:38:07,000 --> 01:38:08,000
16.

1873
01:38:15,000 --> 01:38:16,000
Damn it.

1874
01:38:18,000 --> 01:38:19,000
Stop killing people.

1875
01:38:19,000 --> 01:38:21,000
I can't see what gun you have.

1876
01:38:24,000 --> 01:38:25,000
This is going to be tough sniper.

1877
01:38:25,000 --> 01:38:26,000
You have to like cool.

1878
01:38:26,000 --> 01:38:29,000
I have to like call a duty quick scope somebody.

1879
01:38:35,000 --> 01:38:37,000
Where'd he go? Where'd he go?

1880
01:38:42,000 --> 01:38:43,000
How did I not hit him?

1881
01:38:43,000 --> 01:38:44,000
Here we go.

1882
01:38:47,000 --> 01:38:49,000
LMG. Is that the real burger boy?

1883
01:38:50,000 --> 01:38:51,000
We better believe it.

1884
01:38:56,000 --> 01:38:58,000
You better believe it.

1885
01:39:05,000 --> 01:39:07,000
Oh, Greg.

1886
01:39:07,000 --> 01:39:08,000
Oh, that's a bot.

1887
01:39:09,000 --> 01:39:10,000
Bot Greg.

1888
01:39:19,000 --> 01:39:20,000
Come on, I'm at the pistol level.

1889
01:39:24,000 --> 01:39:25,000
Come on, this is a bot.

1890
01:39:25,000 --> 01:39:27,000
Come on, this is a damn...

1891
01:39:35,000 --> 01:39:36,000
Damn it.

1892
01:39:45,000 --> 01:39:47,000
22, somebody's already at the knife level.

1893
01:39:47,000 --> 01:39:48,000
It might end right now.

1894
01:39:50,000 --> 01:39:51,000
Nah, it's over.

1895
01:39:52,000 --> 01:39:53,000
It is over.

1896
01:39:53,000 --> 01:39:55,000
The TKO.

1897
01:39:55,000 --> 01:39:57,000
I believe he's the one that got it.

1898
01:39:57,000 --> 01:39:58,000
Good game.

1899
01:40:01,000 --> 01:40:02,000
Oh.

1900
01:40:02,000 --> 01:40:04,000
I think I'm going to hop out of CS.

1901
01:40:05,000 --> 01:40:07,000
I just wanted to play.

1902
01:40:07,000 --> 01:40:09,000
I'm probably going to use that gameplay.

1903
01:40:10,000 --> 01:40:13,000
I might actually use that one that I went ham on.

1904
01:40:14,000 --> 01:40:15,000
Ham.

1905
01:40:15,000 --> 01:40:16,000
I got a ham sandwich.

1906
01:40:17,000 --> 01:40:19,000
A ham hamburger.

1907
01:40:19,000 --> 01:40:20,000
Oh, you're still here?

1908
01:40:20,000 --> 01:40:21,000
Me.

1909
01:40:21,000 --> 01:40:22,000
I thought you were like ran away.

1910
01:40:24,000 --> 01:40:25,000
Well, I'm still...

1911
01:40:25,000 --> 01:40:29,000
I thought you were sad that you were like can't play CS.

1912
01:40:29,000 --> 01:40:32,000
I'm sad, I'm so bad, yeah.

1913
01:40:35,000 --> 01:40:37,000
That's going to wrap it up here, guys.

1914
01:40:38,000 --> 01:40:40,000
Thanks for coming, everybody.

1915
01:40:41,000 --> 01:40:43,000
And see you guys next time.

1916
01:40:43,000 --> 01:40:45,000
Oh, by the way, I need to make sure you guys all...

1917
01:40:45,000 --> 01:40:47,000
Oh, you're not even going to do quap.

1918
01:40:47,000 --> 01:40:48,000
Oh, you're right.

1919
01:40:48,000 --> 01:40:50,000
What am I thinking?

1920
01:40:52,000 --> 01:40:53,000
Am I out of my mind?

1921
01:40:56,000 --> 01:40:57,000
Quap.

1922
01:40:59,000 --> 01:41:00,000
I'm going to go black.

1923
01:41:01,000 --> 01:41:02,000
Oh, he's gone.

1924
01:41:04,000 --> 01:41:06,000
I thought you were legit rage, but...

1925
01:41:06,000 --> 01:41:08,000
I thought you were like, end sky call.

1926
01:41:08,000 --> 01:41:09,000
And get me out of here.

1927
01:41:11,000 --> 01:41:12,000
I really thought you did that.

1928
01:41:12,000 --> 01:41:13,000
I was like, oh, he's gone.

1929
01:41:13,000 --> 01:41:14,000
And he goes healing.

1930
01:41:16,000 --> 01:41:17,000
Nice.

1931
01:41:17,000 --> 01:41:18,000
Screen region.

1932
01:41:23,000 --> 01:41:24,000
Screen region.

1933
01:41:25,000 --> 01:41:27,000
Let's go for five lives on quap.

1934
01:41:30,000 --> 01:41:32,000
See if we can't do something cool.

1935
01:41:33,000 --> 01:41:34,000
Here we go.

1936
01:41:34,000 --> 01:41:37,000
Just keep good enough at the game so we can hear the music in the background.

1937
01:41:37,000 --> 01:41:39,000
That's never going to happen.

1938
01:41:39,000 --> 01:41:42,000
I will never get good enough at this game for that to not happen.

1939
01:41:46,000 --> 01:41:50,000
Quap looks like Grandpa trying to walk when he has no crutches.

1940
01:41:53,000 --> 01:41:55,000
I almost did a legit back foot.

1941
01:41:56,000 --> 01:41:58,000
I almost did a legit back foot.

1942
01:41:58,000 --> 01:41:59,000
That was sick.

1943
01:42:00,000 --> 01:42:01,000
Oh, good.

1944
01:42:01,000 --> 01:42:02,000
Thanks for reminding me, Woody Delek.

1945
01:42:04,000 --> 01:42:06,000
There is no stream next week and there will be no stream.

1946
01:42:06,000 --> 01:42:11,000
I'm going to be at Paxi's pretty much for the whole Friday Saturday Sunday.

1947
01:42:11,000 --> 01:42:17,000
So there will be no stream next weekend that I will try and do a makeup stream in the middle of the week sometime.

1948
01:42:17,000 --> 01:42:18,000
Probably...

1949
01:42:19,000 --> 01:42:22,000
I would say probably Thursday of that next week after that.

1950
01:42:22,000 --> 01:42:24,000
So no stream next week.

1951
01:42:25,000 --> 01:42:28,000
And I am just sitting here idling like a car.

1952
01:42:33,000 --> 01:42:36,000
Dun dun dun dun dun dun dun dun dun dun dun dun dun dun.

1953
01:42:36,000 --> 01:42:38,000
I'm doing like the skip method.

1954
01:42:41,000 --> 01:42:43,000
The music just keeps coming in.

1955
01:42:49,000 --> 01:42:50,000
I'm so bad at this.

1956
01:42:50,000 --> 01:42:52,000
I can't even get the music to start playing.

1957
01:42:56,000 --> 01:42:57,000
Damn.

1958
01:42:58,000 --> 01:42:59,000
Alright, that's it.

1959
01:42:59,000 --> 01:43:01,000
I'm not going to get better than that.

1960
01:43:01,000 --> 01:43:03,000
So yeah, thanks everybody so much.

1961
01:43:03,000 --> 01:43:05,000
I will see you guys all soon.

1962
01:43:05,000 --> 01:43:06,000
And take care everybody.

1963
01:43:06,000 --> 01:43:08,000
Thanks for coming so much.

1964
01:43:08,000 --> 01:43:09,000
See you later.

1965
01:43:09,000 --> 01:43:10,000
Bye!

1966
01:43:10,000 --> 01:43:11,000
Bye!

1967
01:43:13,000 --> 01:43:14,000
Oh, and we...

1968
01:43:14,000 --> 01:43:15,000
What's it all?

1969
01:43:15,000 --> 01:43:16,000
I'm like frozen.

1970
01:43:16,000 --> 01:43:18,000
I think I'm frozen with the stream on.

1971
01:43:19,000 --> 01:43:20,000
Oh, so, hello.

1972
01:43:20,000 --> 01:43:21,000
What's going on, everybody?

1973
01:43:21,000 --> 01:43:24,000
It's the Jarvis Frozen computer screen.

1974
01:43:24,000 --> 01:43:25,000
And...
