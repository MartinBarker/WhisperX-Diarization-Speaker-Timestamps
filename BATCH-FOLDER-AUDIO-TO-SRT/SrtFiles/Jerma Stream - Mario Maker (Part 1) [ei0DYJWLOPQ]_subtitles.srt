1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:14,000
Hopefully I'm not low now. That's the one scary part.

2
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:24,000
You're going to hear it echo in a second. I need to listen to it.

3
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:35,000
That's my first time streaming from a console. I had no idea what the hell I was doing at all.

4
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:41,000
You're going to hear it echo in a second. I need to listen to it.

5
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:48,000
That's my first time streaming from a console.

6
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:57,000
That should be good.

7
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:03,000
I'm going to have to watch chat on my iPad.

8
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:14,000
I can't have to turn and look at my screen.

9
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:18,000
It sounds better. You can still hear the game.

10
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:32,000
I should be able to. I hope.

11
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:45,000
I can do it right here.

12
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:50,000
That would be swell if I could do that.

13
00:01:50,000 --> 00:02:02,000
Can I?

14
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:08,000
I think so.

15
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:13,000
Let's go.

16
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:23,000
I'm going to load up the chat.

17
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:33,000
I mean like fuck.

18
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:40,000
I'm going to add on my iPad for splatoon.

19
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:46,000
This is just Super Mario Maker.

20
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:53,000
I'm going to get like in a better position here too.

21
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:57,000
No. Looks like someone left this course unfinished.

22
00:02:57,000 --> 00:03:01,000
It's up to you to complete it.

23
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:07,000
Oh shit. I need my other iPad.

24
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:11,000
I'm hearing myself again. I need to put this.

25
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:16,000
This was not well planned.

26
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:19,000
It was my stylus.

27
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:27,000
I'm going to get my stylus so I can do this.

28
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:30,000
Okay. So we've to finish this level.

29
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:35,000
This is Wii U. This is Mario Maker.

30
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:37,000
Why do I have two iPads?

31
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:40,000
I have Wii U iPad.

32
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:44,000
I have a regular iPad so I can read chat.

33
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:47,000
I'm just covered in fucking iPads.

34
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:50,000
I'm probably like microwaving my penis right now.

35
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:56,000
This is bad.

36
00:03:56,000 --> 00:04:01,000
Let's do it. Let me just turn this chat only.

37
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:06,000
You can do that on your iPad.

38
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:11,000
There you are.

39
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:16,000
Follow the on-screen guidance and place elements to build.

40
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:20,000
Let's just finish it.

41
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:23,000
This is cool.

42
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:27,000
That's real cool.

43
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:31,000
Do you put goombas too?

44
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:34,000
You can put like a million goombas.

45
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:37,000
I probably shouldn't be doing that.

46
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:40,000
We've got to finish the level.

47
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:43,000
This is where you're going to put the bra.

48
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:46,000
Just like a regular Mario level.

49
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:49,000
I get you.

50
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:52,000
Fill it in.

51
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:55,000
Just like that popular video game Minecraft.

52
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:58,000
I'm sure you've heard of it at some point.

53
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:01,000
You can't tell me what to do.

54
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:04,000
You can't tell me what to do.

55
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:10,000
Oh, hold on.

56
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:13,000
I can give it wings.

57
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:16,000
Can I give anything wings?

58
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:19,000
You can.

59
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:22,000
Let's beat the level now.

60
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:25,000
Let's do it.

61
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:28,000
Let's do it.

62
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:37,000
That's undue.

63
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:39,000
Let's just close this up.

64
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:43,000
Let's get out of this tutorial.

65
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:46,000
Let's do it.

66
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:49,000
What do you want me to do again?

67
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:52,000
Let's just follow the instructions.

68
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:57,000
That's it, right?

69
00:05:57,000 --> 00:06:00,000
There's the goal.

70
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:02,000
A race mode.

71
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:06,000
Just some just going through to see what the hell the stuff all does.

72
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:09,000
So now where's the...

73
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:13,000
Where's the I'd like to play this level button?

74
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:15,000
That's like the start.

75
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:18,000
Oh, that's what you can do with the start.

76
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:21,000
That's cool.

77
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:24,000
I promise I'll get this.

78
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:27,000
This takes me a minute or two.

79
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:30,000
That's what I did, isn't it?

80
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:33,000
Does it want me to put him here?

81
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:35,000
For...

82
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:38,000
Oh, I guess it wants me to do this.

83
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:39,000
I think.

84
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:40,000
Yeah, okay.

85
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:44,000
Give me the race button.

86
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:46,000
I get it.

87
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:49,000
I have to do it the way the game wants me to do it.

88
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:50,000
I can't do...

89
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:54,000
I can't be creative with the game yet.

90
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:55,000
Okay.

91
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:58,000
There we go.

92
00:06:58,000 --> 00:06:59,000
How's your course looking?

93
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:00,000
Why not give it...

94
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:02,000
I'm going to return to the beginning and give it a trial playthrough.

95
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:04,000
Tap the S to go to the start.

96
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:05,000
Okay.

97
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:09,000
I was below through this.

98
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:11,000
Can I clear my own course?

99
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:14,000
Of course I can.

100
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:15,000
See?

101
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:16,000
I did that on purpose.

102
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:18,000
Let's get them all.

103
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:25,000
Oh no, I died on my own tutorial level.

104
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:27,000
It's okay.

105
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:29,000
Sometimes you die on the tutorial level.

106
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:31,000
Doesn't happen very often.

107
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:35,000
Jeez, what about what's spawning me in a random spot right there?

108
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:40,000
I gotta say I'm not that keen on using this big ass iPad screen to play the game.

109
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:46,000
I'll get my Wii U controller in my hand.

110
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:47,000
Okay.

111
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:51,000
Now, tap the course button to save your very first.

112
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:53,000
I don't want to save that.

113
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:58,000
These little sucks.

114
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:05,000
Okay, well, looks like it's going here.

115
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:06,000
Okay.

116
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:08,000
Ah, not allowed.

117
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:13,000
Not allowed to call it that.

118
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:23,000
Haha.

119
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:25,000
Three new icons in a row.

120
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:33,000
Didn't they have this stuff locked behind some type of nine day unlock system and then they went back on it or something like that?

121
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:36,000
Whatever.

122
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:38,000
Can change the game or day and night underground.

123
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:41,000
That's cool.

124
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:44,000
I'm not going to change the game up here.

125
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:45,000
Super Mario brother.

126
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:47,000
This is the new one.

127
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:50,000
This is the one for Wii U, right?

128
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:51,000
That's cool.

129
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:54,000
And now what does it want me to do?

130
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:58,000
What have we gone?

131
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:03,000
Oh, rocket ship.

132
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:06,000
You now go to the basic tools needed for the course creation.

133
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:09,000
Try different combinations to see what you can come up with into the UQ,

134
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:12,000
course elements.

135
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:14,000
So it just wants me to mess around.

136
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:16,000
Well, let's detonate this.

137
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:24,000
Let's start over from the beginning.

138
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:30,000
I'm trying to get my, I'm trying to look at my other iPad.

139
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:32,000
People used to, people set their clocks ahead.

140
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:34,000
Was it daylight savings time?

141
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:35,000
All right.

142
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:37,000
What even is this?

143
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:47,000
Oh, okay.

144
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:53,000
That's a real easy level.

145
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:54,000
Okay.

146
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:55,000
You want me to go to the main menu.

147
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:59,000
Touch.

148
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:01,000
The key to making fun courses playing lots of courses.

149
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:04,000
Sure.

150
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:06,000
Okay.

151
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:11,000
So this is where I can play other people's levels, right?

152
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:14,000
I guess.

153
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:15,000
Let's do it.

154
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:21,000
Let's see what these people got.

155
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:28,000
What did it just take for me?

156
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:35,000
Stuff is unlocked by pacing.

157
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:40,000
Yeah, auto almost broke the Wii U.

158
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:44,000
I don't know what it is with my dog, but he's, what the fuck?

159
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:48,000
That's, again, my dog and flies.

160
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:56,000
If there's a fly in the house, he loses his mind to a point where he just starts

161
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:58,000
rambling into walls and shit.

162
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:01,000
He starts crashing into everybody.

163
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:03,000
Thanks for the one up.

164
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:05,000
Does somebody make this level?

165
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:07,000
I'm assuming they did.

166
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:10,000
What?

167
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:12,000
Get out of here.

168
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:14,000
But anyway, so.

169
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:16,000
Oh my god, that was cool.

170
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:22,000
So there was a fly in the house and he ran into a bunch of chords and ripped the Wii U off the shelf and landed on the ground.

171
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:26,000
I thought it broke.

172
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:29,000
That's kind of cool.

173
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:32,000
See, this person knows what they're doing.

174
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:38,000
All of my levels are going to suck.

175
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:41,000
Dude.

176
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:44,000
He's got doors too.

177
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:45,000
Cool.

178
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:51,000
This is a green door.

179
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:54,000
I'm about to fall.

180
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:56,000
Okay, that was cool.

181
00:11:56,000 --> 00:12:01,000
Oh, this is an official Nintendo level.

182
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:10,000
We're just going to go next.

183
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:12,000
Try Blung and Blow through these.

184
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:15,000
This just goes fast as we can so we can get to the most important thing.

185
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:18,000
And that's making a level.

186
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:22,000
This is Super Mario Maker, not Super Mario World.

187
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:27,000
Well, this one's the different Mario.

188
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:33,000
All right, we're going to go off shit really.

189
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:34,000
Is it?

190
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:36,000
Where's the door?

191
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:40,000
Where's the innovation Nintendo?

192
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:45,000
Can I whack that?

193
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:51,000
Oh, if you have a double jump.

194
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:55,000
I thought you could jump on the wrenches.

195
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:58,000
I was certain you could jump on the wrenches.

196
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:02,000
You're going to give me nine tries to do this.

197
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:04,000
All right, let's go.

198
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:05,000
Blow through it.

199
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:11,000
I'll go to the store this time.

200
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:24,000
That's a go.

201
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:26,000
People saying some at some points is laggy.

202
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:27,000
I don't know.

203
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:35,000
Maybe that's something to do with how I'm pulling through the connection.

204
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:37,000
Oh oh.

205
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:40,000
The strap is lagging.

206
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:45,000
buddy. Wait, this is the... wait, did this one, didn't I?

207
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:58,000
Oh, did that just make a horn? Like a clown horn?

208
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:08,000
I don't know, you could do like sound effects too, that's cool.

209
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:15,000
I didn't know that, but I'm glad I was able to play it.

210
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:23,000
I'm glad I was able to play it.

211
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:31,000
Might as well be a rough patch, or not. Happened sometimes with this.

212
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:36,000
The router I have is kind of a piece of shit.

213
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:41,000
You can record your own voice in these?

214
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:45,000
Oh my goodness, we're definitely doing that.

215
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:49,000
Watch out for boo. Fuck.

216
00:14:57,000 --> 00:15:00,000
Oh no, no, I'm just trying to do the rush tactic.

217
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:04,000
You know, we're still gonna do the rush tactic, I think.

218
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:10,000
No, we're not. Let's just go.

219
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:16,000
See ya.

220
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:21,000
Generic bird noises.

221
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:28,000
Recorded voices only play on welcome machine, not online. That's still kind of cool though.

222
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:33,000
Help! Help!

223
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:38,000
When his tip of the hat starts, it's tomorrow Saturday.

224
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:41,000
Ooh, this is Mario 3.

225
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:46,000
That's cool. How many different Mario games are in this?

226
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:51,000
I did not know, I actually did not know that that's what that was.

227
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:54,000
I thought that was just a little thing I could jump on.

228
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:59,000
And then fire went right up my ass.

229
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:07,000
I gotta ride this, I think.

230
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:17,000
What? What are we missing here?

231
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:23,000
I'm gonna hit him like 50 times, it'll break.

232
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:26,000
No, alright, we did that and do something over here then.

233
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:30,000
Go in this pipe?

234
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:35,000
I think it's not.

235
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:42,000
Huh.

236
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:45,000
Oh, you can pick these up, can't you?

237
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:50,000
You said that you could.

238
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:54,000
You know, you wait for the P block to come over?

239
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:58,000
Oh.

240
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:03,000
How much was it to get that?

241
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:09,000
Oh shit, that shoots fireballs too, that's good to know.

242
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:16,000
A piece which is journey, I guess it's in the title.

243
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:22,000
Oh, okay. I have to knock it up there so I get it.

244
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:27,000
There it is.

245
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:32,000
Actually, we're crying out of that.

246
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:35,000
We're crying out of timing.

247
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:38,000
Oh my fucking god.

248
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:42,000
I waited for the exact moment where that was gonna happen.

249
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:44,000
That's gonna be a long night.

250
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:49,000
It's gonna be a fucking long night if I'm gonna do shit like that.

251
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:56,000
Not even gonna watch it, just stay over here.

252
00:17:56,000 --> 00:18:09,000
Come on, I'm getting antsy, come on, I'm getting antsy.

253
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:14,000
I hope that go for doesn't steal it.

254
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:16,000
Do I have to go up?

255
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:20,000
No, I don't.

256
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:23,000
Yeah!

257
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:28,000
There we go.

258
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:30,000
Yeah, somebody asked about Super The Hat.

259
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:34,000
Super The Hat starts tomorrow at 12?

260
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:43,000
I think.

261
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:47,000
This is Mario World. I used to love this game.

262
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:52,000
This is a fantastic game.

263
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:55,000
Okay.

264
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:57,000
I'm gonna take it.

265
00:18:57,000 --> 00:18:59,000
Why would it give me another one?

266
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:02,000
There's definitely a reason why it gave me another one.

267
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:03,000
Take?

268
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:08,000
Oh shit.

269
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:11,000
Oh fuck!

270
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:19,000
You know, my brain was clicking there for a second.

271
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:23,000
I saw the stairs going up and I'm just like, oh no.

272
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:27,000
I shouldn't have done that.

273
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:29,000
Good thing there's infinite amount of them.

274
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:32,000
No, I don't even need to do that.

275
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:37,000
There's no reason to do what I've just did.

276
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:38,000
See?

277
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:40,000
There we go.

278
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:47,000
I actually just made that harder for myself.

279
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:55,000
There we go.

280
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:57,000
All right, for it to open.

281
00:19:57,000 --> 00:20:00,000
That was annoying.

282
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:06,000
Okay.

283
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:09,000
Who is screaming?

284
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:13,000
Yay.

285
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:15,000
Hiya.

286
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:17,000
That's it.

287
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:19,000
All right. Thanks for coming to the stream.

288
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:29,000
I just beat Super Mario Maker. Game over. I won.

289
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:31,000
Am I gonna make an impossible level?

290
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:33,000
No, I'm gonna try and make a weird one.

291
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:37,000
I don't know about a pine possible.

292
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:46,000
Ooh.

293
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:51,000
Something about the aesthetic of Mario 3 is just such a cool looking game.

294
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:56,000
Out of all the Mario's, it's probably my favorite looking Mario.

295
00:20:56,000 --> 00:21:00,000
Let's do it how everybody looks cool.

296
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:03,000
Oh wait a minute, can I?

297
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:05,000
Does this still work?

298
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:08,000
Didn't this do something in the other game?

299
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:11,000
I think I did.

300
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:13,000
I think I, oh, I fucked that one up.

301
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:15,000
I'll put the kick it that way.

302
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:17,000
But these things like distracted me.

303
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:19,000
There's so many of them.

304
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:24,000
How do you get them stacked like that?

305
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:26,000
Whoa, that's not.

306
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:29,000
That's weird.

307
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:31,000
Let's fly.

308
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:34,000
Whoa, that was awesome.

309
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:36,000
What innovation?

310
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:39,000
Seriously Nintendo, what innovation?

311
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:42,000
Let's fly.

312
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:48,000
Here we go.

313
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:50,000
Can I get the one up?

314
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:53,000
Does this enough for me to run and fly?

315
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:55,000
I hope so.

316
00:21:58,000 --> 00:22:00,000
No!

317
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:01,000
Shit.

318
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:04,000
I'm not going anywhere, whatever.

319
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:12,000
I believe no, these are not custom levels.

320
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:18,000
These are the Nintendo official sample courses.

321
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:22,000
This is the last level here, I think, right?

322
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:25,000
I just hope so.

323
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:27,000
I've got seven lives.

324
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:29,000
Lucky number seven.

325
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:31,000
Okay.

326
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:39,000
Just don't even stop running.

327
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:42,000
Don't stop at anything.

328
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:44,000
See?

329
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:46,000
You just can't stop moving.

330
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:49,000
There's the secret to every Super Mario Brothers.

331
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:50,000
Eat shit.

332
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:55,000
I just beat that like, I beat that up problem because I did the don't stop moving to active.

333
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:04,000
Magic flute, I remember the magic flute, the thing was so cool.

334
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:13,000
Sorry, your princess is in another castle.

335
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:20,000
What was he saying?

336
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:23,000
Stop paying attention.

337
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:28,000
To be continued, please buy Mario Maker 2.

338
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:32,000
New courses will become available each time you complete this mode.

339
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:36,000
There are lots of fun courses to play, so be sure to come back again soon.

340
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:39,000
Okay.

341
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:44,000
Well, should I just go back to the main menu?

342
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:46,000
Course World.

343
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:48,000
Let's do that.

344
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:52,000
Let's see some of the cool shit that people have made.

345
00:23:53,000 --> 00:23:57,000
Comment on use courses, okay?

346
00:23:57,000 --> 00:23:59,000
Cool.

347
00:23:59,000 --> 00:24:02,000
That sounds like fun.

348
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:06,000
What the hell's going on there?

349
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:09,000
Oh, he's doing sit-ups.

350
00:24:09,000 --> 00:24:11,000
Okay.

351
00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:14,000
Good to know.

352
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:17,000
What?

353
00:24:17,000 --> 00:24:23,000
100 Mario Challenge courses, makers, which is going to courses?

354
00:24:23,000 --> 00:24:24,000
Featured.

355
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:28,000
Mr. Chomp's doghouse.

356
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:30,000
I mean, look at that.

357
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:31,000
What the hell's going on here?

358
00:24:31,000 --> 00:24:32,000
Let's do it.

359
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:37,000
Mr. Chomp's doghouse.

360
00:24:37,000 --> 00:24:43,000
Okay, whatever.

361
00:24:43,000 --> 00:24:47,000
Yeah, I got to ease in.

362
00:24:47,000 --> 00:24:52,000
We're going to take these really slowly because some of these levels are probably extremely difficult.

363
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:53,000
You know what?

364
00:24:53,000 --> 00:24:58,000
Go up if you want to have- oh, fuck.

365
00:24:58,000 --> 00:24:59,000
We did it.

366
00:24:59,000 --> 00:25:01,000
We already died.

367
00:25:01,000 --> 00:25:02,000
What does that say?

368
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:03,000
Go up if you want to.

369
00:25:03,000 --> 00:25:04,000
What?

370
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:06,000
Go up if you want an easier time.

371
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:10,000
There's another way for me to go besides up.

372
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:12,000
Oh, no, this right here.

373
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:13,000
Okay.

374
00:25:13,000 --> 00:25:15,000
Oh, no, we're going to go to the right.

375
00:25:15,000 --> 00:25:21,000
We're not going to go up.

376
00:25:21,000 --> 00:25:26,000
Wait for the- now go.

377
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:29,000
Ooh, that was close.

378
00:25:29,000 --> 00:25:30,000
That was real close.

379
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:35,000
That was an accident is what that was.

380
00:25:35,000 --> 00:25:36,000
Yeah.

381
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:39,000
Oh, geez.

382
00:25:39,000 --> 00:25:43,000
These hammer brothers.

383
00:25:43,000 --> 00:25:48,000
This is-

384
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:55,000
I'm not going to be hard.

385
00:25:55,000 --> 00:26:03,000
I'm not going to be hard.

386
00:26:03,000 --> 00:26:08,000
I'm not going to be- I forgot that that was there.

387
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:11,000
Alright, so this is like one of the harder levels.

388
00:26:11,000 --> 00:26:13,000
Where's like the your 11?

389
00:26:13,000 --> 00:26:19,000
Welcome to Super Mario levels.

390
00:26:19,000 --> 00:26:21,000
You know you kind of just have to memorize everything.

391
00:26:21,000 --> 00:26:22,000
You should be good to go.

392
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:23,000
Oh, yeah, like that.

393
00:26:23,000 --> 00:26:24,000
Like that.

394
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:28,000
I should fucking memorize that too.

395
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:29,000
What?

396
00:26:29,000 --> 00:26:30,000
Attack.

397
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:31,000
What am I doing?

398
00:26:31,000 --> 00:26:34,000
Missing the most important tactic of all.

399
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:37,000
Are you serious, guys?

400
00:26:37,000 --> 00:26:44,000
I would have had it if I had gone when I should have gone.

401
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:54,000
Oh fuck every time.

402
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:56,000
I keep forgetting that this- that comes right down.

403
00:26:56,000 --> 00:27:03,000
I need to wait.

404
00:27:03,000 --> 00:27:05,000
How long is this level?

405
00:27:05,000 --> 00:27:09,000
Probably much longer than this, too.

406
00:27:09,000 --> 00:27:19,000
God.

407
00:27:19,000 --> 00:27:24,000
Alright, so we're going to- we're going to do this one more time.

408
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:32,000
And then I'm going to rage quit and play a different one.

409
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:35,000
No, watch out.

410
00:27:35,000 --> 00:27:38,000
Oh fuck me.

411
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:41,000
I never go to beat this level.

412
00:27:41,000 --> 00:27:44,000
If you gave me a thousand dollars to beat this level in the next 10 minutes,

413
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:49,000
I don't think it would happen.

414
00:27:49,000 --> 00:27:50,000
Oh my god.

415
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:51,000
I see I'm rushing it now.

416
00:27:51,000 --> 00:27:53,000
They have fucking Russian.

417
00:27:53,000 --> 00:27:59,000
Too much rice.

418
00:27:59,000 --> 00:28:01,000
Alright, one more try.

419
00:28:01,000 --> 00:28:02,000
I'm going to go up.

420
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:04,000
We'll see if it's an easier time to go up.

421
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:11,000
Like he states in the instruction manual.

422
00:28:11,000 --> 00:28:12,000
This does look easier.

423
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:13,000
There's a mushroom.

424
00:28:13,000 --> 00:28:19,000
Okay.

425
00:28:19,000 --> 00:28:21,000
That isn't easier time.

426
00:28:21,000 --> 00:28:23,000
Give me this thing.

427
00:28:23,000 --> 00:28:28,000
Okay, give me the fuck out of the way.

428
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:30,000
Give me out of this level.

429
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:32,000
Skip the whole level.

430
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:33,000
Oh god.

431
00:28:33,000 --> 00:28:35,000
This- this the cloud is going to end.

432
00:28:35,000 --> 00:28:41,000
Where's the entrance?

433
00:28:41,000 --> 00:28:50,000
Shit, it's a door.

434
00:28:50,000 --> 00:28:51,000
Shit.

435
00:28:51,000 --> 00:28:52,000
Now I got to do that.

436
00:28:52,000 --> 00:28:55,000
That- going through here with the hammer brothers is seriously-

437
00:28:55,000 --> 00:28:59,000
Geez.

438
00:28:59,000 --> 00:29:08,000
Get a wait for a good opportunity.

439
00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:10,000
Just stop moving.

440
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:11,000
Stop this thing.

441
00:29:11,000 --> 00:29:16,000
Follow up with God.

442
00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:17,000
They're all on the ground.

443
00:29:17,000 --> 00:29:18,000
They're down, down, down.

444
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:19,000
Throwin', throwin', throwin'.

445
00:29:19,000 --> 00:29:21,000
He's going to start moving again.

446
00:29:21,000 --> 00:29:24,000
Oh fuck.

447
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:33,000
You're going to do an easy way again.

448
00:29:33,000 --> 00:29:34,000
Nope.

449
00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:38,000
You got to have momentum to do an easy way.

450
00:29:38,000 --> 00:29:39,000
Like that.

451
00:29:39,000 --> 00:29:44,000
This time I shouldn't lose the mushroom.

452
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:49,000
Because I know what's down here.

453
00:29:49,000 --> 00:29:51,000
Give me that.

454
00:29:51,000 --> 00:29:53,000
Oh my fucking god.

455
00:29:53,000 --> 00:30:01,000
What happened there?

456
00:30:01,000 --> 00:30:02,000
Okay.

457
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:04,000
How do I say I give up?

458
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:06,000
And I'd like to play a different course, please.

459
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:09,000
Here we go.

460
00:30:09,000 --> 00:30:13,000
Cool level.

461
00:30:13,000 --> 00:30:16,000
What else is there?

462
00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:17,000
So what does this mean?

463
00:30:17,000 --> 00:30:18,000
13 out of 44?

464
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:19,000
Like what does that mean?

465
00:30:19,000 --> 00:30:25,000
I was right at the end, too.

466
00:30:25,000 --> 00:30:27,000
Is this underwater?

467
00:30:27,000 --> 00:30:30,000
Jump or dead?

468
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:34,000
Okay.

469
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:43,000
I'm going to do jump or dead.

470
00:30:43,000 --> 00:30:44,000
This one's called jump or dead.

471
00:30:44,000 --> 00:30:45,000
Okay.

472
00:30:45,000 --> 00:30:49,000
Alright, let me get this like fucking iPad off my stomach.

473
00:30:49,000 --> 00:30:52,000
I have two of these iPads on me.

474
00:30:52,000 --> 00:30:55,000
It's causing me all kinds of discomfort.

475
00:30:55,000 --> 00:30:56,000
See, look at him.

476
00:30:56,000 --> 00:31:00,000
I'm like moving and shit when I don't want to be.

477
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:03,000
Let's see here.

478
00:31:03,000 --> 00:31:05,000
This is like yellow.

479
00:31:05,000 --> 00:31:09,000
I didn't play any of these old Mario, so I don't know what the hell these things are.

480
00:31:09,000 --> 00:31:10,000
Okay.

481
00:31:10,000 --> 00:31:14,000
Well, I didn't really do much.

482
00:31:15,000 --> 00:31:20,000
I'm confused already.

483
00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:22,000
Okay.

484
00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:29,000
What does that stuff do?

485
00:31:29,000 --> 00:31:32,000
Alright, so if I can, I can wall jump.

486
00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:34,000
I think I get it.

487
00:31:34,000 --> 00:31:38,000
I think you have to just land on that one softly.

488
00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:41,000
I think.

489
00:31:41,000 --> 00:31:43,000
Okay, no, you have to bring it with you.

490
00:31:43,000 --> 00:31:47,000
Holy shit, what the hell is going on?

491
00:31:47,000 --> 00:31:52,000
This thing's just firing all kinds of power-ups at me.

492
00:31:52,000 --> 00:31:55,000
Alright, well, can I jump on their heads?

493
00:31:55,000 --> 00:32:01,000
Yes, I can.

494
00:32:01,000 --> 00:32:02,000
Let's just move.

495
00:32:02,000 --> 00:32:03,000
I got it.

496
00:32:03,000 --> 00:32:05,000
Wait, no, I can have wall jump.

497
00:32:05,000 --> 00:32:07,000
Or do I?

498
00:32:07,000 --> 00:32:10,000
Yeah.

499
00:32:10,000 --> 00:32:11,000
I have no idea.

500
00:32:11,000 --> 00:32:18,000
I have no idea.

501
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:21,000
At least I know what to do.

502
00:32:21,000 --> 00:32:23,000
This one, I'll just wait.

503
00:32:23,000 --> 00:32:26,000
Should I bring this with me?

504
00:32:26,000 --> 00:32:30,000
I feel like I should just bring it with me.

505
00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:33,000
Make my life a little easier later.

506
00:32:33,000 --> 00:32:39,000
I guess I can't bring it with me anymore.

507
00:32:39,000 --> 00:32:41,000
Get out of here, you giant gumbas.

508
00:32:41,000 --> 00:32:46,000
Oh my god.

509
00:32:46,000 --> 00:32:51,000
Okay, that was weird.

510
00:32:51,000 --> 00:32:58,000
That was very weird.

511
00:32:58,000 --> 00:33:02,000
Holy shit, dude, I'm so fucking bad at this game.

512
00:33:02,000 --> 00:33:08,000
It's like unbelievable.

513
00:33:08,000 --> 00:33:09,000
I got it.

514
00:33:09,000 --> 00:33:14,000
Hey, look, I picked up the fucking item.

515
00:33:14,000 --> 00:33:19,000
Hey, you know those things when I told you about having to be very, like, pay a ton of attention

516
00:33:19,000 --> 00:33:21,000
when you're playing a game?

517
00:33:21,000 --> 00:33:22,000
This is one of those games.

518
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:25,000
What the fuck was I thinking?

519
00:33:25,000 --> 00:33:26,000
I should just, like, play.

520
00:33:26,000 --> 00:33:28,000
I should just, like, just actually make a level.

521
00:33:28,000 --> 00:33:33,000
I'm going to be more fun than dying over and over again.

522
00:33:33,000 --> 00:33:40,000
Wait, this is a dick?

523
00:33:40,000 --> 00:33:43,000
Is that what people are saying?

524
00:33:43,000 --> 00:33:51,000
Oh, okay, maybe it is.

525
00:33:51,000 --> 00:33:56,000
I'm just going to wait.

526
00:33:56,000 --> 00:34:05,000
It just, like, spits out a ton of things.

527
00:34:05,000 --> 00:34:06,000
What is going on there?

528
00:34:06,000 --> 00:34:10,000
Why does it keep doing that?

529
00:34:10,000 --> 00:34:12,000
All right, something's going on here.

530
00:34:12,000 --> 00:34:15,000
Why do I keep going down?

531
00:34:15,000 --> 00:34:20,000
What the fuck was that?

532
00:34:20,000 --> 00:34:25,000
Jesus!

533
00:34:26,000 --> 00:34:31,000
We're going to go to, like, the little kid ride.

534
00:34:31,000 --> 00:34:35,000
Where's the kid ride?

535
00:34:35,000 --> 00:34:41,000
Is there, are there levels, like, specifically designed for fucking old people?

536
00:34:41,000 --> 00:34:44,000
Let's take a look at the up and coming.

537
00:34:44,000 --> 00:34:47,000
Wow, look at that one.

538
00:34:47,000 --> 00:34:51,000
Three-course meal.

539
00:34:51,000 --> 00:34:54,000
Let's check out this one.

540
00:34:56,000 --> 00:34:59,000
Actually, I'm going to use this.

541
00:34:59,000 --> 00:35:01,000
Forget about the We-Moke controller.

542
00:35:01,000 --> 00:35:06,000
I keep doing, like, ground pounds.

543
00:35:06,000 --> 00:35:08,000
Okay, that one falls.

544
00:35:08,000 --> 00:35:10,000
All right, that feels a lot better in my hands now,

545
00:35:10,000 --> 00:35:15,000
other than I'm sitting here playing it.

546
00:35:15,000 --> 00:35:22,000
I say that now.

547
00:35:22,000 --> 00:35:28,000
Fuck.

548
00:35:28,000 --> 00:35:34,000
So I have to break in my hands now.

549
00:35:34,000 --> 00:35:39,000
Get in there.

550
00:35:39,000 --> 00:35:44,000
Ah!

551
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:51,000
Holy shit, this is fucking terrible.

552
00:35:51,000 --> 00:35:58,000
I'm so bad at Mario.

553
00:35:58,000 --> 00:36:03,000
All right, can I get past, like, the furt.

554
00:36:03,000 --> 00:36:04,000
Look it up there.

555
00:36:04,000 --> 00:36:11,000
You think I'm going to get by that shit?

556
00:36:12,000 --> 00:36:17,000
Oh.

557
00:36:17,000 --> 00:36:24,000
Oh, God.

558
00:36:24,000 --> 00:36:32,000
I can't fucking play this game.

559
00:36:32,000 --> 00:36:35,000
All right, I'm going to sound like a crazy person here.

560
00:36:35,000 --> 00:36:38,000
Maybe I'm a crazy person.

561
00:36:38,000 --> 00:36:41,000
But I feel like I have an input delay.

562
00:36:41,000 --> 00:36:44,000
I really think I do.

563
00:36:44,000 --> 00:36:46,000
Because when I'm hitting the jump button,

564
00:36:46,000 --> 00:36:50,000
it's almost like it's happening, like,

565
00:36:50,000 --> 00:36:52,000
maybe, like, two to three hundred milliseconds later.

566
00:36:52,000 --> 00:36:53,000
Maybe that's what's happening.

567
00:36:53,000 --> 00:36:56,000
I'm just going to tell myself that's what's happening.

568
00:36:56,000 --> 00:37:02,000
I think it is happening.

569
00:37:02,000 --> 00:37:05,000
All right, we're going to go up.

570
00:37:05,000 --> 00:37:07,000
Can I, like, plug this thing in?

571
00:37:07,000 --> 00:37:09,000
Maybe it's because I'm streaming it or something.

572
00:37:09,000 --> 00:37:11,000
I have no idea what's going on.

573
00:37:11,000 --> 00:37:13,000
But gosh darn it!

574
00:37:13,000 --> 00:37:15,000
I'm protected.

575
00:37:15,000 --> 00:37:16,000
That's really cool.

576
00:37:16,000 --> 00:37:22,000
That's a cool idea.

577
00:37:22,000 --> 00:37:23,000
I like this way better.

578
00:37:23,000 --> 00:37:34,000
This one gives you the helmet.

579
00:37:34,000 --> 00:37:39,000
I'm going to get through this.

580
00:37:39,000 --> 00:37:40,000
I guess there's weight.

581
00:37:40,000 --> 00:37:41,000
Just wait.

582
00:37:41,000 --> 00:37:42,000
They'll all just murder each other.

583
00:37:42,000 --> 00:37:45,000
That's perfect.

584
00:37:45,000 --> 00:37:48,000
Okay, come on.

585
00:37:48,000 --> 00:37:57,000
Get the fuck away from me.

586
00:37:57,000 --> 00:37:58,000
Hey, look guys.

587
00:37:58,000 --> 00:38:03,000
I beat a level.

588
00:38:03,000 --> 00:38:08,000
Do I sound like I'm like one second behind I do?

589
00:38:08,000 --> 00:38:10,000
I don't know.

590
00:38:10,000 --> 00:38:12,000
Maybe that's what's going on.

591
00:38:12,000 --> 00:38:13,000
I'm going to figure that out.

592
00:38:13,000 --> 00:38:15,000
Let's see what's going on.

593
00:38:15,000 --> 00:38:18,000
Okay, okay, I'm going to, how do I give this like a ten star rating?

594
00:38:18,000 --> 00:38:19,000
Like, I beat your level.

595
00:38:19,000 --> 00:38:23,000
Good job.

596
00:38:23,000 --> 00:38:25,000
How do I say that?

597
00:38:25,000 --> 00:38:28,000
That was cool.

598
00:38:28,000 --> 00:38:29,000
I don't know.

599
00:38:29,000 --> 00:38:31,000
You comments?

600
00:38:31,000 --> 00:38:38,000
Around the comments.

601
00:38:38,000 --> 00:38:44,000
I don't want to let up the me verse.

602
00:38:44,000 --> 00:38:47,000
No, I don't want to get me back.

603
00:38:47,000 --> 00:38:54,000
Close the me verse.

604
00:38:54,000 --> 00:39:01,000
I'm going to make a level.

605
00:39:01,000 --> 00:39:06,000
If I'm having trouble jumping,

606
00:39:06,000 --> 00:39:13,000
then I can't really play Super Mario Brothers if you can't jump.

607
00:39:13,000 --> 00:39:17,000
Where's the stylus?

608
00:39:17,000 --> 00:39:24,000
What I do with it, I want to make a level.

609
00:39:24,000 --> 00:39:28,000
I hadn't sit in here.

610
00:39:28,000 --> 00:39:32,000
Maybe in one of my tie raids I just threw it.

611
00:39:32,000 --> 00:39:33,000
Did I throw it?

612
00:39:33,000 --> 00:39:34,000
I don't think I threw it.

613
00:39:34,000 --> 00:39:39,000
Now, why would I have done that?

614
00:39:39,000 --> 00:39:41,000
Let's go back to the menu.

615
00:39:41,000 --> 00:39:42,000
I guess I can do it with a man.

616
00:39:42,000 --> 00:39:49,000
Let's make a cool course.

617
00:39:49,000 --> 00:39:59,000
Touching a me bow to the...

618
00:39:59,000 --> 00:40:01,000
I don't have an me bow.

619
00:40:01,000 --> 00:40:06,000
Then one me bow is here.

620
00:40:06,000 --> 00:40:13,000
Let's reset this whole thing.

621
00:40:13,000 --> 00:40:21,000
I don't think I want to do this Mario.

622
00:40:21,000 --> 00:40:28,000
Let's go daytime.

623
00:40:28,000 --> 00:40:32,000
Is there a way I can extend that to the others?

624
00:40:33,000 --> 00:40:39,000
This one's going to be called Mushroom City.

625
00:40:39,000 --> 00:40:41,000
It'll be very particular.

626
00:40:41,000 --> 00:40:44,000
It'll be very, very difficult.

627
00:40:44,000 --> 00:40:47,000
Start here.

628
00:40:47,000 --> 00:40:52,000
Here's one of the stairs there.

629
00:40:52,000 --> 00:40:53,000
You need to hit that.

630
00:40:53,000 --> 00:40:56,000
Inside of that,

631
00:40:56,000 --> 00:41:01,000
we have Mushroom in that one.

632
00:41:01,000 --> 00:41:05,000
Then you get that Mushroom.

633
00:41:05,000 --> 00:41:07,000
Then you go down a little.

634
00:41:07,000 --> 00:41:14,000
Let's clean this up.

635
00:41:14,000 --> 00:41:17,000
Let's put that there.

636
00:41:17,000 --> 00:41:20,000
Put a pipe over here too.

637
00:41:20,000 --> 00:41:27,000
I just want one pipe.

638
00:41:27,000 --> 00:41:30,000
How do I extend the pipe?

639
00:41:30,000 --> 00:41:37,000
Should be able to do it right.

640
00:41:37,000 --> 00:41:39,000
I've got to have a Guomba over there.

641
00:41:39,000 --> 00:41:46,000
That's the very scary enemy that you first encounter.

642
00:41:46,000 --> 00:41:53,000
There's some bricks down here.

643
00:41:53,000 --> 00:41:56,000
Then it goes up like that.

644
00:41:56,000 --> 00:42:03,000
We're going to go back to this.

645
00:42:03,000 --> 00:42:06,000
A couple of coins.

646
00:42:06,000 --> 00:42:07,000
Mushroom.

647
00:42:07,000 --> 00:42:09,000
This is Mushroom City.

648
00:42:09,000 --> 00:42:12,000
You can't have it without a bunch of mushrooms there.

649
00:42:12,000 --> 00:42:14,000
Then we've got a couple of things there.

650
00:42:14,000 --> 00:42:15,000
Then it's a long jump.

651
00:42:15,000 --> 00:42:17,000
Be aware of this long gap, ladies and gentlemen.

652
00:42:17,000 --> 00:42:19,000
You might not make it.

653
00:42:19,000 --> 00:42:25,000
Now you might not make it.

654
00:42:26,000 --> 00:42:28,000
You have a broken blue.

655
00:42:28,000 --> 00:42:32,000
Just to just to just to piss you off a little block there.

656
00:42:32,000 --> 00:42:35,000
You put a broken block there.

657
00:42:35,000 --> 00:42:38,000
Fuck you I did.

658
00:42:38,000 --> 00:42:43,000
Mushroom City.

659
00:42:43,000 --> 00:42:46,000
Mushroom City.

660
00:42:46,000 --> 00:42:49,000
There you go.

661
00:42:49,000 --> 00:42:53,000
Ladies and gentlemen, I present to you a Mario Maker level

662
00:42:53,000 --> 00:42:56,000
that was made by a seven year old.

663
00:42:56,000 --> 00:43:01,000
If I gave this Mario Maker to like my little cousin or something

664
00:43:01,000 --> 00:43:05,000
and I said hey make me a level junior.

665
00:43:05,000 --> 00:43:06,000
Okay, that's it.

666
00:43:06,000 --> 00:43:08,000
It's a mushroom city.

667
00:43:08,000 --> 00:43:09,000
Very good.

668
00:43:09,000 --> 00:43:10,000
Very good.

669
00:43:10,000 --> 00:43:11,000
This is wonderful.

670
00:43:11,000 --> 00:43:15,000
Let's play it.

671
00:43:15,000 --> 00:43:17,000
Oh, why did I start here?

672
00:43:17,000 --> 00:43:22,000
This is not how Mushroom City is supposed to be.

673
00:43:22,000 --> 00:43:25,000
I messed up, I messed home on, I messed it up.

674
00:43:25,000 --> 00:43:29,000
That was my spawn point.

675
00:43:29,000 --> 00:43:34,000
Right here, right?

676
00:43:34,000 --> 00:43:37,000
Zero, oh, like start.

677
00:43:37,000 --> 00:43:39,000
Yeah, start right here.

678
00:43:39,000 --> 00:43:44,000
So what the hell is this?

679
00:43:44,000 --> 00:43:47,000
All right, it's just where I'm standing.

680
00:43:47,000 --> 00:43:51,000
All right, let's play.

681
00:43:51,000 --> 00:43:54,000
What do you think there's a mushroom?

682
00:43:54,000 --> 00:43:57,000
Yeah, this is what I'm talking about.

683
00:43:57,000 --> 00:44:02,000
Now this is like a Mario level I can get behind.

684
00:44:02,000 --> 00:44:06,000
City is just jumping around.

685
00:44:06,000 --> 00:44:09,000
What is going on with that?

686
00:44:09,000 --> 00:44:14,000
Whatever.

687
00:44:14,000 --> 00:44:16,000
We have to expand.

688
00:44:16,000 --> 00:44:18,000
This is not good enough.

689
00:44:18,000 --> 00:44:20,000
Now you know what?

690
00:44:20,000 --> 00:44:23,000
This is how this is going to work.

691
00:44:23,000 --> 00:44:29,000
You can't touch this yet.

692
00:44:29,000 --> 00:44:33,000
Delete some of those.

693
00:44:33,000 --> 00:44:39,000
Let's go up here.

694
00:44:39,000 --> 00:44:43,000
This is really cool that you can actually do this.

695
00:44:48,000 --> 00:44:51,000
Is this even going to work?

696
00:44:51,000 --> 00:44:54,000
Can I jump up here like this?

697
00:44:54,000 --> 00:45:00,000
I think you can.

698
00:45:00,000 --> 00:45:03,000
There it is there.

699
00:45:03,000 --> 00:45:06,000
This doesn't need to be there.

700
00:45:06,000 --> 00:45:10,000
New course elements will arrive on Sunday.

701
00:45:10,000 --> 00:45:13,000
Okay.

702
00:45:13,000 --> 00:45:16,000
Put a guy here.

703
00:45:16,000 --> 00:45:23,000
There we go.

704
00:45:23,000 --> 00:45:26,000
Where's the...

705
00:45:26,000 --> 00:45:31,000
Where's the... there it is.

706
00:45:31,000 --> 00:45:34,000
Move this.

707
00:45:34,000 --> 00:45:37,000
You go up there.

708
00:45:37,000 --> 00:45:41,000
Yeah, that's going to be a hazard.

709
00:45:47,000 --> 00:45:49,000
Coin right above him.

710
00:45:49,000 --> 00:45:52,000
You know, the troll the people that want to play level like...

711
00:45:52,000 --> 00:45:53,000
Oh look at all these coins.

712
00:45:53,000 --> 00:45:57,000
You're going to get eaten by the thing from Little Shop Hars.

713
00:45:57,000 --> 00:46:04,000
Okay, watch them in there.

714
00:46:04,000 --> 00:46:06,000
See if they can't get these?

715
00:46:06,000 --> 00:46:11,000
They're going to be very disappointed that they can't get those.

716
00:46:11,000 --> 00:46:14,000
Good.

717
00:46:15,000 --> 00:46:18,000
Yeah, just a couple of coins.

718
00:46:18,000 --> 00:46:20,000
This is going to go up.

719
00:46:20,000 --> 00:46:23,000
How much further up can I go?

720
00:46:23,000 --> 00:46:25,000
Then you have to fall.

721
00:46:25,000 --> 00:46:28,000
But the real scary part about falling.

722
00:46:28,000 --> 00:46:33,000
As you never going to know what like you might like run into.

723
00:46:33,000 --> 00:46:37,000
Alright, let's test it.

724
00:46:37,000 --> 00:46:43,000
Test it.

725
00:46:43,000 --> 00:46:50,000
We'll go from up here.

726
00:46:50,000 --> 00:46:55,000
Thank you.

727
00:46:55,000 --> 00:47:00,000
Thank you very much.

728
00:47:00,000 --> 00:47:02,000
Oh, I got a mushroom.

729
00:47:02,000 --> 00:47:04,000
Nice.

730
00:47:04,000 --> 00:47:06,000
Oh, fuck.

731
00:47:06,000 --> 00:47:09,000
I think I might have just...

732
00:47:09,000 --> 00:47:10,000
Where is he?

733
00:47:10,000 --> 00:47:36,000
I think I understand the basics of how to do this.

734
00:47:36,000 --> 00:47:38,000
Oh, let's make a real level.

735
00:47:38,000 --> 00:47:45,000
Do I have to play through the other shit to unlock the other stuff?

736
00:47:45,000 --> 00:47:46,000
I'm assuming I do.

737
00:47:46,000 --> 00:48:02,000
It seemed like there was like the other courses to do.

738
00:48:02,000 --> 00:48:08,000
That looks perfect.

739
00:48:08,000 --> 00:48:09,000
Publish that map.

740
00:48:09,000 --> 00:48:11,000
That map would give zero stars.

741
00:48:11,000 --> 00:48:16,000
And people would tell me like how much I like suck.

742
00:48:16,000 --> 00:48:19,000
What's the 100 Mario challenge?

743
00:48:19,000 --> 00:48:27,000
I just want to take a look at it and see what it is.

744
00:48:27,000 --> 00:48:33,000
100 Mario challenge.

745
00:48:33,000 --> 00:48:36,000
You get 100 lives to clear 8 courses.

746
00:48:36,000 --> 00:48:41,000
Take on different courses every time you play from makers all around the world.

747
00:48:41,000 --> 00:48:44,000
Sounds straightforward enough.

748
00:48:44,000 --> 00:48:47,000
Oh, they give me 100 lives.

749
00:48:47,000 --> 00:48:48,000
I don't know.

750
00:48:48,000 --> 00:48:54,000
You saw how much of a catastrophe the last time I tried to play like the more...

751
00:48:54,000 --> 00:49:00,000
I'm not sure if I can make it.

752
00:49:00,000 --> 00:49:01,000
They give me 100 lives.

753
00:49:01,000 --> 00:49:09,000
I'm not sure if I can make it.

754
00:49:09,000 --> 00:49:14,000
I'm not sure if I can make it.

755
00:49:14,000 --> 00:49:22,000
I'm not sure if I can make it.

756
00:49:22,000 --> 00:49:26,000
I thought you could fly around on those things.

757
00:49:26,000 --> 00:49:29,000
There's got to be something in one of these.

758
00:49:29,000 --> 00:49:32,000
You wouldn't put these all here.

759
00:49:32,000 --> 00:49:38,000
You wouldn't like these all that without something.

760
00:49:38,000 --> 00:49:43,000
Is that a fireball?

761
00:49:43,000 --> 00:49:48,000
Is it a fireball coming right at me?

762
00:49:48,000 --> 00:49:55,000
Oh, he shoots it down.

763
00:49:55,000 --> 00:49:56,000
Oh, whatever.

764
00:49:56,000 --> 00:49:57,000
What is going to skip that?

765
00:49:57,000 --> 00:49:59,000
This is a big smiley face.

766
00:49:59,000 --> 00:50:05,000
You can go in them.

767
00:50:05,000 --> 00:50:06,000
Is that Bowser?

768
00:50:06,000 --> 00:50:14,000
That was Bowser and Bowser Jr.

769
00:50:14,000 --> 00:50:16,000
Of course, it's too difficult.

770
00:50:16,000 --> 00:50:23,000
I'm not sure if I can make it.

771
00:50:23,000 --> 00:50:27,000
It's giving me the use suck.

772
00:50:27,000 --> 00:50:30,000
Please don't hurt yourself in Mara.

773
00:50:30,000 --> 00:50:33,000
Don't like strain yourself.

774
00:50:33,000 --> 00:50:39,000
It's like bumper cards.

775
00:50:39,000 --> 00:50:41,000
This is impossible to do somebody said,

776
00:50:41,000 --> 00:50:44,000
okay, we'll be the impossible.

777
00:50:44,000 --> 00:50:47,000
The impossible loss.

778
00:50:47,000 --> 00:50:48,000
Is it safe and quit?

779
00:50:48,000 --> 00:50:49,000
For what?

780
00:50:49,000 --> 00:50:56,000
Just in case you can't do it anymore?

781
00:50:56,000 --> 00:50:58,000
For ten levels, hundred lives.

782
00:50:58,000 --> 00:51:00,000
That seems like a lot.

783
00:51:00,000 --> 00:51:01,000
Holy shit, I thought those were gopies.

784
00:51:01,000 --> 00:51:07,000
What is happening to my character?

785
00:51:07,000 --> 00:51:09,000
What?

786
00:51:09,000 --> 00:51:11,000
How do you figure this shit out?

787
00:51:11,000 --> 00:51:16,000
The game is a little bit off like a week.

788
00:51:16,000 --> 00:51:23,000
Get up there.

789
00:51:23,000 --> 00:51:26,000
What?

790
00:51:26,000 --> 00:51:29,000
Is it like a beanstalk?

791
00:51:29,000 --> 00:51:36,000
I'm not sure if I can do it.

792
00:51:36,000 --> 00:51:40,000
There you go.

793
00:51:40,000 --> 00:51:45,000
I was wondering why the fuck that was an awesome level.

794
00:51:45,000 --> 00:51:53,000
I wish I could give that one two thumbs up.

795
00:51:53,000 --> 00:51:58,000
Oh boy.

796
00:51:58,000 --> 00:52:03,000
Get out of my way.

797
00:52:03,000 --> 00:52:08,000
I feel like I made this level.

798
00:52:08,000 --> 00:52:11,000
Okay.

799
00:52:11,000 --> 00:52:17,000
Well, that was pretty good one too.

800
00:52:17,000 --> 00:52:22,000
Where were these before?

801
00:52:22,000 --> 00:52:29,000
I feel like I found the jackpot of dumb goofy levels that I wanted to find.

802
00:52:29,000 --> 00:52:41,000
So, why hate the water levels?

803
00:52:41,000 --> 00:52:44,000
Give me like 98 lives.

804
00:52:44,000 --> 00:52:47,000
I'm scared to go and get it.

805
00:52:47,000 --> 00:52:48,000
More important.

806
00:52:48,000 --> 00:52:49,000
Whatever.

807
00:52:49,000 --> 00:52:54,000
It didn't even matter.

808
00:52:54,000 --> 00:53:05,000
These levels of the people just spam the enemies everywhere.

809
00:53:05,000 --> 00:53:07,000
This is easy.

810
00:53:07,000 --> 00:53:08,000
This is easy.

811
00:53:08,000 --> 00:53:09,000
This is really easy.

812
00:53:09,000 --> 00:53:10,000
Why would I even go up?

813
00:53:10,000 --> 00:53:11,000
I'm not going to go up though.

814
00:53:11,000 --> 00:53:16,000
It would be a terrible mistake.

815
00:53:16,000 --> 00:53:21,000
This is Mario Maker.

816
00:53:21,000 --> 00:53:25,000
This is very long.

817
00:53:25,000 --> 00:53:26,000
Okay.

818
00:53:26,000 --> 00:53:30,000
This is kind of scary to me a little bit now.

819
00:53:30,000 --> 00:53:32,000
What are the cannons for?

820
00:53:32,000 --> 00:53:36,000
They're just shooting them out.

821
00:53:36,000 --> 00:53:42,000
Why is this so long?

822
00:53:42,000 --> 00:53:43,000
Okay.

823
00:53:43,000 --> 00:53:47,000
Now I understand why those ones that were featured were featured because people make hallways

824
00:53:47,000 --> 00:53:52,000
with spammed monsters.

825
00:53:52,000 --> 00:53:53,000
Yeah.

826
00:53:53,000 --> 00:54:00,000
Why would you even go up there?

827
00:54:00,000 --> 00:54:01,000
Unimpossible.

828
00:54:01,000 --> 00:54:02,000
Yeah.

829
00:54:02,000 --> 00:54:07,000
That was an unimpossible level.

830
00:54:07,000 --> 00:54:14,000
Still have 100 lives.

831
00:54:14,000 --> 00:54:18,000
What do you know guys?

832
00:54:18,000 --> 00:54:22,000
Here's another fucking nightmare level.

833
00:54:22,000 --> 00:54:25,000
I'm not even going to get it.

834
00:54:25,000 --> 00:54:32,000
It's hurting my eyes.

835
00:54:32,000 --> 00:54:34,000
This level is going to be a headache.

836
00:54:34,000 --> 00:54:36,000
The star is here too.

837
00:54:36,000 --> 00:54:41,000
Well already then.

838
00:54:41,000 --> 00:54:48,000
It's just a gool person.

839
00:54:48,000 --> 00:54:53,000
What the fucking bow is at the end?

840
00:54:53,000 --> 00:55:00,000
This probably took the person a long time because every space is a coin.

841
00:55:00,000 --> 00:55:05,000
Just go this way.

842
00:55:05,000 --> 00:55:11,000
I don't know.

843
00:55:11,000 --> 00:55:15,000
I guess I don't know what to do.

844
00:55:15,000 --> 00:55:19,000
Who needs them up to?

845
00:55:19,000 --> 00:55:22,000
Did it win?

846
00:55:22,000 --> 00:55:25,000
Did it win?

847
00:55:25,000 --> 00:55:30,000
Did it win?

848
00:55:30,000 --> 00:55:43,000
It's the star bait got him.

849
00:55:43,000 --> 00:55:50,000
So random levels, you're probably going to 90% of the time get weird ones like that.

850
00:55:50,000 --> 00:55:54,000
This one's different.

851
00:55:54,000 --> 00:55:58,000
Let's see what the difference is here.

852
00:55:59,000 --> 00:56:02,000
Those doors.

853
00:56:02,000 --> 00:56:05,000
You got to have Bowser in your level.

854
00:56:05,000 --> 00:56:11,000
He's just in here.

855
00:56:11,000 --> 00:56:15,000
Make sure there's at least a boy.

856
00:56:15,000 --> 00:56:19,000
Give him credit for that one.

857
00:56:19,000 --> 00:56:27,000
I wish I had any idea how to actually attack Bowser.

858
00:56:27,000 --> 00:56:30,000
I don't think I know how.

859
00:56:30,000 --> 00:56:34,000
That's the trigger buttons.

860
00:56:34,000 --> 00:56:45,000
Gosh, you sure are great at this game.

861
00:56:45,000 --> 00:56:50,000
Halfway through and you still have 100 lives.

862
00:56:50,000 --> 00:56:53,000
I don't know, Star.

863
00:56:53,000 --> 00:56:58,000
I don't know, but I guess I can.

864
00:56:58,000 --> 00:57:06,000
Maybe in the older Mario games.

865
00:57:06,000 --> 00:57:14,000
Get inside of the clown guy.

866
00:57:14,000 --> 00:57:18,000
Yeah, make sure to go down and over and up.

867
00:57:18,000 --> 00:57:22,000
I really enjoyed putting these arrows down.

868
00:57:22,000 --> 00:57:25,000
Where is this take really?

869
00:57:25,000 --> 00:57:28,000
Really?

870
00:57:28,000 --> 00:57:31,000
Hold on.

871
00:57:31,000 --> 00:57:35,000
He made this whole elaborate level.

872
00:57:35,000 --> 00:57:38,000
You just to be able to skip the entire thing?

873
00:57:38,000 --> 00:57:41,000
Look at how this worked this guy put in.

874
00:57:41,000 --> 00:57:47,000
All for seemingly no reason.

875
00:57:47,000 --> 00:57:50,000
Yeah.

876
00:57:50,000 --> 00:57:53,000
This is just all for show.

877
00:57:53,000 --> 00:57:56,000
This is all for you to look at.

878
00:57:56,000 --> 00:57:59,000
Okay.

879
00:57:59,000 --> 00:58:02,000
Can I?

880
00:58:02,000 --> 00:58:05,000
No, I can't even go down in here.

881
00:58:05,000 --> 00:58:07,000
Sweet.

882
00:58:07,000 --> 00:58:10,000
I beat it.

883
00:58:10,000 --> 00:58:15,000
Goomba torture chamber.

884
00:58:15,000 --> 00:58:17,000
Maybe we can...

885
00:58:18,000 --> 00:58:20,000
Maybe go final level.

886
00:58:20,000 --> 00:58:27,000
I only have 100 attempts to beat this last level, guys.

887
00:58:27,000 --> 00:58:32,000
At least a different game.

888
00:58:32,000 --> 00:58:39,000
Let them over there.

889
00:58:39,000 --> 00:58:42,000
Hey, will I ask for the easy grandpa levels?

890
00:58:42,000 --> 00:58:46,000
These are definitely the easy grandpa levels.

891
00:58:47,000 --> 00:58:51,000
Oh, Bowser's over here.

892
00:58:51,000 --> 00:58:54,000
That's a very strange Bowser.

893
00:58:54,000 --> 00:58:58,000
What game is that Bowser from?

894
00:58:58,000 --> 00:59:01,000
What game is this Bowser from?

895
00:59:01,000 --> 00:59:02,000
I'm like...

896
00:59:02,000 --> 00:59:05,000
It's flabbergasted right now.

897
00:59:05,000 --> 00:59:06,000
Whatever.

898
00:59:06,000 --> 00:59:09,000
Oh, you can't go through it.

899
00:59:09,000 --> 00:59:14,000
Is that like a DS Bowser?

900
00:59:14,000 --> 00:59:17,000
This is... I can't lose this.

901
00:59:17,000 --> 00:59:19,000
It just spits these flowers out over and over again.

902
00:59:19,000 --> 00:59:24,000
I might as well just stand here and just tap as fast as I can.

903
00:59:24,000 --> 00:59:31,000
I did it.

904
00:59:31,000 --> 00:59:35,000
So, I beat the 100 Mario Challenge.

905
00:59:35,000 --> 00:59:42,000
What do I get?

906
00:59:42,000 --> 00:59:45,000
Does no Bowser like that in any game?

907
00:59:45,000 --> 00:59:51,000
I feel like that's from like an RPG DS game or something.

908
00:59:51,000 --> 00:59:56,000
Can I skip this?

909
00:59:56,000 --> 00:59:59,000
Yeah, I'll do the normal version.

910
00:59:59,000 --> 01:00:05,000
That sounds like a better idea.

911
01:00:05,000 --> 01:00:13,000
Of course, design.

912
01:00:13,000 --> 01:00:16,000
What are Japanese?

913
01:00:16,000 --> 01:00:19,000
Most of those levels are made by Japanese.

914
01:00:19,000 --> 01:00:21,000
It's kind of cool.

915
01:00:21,000 --> 01:00:22,000
It's worldwide.

916
01:00:22,000 --> 01:00:24,000
It's worldwide, guys.

917
01:00:24,000 --> 01:00:30,000
New mystery mushroom costume?

918
01:00:30,000 --> 01:00:33,000
Cool.

919
01:00:33,000 --> 01:00:37,000
All right, normal.

920
01:00:37,000 --> 01:00:40,000
So, that's on normal.

921
01:00:40,000 --> 01:00:50,000
We'll do a game on normal.

922
01:00:50,000 --> 01:00:53,000
So, this one has more levels.

923
01:00:53,000 --> 01:00:55,000
Interesting.

924
01:00:55,000 --> 01:01:02,000
Interesting.

925
01:01:02,000 --> 01:01:06,000
Kuku land.

926
01:01:06,000 --> 01:01:09,000
But this is where it actually is.

927
01:01:09,000 --> 01:01:11,000
This is where it's going to get hard.

928
01:01:11,000 --> 01:01:12,000
Probably.

929
01:01:12,000 --> 01:01:22,000
Maybe.

930
01:01:22,000 --> 01:01:23,000
Maybe not.

931
01:01:23,000 --> 01:01:29,000
Seems pretty standard.

932
01:01:29,000 --> 01:01:32,000
I think it's going to fly.

933
01:01:32,000 --> 01:01:35,000
Oh, my goodness.

934
01:01:35,000 --> 01:01:37,000
What a troll.

935
01:01:37,000 --> 01:01:41,000
Just go over him.

936
01:01:41,000 --> 01:01:42,000
I knew it.

937
01:01:42,000 --> 01:01:43,000
I knew it.

938
01:01:43,000 --> 01:01:45,000
I knew there was going to be something in there.

939
01:01:45,000 --> 01:01:52,000
There's gigantic ones.

940
01:01:52,000 --> 01:01:53,000
Can I go up?

941
01:01:53,000 --> 01:01:55,000
I'm going to go up in the room.

942
01:01:55,000 --> 01:01:58,000
Rain hell on them from above.

943
01:01:58,000 --> 01:02:02,000
At least this is like an actual level.

944
01:02:02,000 --> 01:02:11,000
I'm going to get stuck down there if I go down there on I.

945
01:02:11,000 --> 01:02:19,000
This one's longer, too.

946
01:02:19,000 --> 01:02:22,000
And there we go.

947
01:02:22,000 --> 01:02:34,000
So, what after you do this, you unlock hard?

948
01:02:34,000 --> 01:02:43,000
Is that how it works?

949
01:02:43,000 --> 01:02:50,000
Let me listen in.

950
01:02:50,000 --> 01:03:01,000
And we'll sync my own stream.

951
01:03:01,000 --> 01:03:05,000
How bad is the delay?

952
01:03:05,000 --> 01:03:08,000
I thought I had that in the fence.

953
01:03:08,000 --> 01:03:17,000
This is actually somewhat on the more nuanced side.

954
01:03:17,000 --> 01:03:21,000
I just looked down at the chat and I was just sunk to my death.

955
01:03:21,000 --> 01:03:30,000
Oh, great.

956
01:03:30,000 --> 01:03:35,000
Of course I wouldn't have the worst one possible running into like, oh, I was on his head.

957
01:03:35,000 --> 01:03:41,000
I was running his head.

958
01:03:41,000 --> 01:03:50,000
That's baloney.

959
01:03:50,000 --> 01:03:55,000
Yeah, I thought it's a one second delay, but I thought I fixed that in OBS.

960
01:03:55,000 --> 01:04:01,000
I guess not though.

961
01:04:01,000 --> 01:04:05,000
Get away from me.

962
01:04:05,000 --> 01:04:06,000
Damn.

963
01:04:06,000 --> 01:04:10,000
That's just making it worse.

964
01:04:10,000 --> 01:04:15,000
What you up with the bullets?

965
01:04:15,000 --> 01:04:17,000
I actually don't even, shouldn't have even gotten that mushroom.

966
01:04:17,000 --> 01:04:20,000
Just go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go.

967
01:04:20,000 --> 01:04:22,000
Well, you have a second.

968
01:04:22,000 --> 01:04:24,000
Oh, come on.

969
01:04:24,000 --> 01:04:27,000
Fuck.

970
01:04:27,000 --> 01:04:37,000
I have plenty of lives.

971
01:04:37,000 --> 01:04:39,000
I'm gonna go on the top one this time.

972
01:04:43,000 --> 01:04:45,000
Fuck, I got too itchy.

973
01:04:55,000 --> 01:04:59,000
Yeah, because bringing in console footage,

974
01:04:59,000 --> 01:05:04,000
it takes like three seconds or so before it actually gets to the computer.

975
01:05:04,000 --> 01:05:09,000
So you end up having to go in and do all kinds of weird audio delays.

976
01:05:09,000 --> 01:05:12,000
And I thought I ended up doing it right, but apparently not.

977
01:05:15,000 --> 01:05:20,000
Oh boy, that's super annoying. It just launches you up. You can't touch them.

978
01:05:29,000 --> 01:05:31,000
Alright, I'm gonna be careful here.

979
01:05:35,000 --> 01:05:37,000
Ah, I did it again. My hand just like...

980
01:05:46,000 --> 01:05:49,000
No, I was looking at chat. I shouldn't be doing that.

981
01:05:53,000 --> 01:05:55,000
I got plenty of lives. I'm okay.

982
01:05:56,000 --> 01:05:58,000
I'm playing fucking flappy bird.

983
01:06:09,000 --> 01:06:11,000
No, I can't miss it again.

984
01:06:16,000 --> 01:06:20,000
Wow. I'm just gonna skip that mushroom entirely.

985
01:06:20,000 --> 01:06:24,000
The bounce back from that mushroom ends up just launching around like a fucking...

986
01:06:25,000 --> 01:06:26,000
...pinball.

987
01:06:31,000 --> 01:06:37,000
It's a good idea to get it, but I think if you just try to swim through it, it should be okay.

988
01:06:39,000 --> 01:06:41,000
Well, you know what? I'll just bait him.

989
01:06:43,000 --> 01:06:45,000
We'll take it slow.

990
01:06:47,000 --> 01:06:48,000
There we go.

991
01:06:49,000 --> 01:06:51,000
Come on, come on over here.

992
01:06:56,000 --> 01:06:57,000
I love how they split into two.

993
01:07:03,000 --> 01:07:04,000
Ugh!

994
01:07:07,000 --> 01:07:10,000
Damn it. Damn it, damn it, damn it, damn it.

995
01:07:10,000 --> 01:07:12,000
Now, how come the bullets?

996
01:07:13,000 --> 01:07:15,000
I did not know that hit me.

997
01:07:15,000 --> 01:07:21,000
I did not... Okay, go to know the hit detection because that was like an inch away from touching me.

998
01:07:21,000 --> 01:07:22,000
Unfortunately.

999
01:07:22,000 --> 01:07:25,000
Oh my god.

1000
01:07:42,000 --> 01:07:43,000
Hundred Mario's.

1001
01:07:44,000 --> 01:07:45,000
One hundred of them.

1002
01:07:53,000 --> 01:07:57,000
I don't want to touch that mushroom till at least these two are gone.

1003
01:08:01,000 --> 01:08:03,000
We'll actually hit his head, I will.

1004
01:08:03,000 --> 01:08:04,000
Okay, good.

1005
01:08:08,000 --> 01:08:11,000
All right. Much better shaped than before.

1006
01:08:15,000 --> 01:08:16,000
Dear.

1007
01:08:17,000 --> 01:08:19,000
Much out for the bullet.

1008
01:08:21,000 --> 01:08:23,000
Much out for the bullet.

1009
01:08:30,000 --> 01:08:33,000
Oh, they really want to want you around, huh?

1010
01:08:35,000 --> 01:08:38,000
That is... That's some shit right there.

1011
01:08:43,000 --> 01:08:44,000
Damn.

1012
01:08:47,000 --> 01:08:50,000
Those shoot on a very long delay.

1013
01:08:51,000 --> 01:08:52,000
Oh, come on.

1014
01:09:00,000 --> 01:09:02,000
Get me out of there.

1015
01:09:02,000 --> 01:09:04,000
Oh, fuck you.

1016
01:09:07,000 --> 01:09:08,000
Please!

1017
01:09:08,000 --> 01:09:17,000
Whoa! Whoa! I did not know that happened. Fuck.

1018
01:09:17,000 --> 01:09:21,000
Can't this level's over? This level's hard.

1019
01:09:21,000 --> 01:09:23,000
Where's the checkpoints?

1020
01:09:25,000 --> 01:09:26,000
No, just wait.

1021
01:09:26,000 --> 01:09:30,000
Don't do anything stupid. You're already here. Those things can go through goddamn walls.

1022
01:09:30,000 --> 01:09:33,000
Come on, come on. Move, move.

1023
01:09:34,000 --> 01:09:35,000
Yes.

1024
01:09:35,000 --> 01:09:36,000
Finally.

1025
01:09:39,000 --> 01:09:41,000
Woof!

1026
01:09:44,000 --> 01:09:48,000
Yeah, I wonder if I can... Let's see if I can do it from here.

1027
01:09:48,000 --> 01:09:51,000
Let me see how many milliseconds it is.

1028
01:10:05,000 --> 01:10:07,000
All right, I'll try something in a minute here.

1029
01:10:09,000 --> 01:10:13,000
Once I go through this, I'll try it again.

1030
01:10:13,000 --> 01:10:16,000
Doing different... Different tactic.

1031
01:10:21,000 --> 01:10:24,000
Don't know what this item does. I didn't play this game.

1032
01:10:24,000 --> 01:10:27,000
So we're gonna figure it out right now.

1033
01:10:27,000 --> 01:10:29,000
To me, this looks like a propeller.

1034
01:10:30,000 --> 01:10:32,000
Okay, that's what it does.

1035
01:10:39,000 --> 01:10:41,000
Still floating.

1036
01:10:44,000 --> 01:10:47,000
What the hell am I? Well, of course.

1037
01:10:55,000 --> 01:10:58,000
I thought I landed on him, but I didn't...

1038
01:10:58,000 --> 01:11:02,000
So I had to just try to go too fast. I had to try to rush like crazy.

1039
01:11:04,000 --> 01:11:07,000
I got to the end there. I got stuck up top.

1040
01:11:07,000 --> 01:11:10,000
I didn't know what the hell I even was. That's a blue that one.

1041
01:11:14,000 --> 01:11:18,000
Is there way just to fall fast with this or no? You just always gonna do that?

1042
01:11:22,000 --> 01:11:24,000
That's why it's dangerous to use it.

1043
01:11:26,000 --> 01:11:27,000
Okay.

1044
01:11:29,000 --> 01:11:33,000
I think I can hit this guy when he jumps up. Jump up again.

1045
01:11:34,000 --> 01:11:38,000
Maybe he just spawned. That's probably what happened.

1046
01:11:41,000 --> 01:11:44,000
Getting too greedy with those jumps.

1047
01:11:48,000 --> 01:11:51,000
Just... Wait, I was waiting for a debounce back.

1048
01:11:53,000 --> 01:11:57,000
Holy shit. That was... Good thing I got hit.

1049
01:12:04,000 --> 01:12:08,000
Mario time.

1050
01:12:08,000 --> 01:12:11,000
You can do the ground pound. Okay, cool.

1051
01:12:17,000 --> 01:12:20,000
All right. Mario three.

1052
01:12:27,000 --> 01:12:31,000
Cool. We have a multi-layered, multi-level. Let's go.

1053
01:12:34,000 --> 01:12:38,000
I'm gonna have to utilize those.

1054
01:12:43,000 --> 01:12:46,000
Beanstalk.

1055
01:12:46,000 --> 01:12:50,000
Oh, shit. I should have jumped.

1056
01:12:52,000 --> 01:12:56,000
Not sure for the fucking assholes that throw the wrenches.

1057
01:12:56,000 --> 01:12:59,000
Oh, come on. Come on now.

1058
01:13:04,000 --> 01:13:06,000
Yeah.

1059
01:13:12,000 --> 01:13:15,000
Screw you.

1060
01:13:18,000 --> 01:13:21,000
Is that a shoe?

1061
01:13:21,000 --> 01:13:24,000
It's like a high heel.

1062
01:13:30,000 --> 01:13:32,000
What else is going on here?

1063
01:13:33,000 --> 01:13:36,000
Oh, that might be a mushroom.

1064
01:13:36,000 --> 01:13:38,000
It is, in fact. It is a mushroom.

1065
01:13:38,000 --> 01:13:42,000
It might not be a mushroom, but one of these things.

1066
01:13:44,000 --> 01:13:47,000
What is happening here?

1067
01:13:47,000 --> 01:13:50,000
That's the... You gotta go there. Right when it ends.

1068
01:13:50,000 --> 01:13:53,000
So, right.

1069
01:13:59,000 --> 01:14:02,000
It gives a shit about coins. We're trying to like meet the level.

1070
01:14:04,000 --> 01:14:06,000
This is a really good one.

1071
01:14:06,000 --> 01:14:10,000
This is a really good... This is a really dangerous one too though.

1072
01:14:10,000 --> 01:14:12,000
Oh, damn it.

1073
01:14:12,000 --> 01:14:15,000
I had to go up and around and I...

1074
01:14:15,000 --> 01:14:18,000
No, I didn't. What?

1075
01:14:18,000 --> 01:14:21,000
I'm invincible.

1076
01:14:22,000 --> 01:14:25,000
What am I missing here?

1077
01:14:25,000 --> 01:14:28,000
Oh, shit. Right there.

1078
01:14:29,000 --> 01:14:33,000
You gotta be getting close to the end.

1079
01:14:39,000 --> 01:14:44,000
Yeah, you can wear those boots. Yeah, you can. I remember that.

1080
01:14:45,000 --> 01:14:47,000
I will remember that for next time.

1081
01:14:47,000 --> 01:14:50,000
Shit, go!

1082
01:14:50,000 --> 01:14:55,000
The door was right there. I should have waited.

1083
01:14:55,000 --> 01:14:58,000
Oh, that one was tough.

1084
01:14:58,000 --> 01:15:03,000
That one was tough. That was not... That was not simple.

1085
01:15:05,000 --> 01:15:09,000
Alright, get it together here. Let's go.

1086
01:15:17,000 --> 01:15:19,000
Who cares about the Beanstalk?

1087
01:15:19,000 --> 01:15:23,000
Oh, you need to go on the Beanstalk, I think.

1088
01:15:24,000 --> 01:15:28,000
Boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom.

1089
01:15:28,000 --> 01:15:31,000
Somebody bullets.

1090
01:15:34,000 --> 01:15:37,000
Oh, it wasn't up yet.

1091
01:15:37,000 --> 01:15:41,000
Well, that's just too bad.

1092
01:15:46,000 --> 01:15:49,000
You know, it's kind of deceiving. The stuff like blends in with the wall.

1093
01:15:49,000 --> 01:15:52,000
I think I can go through these sometimes, but I can't.

1094
01:15:52,000 --> 01:15:59,000
Let's take a shoe this time. It's gonna get... It's gonna get the killed without a doubt, but let's go in the shoe.

1095
01:16:00,000 --> 01:16:04,000
This is not a good idea. The shoe is a bad idea.

1096
01:16:04,000 --> 01:16:08,000
I already don't like the idea of having the shoe on.

1097
01:16:09,000 --> 01:16:13,000
Can I just crush these things? These are like a step on these guys.

1098
01:16:14,000 --> 01:16:21,000
Does it keep you protected? Maybe I feel more confident inside the shoe.

1099
01:16:28,000 --> 01:16:31,000
Holy shit.

1100
01:16:33,000 --> 01:16:36,000
Don't throw that at me.

1101
01:16:37,000 --> 01:16:40,000
Get in.

1102
01:16:40,000 --> 01:16:43,000
There's even more. There's more to this.

1103
01:16:44,000 --> 01:16:47,000
I don't know what enemies down there. I don't know what to do.

1104
01:16:47,000 --> 01:16:51,000
I don't know how to fight that thing. I don't know what to do. Okay, stuns you. He does a stun.

1105
01:16:51,000 --> 01:16:54,000
You have to jump in the air. I'm assuming, right?

1106
01:16:55,000 --> 01:17:00,000
Okay, yeah, I remember these... Holy fucking dog shit in my mouth.

1107
01:17:05,000 --> 01:17:08,000
Okay, we're good.

1108
01:17:11,000 --> 01:17:17,000
Something's... something ain't right here.

1109
01:17:20,000 --> 01:17:24,000
Something's not right here. I'm gonna get one of these.

1110
01:17:24,000 --> 01:17:28,000
I can't blow this. I cannot blow this.

1111
01:17:30,000 --> 01:17:34,000
Don't blow it. I blew it.

1112
01:17:40,000 --> 01:17:45,000
I fucking blew it.

1113
01:17:57,000 --> 01:18:01,000
I'm like actually upset right now. Does it reset?

1114
01:18:02,000 --> 01:18:05,000
Thank God.

1115
01:18:06,000 --> 01:18:12,000
Oh, he resets to fuck fuck no. No!

1116
01:18:15,000 --> 01:18:20,000
I'm gonna die and it's all because I had to blow it. I'm just gonna throw him down there.

1117
01:18:22,000 --> 01:18:25,000
That's such diarrhea.

1118
01:18:27,000 --> 01:18:31,000
If I just toss him down there, what happens? What just happened to me? Go get him.

1119
01:18:32,000 --> 01:18:34,000
Did I get him?

1120
01:18:35,000 --> 01:18:40,000
No, I didn't. You just do it. You break it.

1121
01:18:40,000 --> 01:18:44,000
I have 86 seconds. Come on. Do you think we break everything?

1122
01:18:44,000 --> 01:18:48,000
Come on. Smash it all up.

1123
01:18:53,000 --> 01:18:58,000
I can't believe that happened. That's seriously. So that's so depressing.

1124
01:18:58,000 --> 01:19:03,000
After all that, that was like... That was a good run. I actually got through that one. That was tough wood.

1125
01:19:04,000 --> 01:19:08,000
I walked... I like...

1126
01:19:08,000 --> 01:19:12,000
I'm not a pain in the ass.

1127
01:19:12,000 --> 01:19:17,000
This game. Dude, who made this level? Props to you. This is fucking awesome.

1128
01:19:17,000 --> 01:19:21,000
I gotta make one of these.

1129
01:19:22,000 --> 01:19:27,000
At least I've gotten somewhat used to this weird delay I have.

1130
01:19:27,000 --> 01:19:31,000
It was definitely a terrible idea to do those very difficult levels first.

1131
01:19:31,000 --> 01:19:34,000
Without having playing Mario for like five years.

1132
01:19:34,000 --> 01:19:39,000
Shit, give me the shoe.

1133
01:19:40,000 --> 01:19:44,000
Give me this.

1134
01:19:44,000 --> 01:19:48,000
I'm feel a little bit safer now. This time don't fuck it up.

1135
01:19:48,000 --> 01:19:52,000
Like a dickhead.

1136
01:19:52,000 --> 01:19:57,000
You know what a really cool part about this game really is?

1137
01:19:57,000 --> 01:20:02,000
If you're a fan of Mario games, you're just like never-ending content.

1138
01:20:02,000 --> 01:20:07,000
You can play Mario games forever.

1139
01:20:13,000 --> 01:20:19,000
Easy. Easy now. Easy now.

1140
01:20:23,000 --> 01:20:27,000
Shit. Let's go.

1141
01:20:27,000 --> 01:20:34,000
This time, do not screw this up.

1142
01:20:35,000 --> 01:20:40,000
Holy shit. What the fuck? Oh my god. Hit it.

1143
01:20:40,000 --> 01:20:45,000
Did I win? I won.

1144
01:20:45,000 --> 01:20:56,000
I'm silent now. I'm just gonna silently beat this.

1145
01:20:57,000 --> 01:21:02,000
How was I supposed to know that's what was gonna happen?

1146
01:21:02,000 --> 01:21:08,000
I didn't know there was one little tiny little dickhead.

1147
01:21:08,000 --> 01:21:13,000
I'm not gonna be able to do that.

1148
01:21:13,000 --> 01:21:19,000
I'm not gonna be able to do that.

1149
01:21:19,000 --> 01:21:23,000
I'm not gonna be able to do that.

1150
01:21:24,000 --> 01:21:28,000
A dickhead plant in my way.

1151
01:21:28,000 --> 01:21:31,000
And now I'm getting sloppy.

1152
01:21:31,000 --> 01:21:35,000
I'm just gonna get them getting a little irritable.

1153
01:21:35,000 --> 01:21:38,000
But who gives a fuck? Just go.

1154
01:21:38,000 --> 01:21:41,000
Don't even need the shoe.

1155
01:21:47,000 --> 01:21:51,000
Oh, eat my fucking butthole.

1156
01:21:51,000 --> 01:21:54,000
Fucking love.

1157
01:21:54,000 --> 01:21:57,000
Come on, this is gonna be another one.

1158
01:21:57,000 --> 01:22:01,000
Yes, come on. One of you has to have one.

1159
01:22:01,000 --> 01:22:05,000
You do.

1160
01:22:05,000 --> 01:22:09,000
At least I'm completing the levels.

1161
01:22:09,000 --> 01:22:15,000
Give me some credit for that one.

1162
01:22:16,000 --> 01:22:22,000
This one I can't slow down here.

1163
01:22:22,000 --> 01:22:26,000
Now I just go.

1164
01:22:26,000 --> 01:22:32,000
Now that I know that that's there, I essentially can just skip this whole thing.

1165
01:22:32,000 --> 01:22:35,000
Right? Like if I just press this and just go down the tube, right?

1166
01:22:35,000 --> 01:22:37,000
That's what we're doing.

1167
01:22:37,000 --> 01:22:42,000
Go right down the tube.

1168
01:22:42,000 --> 01:22:45,000
You punk, you fucking piece of shit.

1169
01:22:45,000 --> 01:22:48,000
God.

1170
01:22:48,000 --> 01:22:50,000
I don't know what's down here.

1171
01:22:50,000 --> 01:22:53,000
Don't like, please don't be a whole.

1172
01:22:53,000 --> 01:23:00,000
It's over. I did it.

1173
01:23:00,000 --> 01:23:03,000
Whew, that was a good level.

1174
01:23:03,000 --> 01:23:05,000
That was a very good level.

1175
01:23:05,000 --> 01:23:08,000
I commend that guy.

1176
01:23:08,000 --> 01:23:11,000
That was really, really cool.

1177
01:23:11,000 --> 01:23:18,000
Let's keep going.

1178
01:23:18,000 --> 01:23:25,000
What do you say, huh?

1179
01:23:25,000 --> 01:23:36,000
Another one of these regular new Super Mario brothers, we, we, we, we.

1180
01:23:36,000 --> 01:23:40,000
I don't like this one already.

1181
01:23:40,000 --> 01:23:42,000
Don't ask me how I'm alive from that.

1182
01:23:42,000 --> 01:23:43,000
I don't know how I stayed alive.

1183
01:23:43,000 --> 01:23:48,000
I don't have any idea.

1184
01:23:48,000 --> 01:23:53,000
What is this level that you've created?

1185
01:23:53,000 --> 01:23:57,000
No, you don't, don't, no.

1186
01:23:57,000 --> 01:24:01,000
Can I not get out of here?

1187
01:24:01,000 --> 01:24:09,000
This dude has made a level you just get trapped inside.

1188
01:24:09,000 --> 01:24:13,000
Okay.

1189
01:24:13,000 --> 01:24:16,000
Let's sit here and just pray.

1190
01:24:16,000 --> 01:24:22,000
I'm just gonna wait for the chat to tell me I have to like press up down left right in like in like smash through.

1191
01:24:22,000 --> 01:24:25,000
Yeah, I just got, I just got baited.

1192
01:24:25,000 --> 01:24:32,000
Okay, let's restart.

1193
01:24:32,000 --> 01:24:35,000
I can't, can I not?

1194
01:24:35,000 --> 01:24:37,000
I don't, no, I don't think you can cry.

1195
01:24:37,000 --> 01:24:41,000
I'm too big.

1196
01:24:41,000 --> 01:24:42,000
I'm not gonna sit here.

1197
01:24:42,000 --> 01:24:43,000
It was start over.

1198
01:24:43,000 --> 01:24:49,000
Just whatever.

1199
01:24:49,000 --> 01:24:51,000
I still have 92 lives.

1200
01:24:51,000 --> 01:24:55,000
This is not, this is not going as terrible as I thought it was going to go.

1201
01:24:55,000 --> 01:24:58,000
Be careful.

1202
01:24:58,000 --> 01:25:01,000
Too much, too much air.

1203
01:25:01,000 --> 01:25:04,000
Now that's the mushroom I can probably get, right?

1204
01:25:04,000 --> 01:25:09,000
I go down here and then slowly, can I make this jump?

1205
01:25:09,000 --> 01:25:11,000
Oh, eat.

1206
01:25:11,000 --> 01:25:17,000
I was trying to do the jump off that shit.

1207
01:25:17,000 --> 01:25:18,000
You know what?

1208
01:25:18,000 --> 01:25:20,000
I think they're all baits.

1209
01:25:20,000 --> 01:25:21,000
I really do.

1210
01:25:21,000 --> 01:25:23,000
I think everyone who use mushroom is a bait.

1211
01:25:23,000 --> 01:25:29,000
So we're just not, we're gonna ignore them.

1212
01:25:29,000 --> 01:25:35,000
I just squeezed my eyes closed after that.

1213
01:25:35,000 --> 01:25:43,000
How do I get that the first time?

1214
01:25:43,000 --> 01:25:46,000
That's much safer to do it like that.

1215
01:25:46,000 --> 01:25:51,000
So if I don't get that mushroom, I just go over it.

1216
01:25:51,000 --> 01:25:53,000
I can get that one, can I?

1217
01:25:53,000 --> 01:25:55,000
Or can I not?

1218
01:25:55,000 --> 01:25:57,000
If I get stuck in here, I swear.

1219
01:25:57,000 --> 01:26:05,000
Okay, now I'm good.

1220
01:26:05,000 --> 01:26:08,000
All right, let's continue on.

1221
01:26:08,000 --> 01:26:13,000
If I get stuck anywhere.

1222
01:26:13,000 --> 01:26:15,000
This is such a leap of faith.

1223
01:26:15,000 --> 01:26:16,000
It's terrible.

1224
01:26:16,000 --> 01:26:18,000
There's no reason for me to do this.

1225
01:26:18,000 --> 01:26:20,000
No reason.

1226
01:26:20,000 --> 01:26:23,000
It's safe.

1227
01:26:24,000 --> 01:26:27,000
I don't know.

1228
01:26:27,000 --> 01:26:29,000
I don't know how much I was alone.

1229
01:26:29,000 --> 01:26:37,000
Okay, I can see.

1230
01:26:37,000 --> 01:26:41,000
How do you make that jump?

1231
01:26:41,000 --> 01:26:44,000
How do you make that jump?

1232
01:26:44,000 --> 01:26:48,000
Are you even supposed to?

1233
01:26:48,000 --> 01:26:52,000
I feel like you're probably not even supposed to.

1234
01:26:53,000 --> 01:26:56,000
Now that way is just total death.

1235
01:26:56,000 --> 01:26:58,000
I'm not going down.

1236
01:26:58,000 --> 01:27:04,000
I'm gonna stake that would be.

1237
01:27:04,000 --> 01:27:06,000
Spin dodge, probably.

1238
01:27:06,000 --> 01:27:08,000
I have people saying to the Spin dodge thing.

1239
01:27:08,000 --> 01:27:15,000
Yeah, that's definitely it.

1240
01:27:15,000 --> 01:27:17,000
I can just go for up here, can I?

1241
01:27:17,000 --> 01:27:19,000
Look at that jump up here.

1242
01:27:19,000 --> 01:27:21,000
I might just overshoot it.

1243
01:27:21,000 --> 01:27:26,000
I don't know.

1244
01:27:26,000 --> 01:27:28,000
We're okay.

1245
01:27:28,000 --> 01:27:29,000
We're fine.

1246
01:27:29,000 --> 01:27:38,000
That was a huge overshoot, but I'm all right.

1247
01:27:38,000 --> 01:27:40,000
No, you have to go around.

1248
01:27:40,000 --> 01:27:46,000
He did the thing that I did in my terrible shitty level.

1249
01:27:46,000 --> 01:27:48,000
I need to see what's down here.

1250
01:27:48,000 --> 01:27:57,000
I can stand on that, but no more, no further to the left.

1251
01:27:57,000 --> 01:27:58,000
I'm gonna get his touch the plant.

1252
01:27:58,000 --> 01:28:04,000
Touch the plant pot, I don't care.

1253
01:28:04,000 --> 01:28:06,000
I do have another screen to see comments.

1254
01:28:06,000 --> 01:28:13,000
Unfortunately, it's hard to see it because I have to look down on my iPad, because I don't have

1255
01:28:13,000 --> 01:28:16,000
to really set up that well.

1256
01:28:16,000 --> 01:28:19,000
Unfortunately.

1257
01:28:19,000 --> 01:28:26,000
But I can't, yes, every so often I am looking down and seeing.

1258
01:28:26,000 --> 01:28:32,000
Almost halfway there.

1259
01:28:32,000 --> 01:28:36,000
I want to do something cool for Mario Maker actual level.

1260
01:28:36,000 --> 01:28:37,000
That could be fun.

1261
01:28:37,000 --> 01:28:38,000
Oh shit, I lost you.

1262
01:28:38,000 --> 01:28:39,000
What the fuck happened to me?

1263
01:28:39,000 --> 01:28:42,000
I'm literally reading chat.

1264
01:28:42,000 --> 01:28:45,000
I just got high man made this.

1265
01:28:45,000 --> 01:28:47,000
Oh, that's what it killed me.

1266
01:28:47,000 --> 01:28:53,000
I lost the chat, hold on, I got a reloaded chat.

1267
01:28:53,000 --> 01:28:55,000
There it is.

1268
01:28:55,000 --> 01:29:00,000
There's the chat.

1269
01:29:00,000 --> 01:29:02,000
All right.

1270
01:29:02,000 --> 01:29:07,000
Let's sit here and contemplate what's going on here.

1271
01:29:08,000 --> 01:29:10,000
Okay.

1272
01:29:10,000 --> 01:29:14,000
I understand.

1273
01:29:14,000 --> 01:29:16,000
Coolest one so far.

1274
01:29:16,000 --> 01:29:18,000
That was the coolest one so far.

1275
01:29:18,000 --> 01:29:19,000
I don't care how short it was.

1276
01:29:19,000 --> 01:29:26,000
That was really, really cool.

1277
01:29:26,000 --> 01:29:29,000
I think that was, that was, that was pretty sweet.

1278
01:29:29,000 --> 01:29:31,000
Too hard to.

1279
01:29:31,000 --> 01:29:32,000
Is this one?

1280
01:29:32,000 --> 01:29:33,000
Too hard to.

1281
01:29:33,000 --> 01:29:36,000
So this is too hard one.

1282
01:29:36,000 --> 01:29:45,000
Apparently it's too hard.

1283
01:29:45,000 --> 01:29:48,000
This one is just called level one.

1284
01:29:48,000 --> 01:29:53,000
So remake of the old classic classic level one.

1285
01:29:53,000 --> 01:29:55,000
That's something hidden in these.

1286
01:29:55,000 --> 01:29:57,000
That's something like hidden shit in here.

1287
01:29:57,000 --> 01:29:59,000
No.

1288
01:29:59,000 --> 01:30:02,000
All right.

1289
01:30:02,000 --> 01:30:04,000
That doesn't work.

1290
01:30:04,000 --> 01:30:11,000
You plumbing is all screwed up.

1291
01:30:11,000 --> 01:30:13,000
We're still on normal, right?

1292
01:30:13,000 --> 01:30:21,000
We didn't just trek back to easy for some reason.

1293
01:30:21,000 --> 01:30:24,000
Oh, nice peek so soon.

1294
01:30:24,000 --> 01:30:25,000
Forget it.

1295
01:30:25,000 --> 01:30:31,000
We're just moving in the jump.

1296
01:30:31,000 --> 01:30:33,000
Got these flying things.

1297
01:30:33,000 --> 01:30:40,000
Actually, no, no, no, it just got really, really annoying.

1298
01:30:40,000 --> 01:30:45,000
Oh.

1299
01:30:45,000 --> 01:30:47,000
That one, that one, this one's not even hard.

1300
01:30:47,000 --> 01:30:55,000
I just, I missed represented where I was going to be falling there.

1301
01:30:55,000 --> 01:30:58,000
It shouldn't have happened.

1302
01:30:58,000 --> 01:31:01,000
Again, we're just going to go with the jump.

1303
01:31:01,000 --> 01:31:08,000
Forget about anything else.

1304
01:31:08,000 --> 01:31:09,000
I didn't want that.

1305
01:31:09,000 --> 01:31:10,000
I didn't want that.

1306
01:31:10,000 --> 01:31:11,000
I didn't want to pick that up.

1307
01:31:11,000 --> 01:31:14,000
I didn't want that.

1308
01:31:14,000 --> 01:31:23,000
I didn't want it.

1309
01:31:23,000 --> 01:31:25,000
I picked it up anyways though.

1310
01:31:25,000 --> 01:31:31,000
The easier level now, this one's giving me the trouble for some reason.

1311
01:31:31,000 --> 01:31:32,000
Just do the jump.

1312
01:31:32,000 --> 01:31:38,000
Don't pick up the thing.

1313
01:31:38,000 --> 01:31:40,000
Wait, be patient.

1314
01:31:40,000 --> 01:31:44,000
Wait.

1315
01:31:44,000 --> 01:31:46,000
Actually, didn't even see him go up.

1316
01:31:46,000 --> 01:31:50,000
That was dumb.

1317
01:31:50,000 --> 01:31:52,000
That was dumb.

1318
01:31:52,000 --> 01:31:56,000
That was real fucking dumb.

1319
01:31:56,000 --> 01:31:58,000
What's the name of this level again?

1320
01:31:58,000 --> 01:32:01,000
Like, hi.

1321
01:32:01,000 --> 01:32:06,000
When you name your level, hi, it means that you just made the level in 10 seconds and you're just testing it.

1322
01:32:06,000 --> 01:32:09,000
I'm having trouble with the fucking test level.

1323
01:32:09,000 --> 01:32:11,000
Can I kill that with this?

1324
01:32:11,000 --> 01:32:16,000
I'm not even going to try because I don't know.

1325
01:32:16,000 --> 01:32:20,000
I'm just fucking jumping over the whole damn thing.

1326
01:32:20,000 --> 01:32:24,000
I'm jumping over the entire thing.

1327
01:32:24,000 --> 01:32:25,000
No balls, shit.

1328
01:32:25,000 --> 01:32:31,000
I'm just going to go over the whole thing.

1329
01:32:31,000 --> 01:32:38,000
Nothing in those.

1330
01:32:38,000 --> 01:32:49,000
Get that out of the way.

1331
01:32:49,000 --> 01:32:50,000
Okay.

1332
01:32:50,000 --> 01:32:55,000
I said I was going to do that, but I lied.

1333
01:32:55,000 --> 01:32:57,000
Like, god.

1334
01:32:57,000 --> 01:33:05,000
Oh, fuck.

1335
01:33:05,000 --> 01:33:08,000
My whole body hurts from that.

1336
01:33:08,000 --> 01:33:13,000
My whole body hurts.

1337
01:33:13,000 --> 01:33:24,000
Like, any more of that, of that, like, kind of straight and I would have thrown up.

1338
01:33:24,000 --> 01:33:26,000
Do you see how he's spacing these?

1339
01:33:26,000 --> 01:33:31,000
He's spacing them ever so slightly different.

1340
01:33:31,000 --> 01:33:44,000
That was a nice one.

1341
01:33:44,000 --> 01:33:54,000
You almost got beat the end there.

1342
01:33:54,000 --> 01:33:57,000
Is this the go-into-I-throw-up stream you mentioned before?

1343
01:33:57,000 --> 01:33:59,000
Could be.

1344
01:33:59,000 --> 01:34:04,000
Which I got these fucking ground-bounders.

1345
01:34:04,000 --> 01:34:06,000
You're going to put enemies in my way.

1346
01:34:06,000 --> 01:34:09,000
You're going to fool me with that?

1347
01:34:09,000 --> 01:34:12,000
Not easily fooled.

1348
01:34:12,000 --> 01:34:13,000
Okay.

1349
01:34:13,000 --> 01:34:17,000
Thought that was going to hit me.

1350
01:34:17,000 --> 01:34:26,000
Well, that was another one of those levels where you just kind of run forward.

1351
01:34:26,000 --> 01:34:29,000
Run for your life castle.

1352
01:34:29,000 --> 01:34:32,000
What was that picture of that face?

1353
01:34:32,000 --> 01:34:35,000
What was that big like face?

1354
01:34:35,000 --> 01:34:38,000
I want to draw a picture like that.

1355
01:34:38,000 --> 01:34:46,000
Don't move.

1356
01:34:46,000 --> 01:34:49,000
You got to be kidding me.

1357
01:34:49,000 --> 01:34:51,000
Are you kidding me?

1358
01:34:51,000 --> 01:34:53,000
I'm not moving.

1359
01:34:53,000 --> 01:34:57,000
I'm not moving anything.

1360
01:34:57,000 --> 01:35:04,000
Oh my god, that was fucking awesome.

1361
01:35:04,000 --> 01:35:06,000
Now that's the type of stuff I like to see.

1362
01:35:06,000 --> 01:35:12,000
That was really cool.

1363
01:35:12,000 --> 01:35:16,000
That was awesome.

1364
01:35:16,000 --> 01:35:30,000
Alright, was this like a swear word?

1365
01:35:30,000 --> 01:35:38,000
Can you get a hundred?

1366
01:35:38,000 --> 01:35:41,000
I just did.

1367
01:35:41,000 --> 01:35:44,000
Right?

1368
01:35:44,000 --> 01:35:47,000
I don't know what he's asking me.

1369
01:35:47,000 --> 01:35:50,000
I'm not on what he's asking me to do.

1370
01:35:50,000 --> 01:35:53,000
Going up.

1371
01:35:53,000 --> 01:35:56,000
Can I get a hundred?

1372
01:35:56,000 --> 01:35:59,000
What coins?

1373
01:35:59,000 --> 01:36:06,000
What kind of one-up mushroom was that?

1374
01:36:06,000 --> 01:36:09,000
He's got something over here.

1375
01:36:09,000 --> 01:36:11,000
Yeah, there is something over here.

1376
01:36:11,000 --> 01:36:14,000
I don't speak that language.

1377
01:36:14,000 --> 01:36:17,000
I don't know what that says.

1378
01:36:17,000 --> 01:36:20,000
It's the secret door over there.

1379
01:36:20,000 --> 01:36:21,000
Hold on.

1380
01:36:21,000 --> 01:36:24,000
There might be more things.

1381
01:36:24,000 --> 01:36:25,000
Odd level.

1382
01:36:25,000 --> 01:36:29,000
Doesn't even shoot bullets.

1383
01:36:29,000 --> 01:36:38,000
Alright, we got a shoe.

1384
01:36:38,000 --> 01:36:40,000
I think I screwed it up.

1385
01:36:40,000 --> 01:36:42,000
I'm pretty sure I had to hit that.

1386
01:36:42,000 --> 01:36:47,000
But whatever I got the shoe.

1387
01:36:47,000 --> 01:36:53,000
Well, we'll move over here.

1388
01:36:53,000 --> 01:36:55,000
Ooh.

1389
01:36:55,000 --> 01:36:56,000
Okay.

1390
01:36:56,000 --> 01:36:59,000
What's the point of that?

1391
01:36:59,000 --> 01:37:01,000
It's just, it's gonna be a coin.

1392
01:37:01,000 --> 01:37:07,000
Whatever, let's just go.

1393
01:37:07,000 --> 01:37:08,000
What?

1394
01:37:08,000 --> 01:37:10,000
Why the item?

1395
01:37:10,000 --> 01:37:14,000
He just put random things in boxes.

1396
01:37:14,000 --> 01:37:17,000
Alright.

1397
01:37:17,000 --> 01:37:21,000
Let's hop, skip and jump out of here.

1398
01:37:21,000 --> 01:37:27,000
Fall down this hole.

1399
01:37:27,000 --> 01:37:28,000
Let me guess.

1400
01:37:28,000 --> 01:37:30,000
There's gonna be an enemy in here.

1401
01:37:30,000 --> 01:37:31,000
Nope.

1402
01:37:31,000 --> 01:37:32,000
Oh, that was the...

1403
01:37:32,000 --> 01:37:33,000
Oh, yeah.

1404
01:37:33,000 --> 01:37:36,000
I did that, whatever.

1405
01:37:37,000 --> 01:37:39,000
Yeah, that was a...

1406
01:37:39,000 --> 01:37:41,000
I actually kind of liked that level.

1407
01:37:41,000 --> 01:37:43,000
It was really, really odd.

1408
01:37:43,000 --> 01:37:46,000
It was just odd.

1409
01:37:46,000 --> 01:37:48,000
Get them on 100 coins.

1410
01:37:48,000 --> 01:37:51,000
Easy.

1411
01:37:51,000 --> 01:37:56,000
It was pretty easy.

1412
01:37:56,000 --> 01:37:57,000
I don't know.

1413
01:37:57,000 --> 01:37:59,000
That could be some type of warning.

1414
01:37:59,000 --> 01:38:03,000
I don't know what it says.

1415
01:38:03,000 --> 01:38:09,000
I'm gonna assume I had to just do that.

1416
01:38:09,000 --> 01:38:12,000
Whoa.

1417
01:38:12,000 --> 01:38:17,000
It's just launching around hitting everything.

1418
01:38:17,000 --> 01:38:19,000
I should have went with it.

1419
01:38:19,000 --> 01:38:22,000
See, I didn't go fast enough.

1420
01:38:22,000 --> 01:38:26,000
It's an arm at the mercy of walking very slow.

1421
01:38:26,000 --> 01:38:29,000
Slowly.

1422
01:38:33,000 --> 01:38:40,000
Oh, no, no, no, no, no.

1423
01:38:40,000 --> 01:38:43,000
Oh, this is right in my fucking way.

1424
01:38:43,000 --> 01:38:46,000
You have to follow it.

1425
01:38:46,000 --> 01:38:48,000
I didn't know that was gonna be right the way.

1426
01:38:48,000 --> 01:38:49,000
I'm actually still going.

1427
01:38:49,000 --> 01:38:53,000
I can still see it.

1428
01:38:53,000 --> 01:38:54,000
No, no.

1429
01:38:54,000 --> 01:38:56,000
Stop hanging onto the wall.

1430
01:38:56,000 --> 01:39:02,000
You glued to the wall.

1431
01:39:02,000 --> 01:39:09,000
It's just going all over the place.

1432
01:39:09,000 --> 01:39:10,000
Thought it was end up at the end.

1433
01:39:10,000 --> 01:39:15,000
I do.

1434
01:39:15,000 --> 01:39:17,000
Okay, what happened here?

1435
01:39:17,000 --> 01:39:20,000
These levels were difficult, kind of, moderately hard.

1436
01:39:20,000 --> 01:39:22,000
The first like four.

1437
01:39:22,000 --> 01:39:28,000
And now we're getting, hey, watch a bunch of turtles get hit by a shell.

1438
01:39:28,000 --> 01:39:35,000
Where is this level 12?

1439
01:39:35,000 --> 01:39:44,000
This looks like it's a level.

1440
01:39:44,000 --> 01:39:46,000
Who needs it?

1441
01:39:46,000 --> 01:39:51,000
Skip the whole thing.

1442
01:39:51,000 --> 01:39:52,000
Three one-ups.

1443
01:39:52,000 --> 01:39:53,000
Does that mean no?

1444
01:39:53,000 --> 01:39:54,000
Boy.

1445
01:39:54,000 --> 01:39:56,000
No, it's all right.

1446
01:39:56,000 --> 01:39:57,000
System.

1447
01:39:57,000 --> 01:40:02,000
I beat it.

1448
01:40:02,000 --> 01:40:04,000
You wearing your glue man shirt?

1449
01:40:04,000 --> 01:40:07,000
Nice.

1450
01:40:07,000 --> 01:40:14,000
Good old glue man.

1451
01:40:14,000 --> 01:40:15,000
Yeah, what happened?

1452
01:40:15,000 --> 01:40:22,000
These were parkour.

1453
01:40:22,000 --> 01:40:26,000
Am I chic right now?

1454
01:40:26,000 --> 01:40:27,000
Wow.

1455
01:40:27,000 --> 01:40:31,000
I move fast.

1456
01:40:31,000 --> 01:40:33,000
Is that going to kill me?

1457
01:40:33,000 --> 01:40:34,000
Is that going to kill me?

1458
01:40:34,000 --> 01:40:35,000
Probably.

1459
01:40:35,000 --> 01:40:37,000
Oh, dear goodness.

1460
01:40:37,000 --> 01:40:39,000
I feel like I can just make it.

1461
01:40:39,000 --> 01:40:40,000
I think I can just make it.

1462
01:40:40,000 --> 01:40:41,000
I can make it.

1463
01:40:41,000 --> 01:40:44,000
I can just make it.

1464
01:40:44,000 --> 01:40:48,000
I can.

1465
01:40:48,000 --> 01:40:49,000
How do you unlock shit like that?

1466
01:40:49,000 --> 01:40:50,000
See, that's what good cool.

1467
01:40:50,000 --> 01:40:57,000
I want to like put a sheet in my level.

1468
01:40:57,000 --> 01:41:05,000
Getting close.

1469
01:41:05,000 --> 01:41:08,000
And then I'm going to try to make a level for real.

1470
01:41:08,000 --> 01:41:09,000
A real.

1471
01:41:09,000 --> 01:41:10,000
This is just keep running.

1472
01:41:10,000 --> 01:41:11,000
The other one told me not to move.

1473
01:41:11,000 --> 01:41:12,000
This one's telling me to move.

1474
01:41:12,000 --> 01:41:19,000
So I'm just going to move.

1475
01:41:19,000 --> 01:41:26,000
I'm just going to move.

1476
01:41:26,000 --> 01:41:31,000
I just...

1477
01:41:31,000 --> 01:41:33,000
That was so many stars.

1478
01:41:33,000 --> 01:41:38,000
That was too many stars.

1479
01:41:38,000 --> 01:41:45,000
I'm just going to move.

1480
01:41:45,000 --> 01:41:46,000
Damn it.

1481
01:41:46,000 --> 01:41:52,000
I didn't run fast enough.

1482
01:41:52,000 --> 01:41:54,000
Run.

1483
01:41:54,000 --> 01:41:56,000
This time don't overshoot it.

1484
01:41:56,000 --> 01:42:00,000
Just wait for the cloud.

1485
01:42:00,000 --> 01:42:02,000
I thought I missed it.

1486
01:42:02,000 --> 01:42:07,000
In fact, I probably did.

1487
01:42:07,000 --> 01:42:09,000
You get a transfer.

1488
01:42:09,000 --> 01:42:14,000
So it's like a relay race.

1489
01:42:14,000 --> 01:42:21,000
What is this here for?

1490
01:42:21,000 --> 01:42:33,000
It's like watching my mom play Mario.

1491
01:42:33,000 --> 01:42:35,000
Getting closer to the last one.

1492
01:42:35,000 --> 01:42:42,000
Second and last level.

1493
01:42:42,000 --> 01:42:45,000
What was this one called?

1494
01:42:45,000 --> 01:42:47,000
I was looking down a chat.

1495
01:42:47,000 --> 01:42:51,000
Who knows?

1496
01:42:51,000 --> 01:42:58,000
Let's go.

1497
01:42:58,000 --> 01:43:00,000
That doesn't hit him.

1498
01:43:00,000 --> 01:43:15,000
Shoot.

1499
01:43:15,000 --> 01:43:23,000
Okay.

1500
01:43:23,000 --> 01:43:29,000
Interesting.

1501
01:43:29,000 --> 01:43:34,000
Can I not do that?

1502
01:43:34,000 --> 01:43:37,000
Maybe I can be going here?

1503
01:43:37,000 --> 01:43:39,000
I guess not.

1504
01:43:39,000 --> 01:43:43,000
How do I get up there?

1505
01:43:43,000 --> 01:43:50,000
Is it supposed to take that shell or something or jump on top of it?

1506
01:43:50,000 --> 01:43:52,000
I guess I have to take damage.

1507
01:43:52,000 --> 01:43:54,000
I guess.

1508
01:43:54,000 --> 01:43:59,000
I don't think this is possible for me to go in here anymore.

1509
01:43:59,000 --> 01:44:01,000
No, I can't go in here anymore.

1510
01:44:01,000 --> 01:44:06,000
I walked myself out of here.

1511
01:44:06,000 --> 01:44:10,000
It's time to do it.

1512
01:44:10,000 --> 01:44:13,000
Yeah, goofed it up.

1513
01:44:13,000 --> 01:44:14,000
I goofed it up.

1514
01:44:14,000 --> 01:44:15,000
First try.

1515
01:44:15,000 --> 01:44:16,000
Is the name of this one?

1516
01:44:16,000 --> 01:44:18,000
Maybe I would have had that first try.

1517
01:44:18,000 --> 01:44:19,000
I didn't...

1518
01:44:19,000 --> 01:44:22,000
I can muck that all up.

1519
01:44:22,000 --> 01:44:29,000
I didn't even goop that all up.

1520
01:44:29,000 --> 01:44:30,000
Get out of here.

1521
01:44:30,000 --> 01:44:34,000
Oh shit.

1522
01:44:34,000 --> 01:44:35,000
Come on.

1523
01:44:35,000 --> 01:44:39,000
I don't have time for this.

1524
01:44:39,000 --> 01:44:40,000
I don't have time for this.

1525
01:44:40,000 --> 01:44:43,000
I don't have time for this.

1526
01:44:43,000 --> 01:44:45,000
I can run past that.

1527
01:44:45,000 --> 01:44:46,000
Why did I freak out?

1528
01:44:46,000 --> 01:44:47,000
Why did I just freak out?

1529
01:44:47,000 --> 01:44:49,000
What the fuck out right there?

1530
01:44:49,000 --> 01:44:51,000
I didn't think I was going to make it.

1531
01:44:51,000 --> 01:44:58,000
For some strange reason.

1532
01:44:58,000 --> 01:45:05,000
It's the last level.

1533
01:45:05,000 --> 01:45:12,000
And hopefully I can unlock some more stuff.

1534
01:45:12,000 --> 01:45:14,000
The final level.

1535
01:45:14,000 --> 01:45:20,000
Very cool.

1536
01:45:21,000 --> 01:45:27,000
What the hell is this mess of a level?

1537
01:45:27,000 --> 01:45:30,000
I was just taking that all in.

1538
01:45:30,000 --> 01:45:38,000
What's taking that in?

1539
01:45:38,000 --> 01:45:39,000
What's one of these?

1540
01:45:39,000 --> 01:45:42,000
The platform moves.

1541
01:45:42,000 --> 01:45:43,000
What a mess.

1542
01:45:43,000 --> 01:45:47,000
What a mess.

1543
01:45:47,000 --> 01:45:48,000
Whoa.

1544
01:45:48,000 --> 01:45:50,000
Okay, you're safe as long as you don't do that.

1545
01:45:50,000 --> 01:45:54,000
And here comes Bowser.

1546
01:45:54,000 --> 01:45:58,000
They're all locked up there.

1547
01:45:58,000 --> 01:46:07,000
100 man Mario Challenge, or normal, has been completed.

1548
01:46:07,000 --> 01:46:13,000
Alright, it's time to make one.

1549
01:46:13,000 --> 01:46:16,000
I finished it.

1550
01:46:16,000 --> 01:46:19,000
I have 94 more tries to beat that.

1551
01:46:19,000 --> 01:46:28,000
Yeah, I know.

1552
01:46:28,000 --> 01:46:31,000
Okay, let me see the credits.

1553
01:46:31,000 --> 01:46:32,000
Remember that one.

1554
01:46:32,000 --> 01:46:33,000
Hey, do you guys remember that one?

1555
01:46:33,000 --> 01:46:34,000
That one was cool.

1556
01:46:34,000 --> 01:46:35,000
Remember that one.

1557
01:46:35,000 --> 01:46:37,000
Hey, do you guys remember that one?

1558
01:46:37,000 --> 01:46:38,000
I'm number level one.

1559
01:46:38,000 --> 01:46:40,000
Hey, remember run for your life castle?

1560
01:46:40,000 --> 01:46:41,000
Where you had to run real fast?

1561
01:46:41,000 --> 01:46:44,000
Oh my god, I remember that one.

1562
01:46:44,000 --> 01:46:45,000
I remember parkour.

1563
01:46:45,000 --> 01:46:46,000
Sheeek.

1564
01:46:46,000 --> 01:46:55,000
Oh, that was so cool.

1565
01:46:55,000 --> 01:47:04,000
Mystery mushroom.

1566
01:47:04,000 --> 01:47:06,000
Know what does that mean?

1567
01:47:06,000 --> 01:47:08,000
Do I get some new stuff?

1568
01:47:08,000 --> 01:47:12,000
You've unlocked expert mode.

1569
01:47:12,000 --> 01:47:19,000
Okay, so I guess I'll just hold on.

1570
01:47:19,000 --> 01:47:22,000
I'll do this.

1571
01:47:22,000 --> 01:47:24,000
I'll do this.

1572
01:47:24,000 --> 01:47:26,000
Let me say.

1573
01:47:26,000 --> 01:47:27,000
Let me say.

1574
01:47:27,000 --> 01:47:39,000
Do you want me to do expert mode and lose and be sad?

1575
01:47:39,000 --> 01:47:45,000
Or should I try and actually really make a level?

1576
01:47:45,000 --> 01:47:50,000
I'm going to do a little straw polly.

1577
01:47:50,000 --> 01:47:55,000
I know what you guys are going to pick.

1578
01:47:55,000 --> 01:48:00,000
I know it's, I already know it.

1579
01:48:00,000 --> 01:48:20,000
But just for the sake of it doing it.

1580
01:48:20,000 --> 01:48:26,000
Let's see what happens.

1581
01:48:26,000 --> 01:48:28,000
Okay, guys.

1582
01:48:28,000 --> 01:48:31,000
Go ahead and vote.

1583
01:48:31,000 --> 01:48:42,000
Vote now.

1584
01:48:42,000 --> 01:48:47,000
Actually, that's 50-50.

1585
01:48:47,000 --> 01:48:55,000
I'm very surprised.

1586
01:48:55,000 --> 01:49:07,000
This is as neck and neck as I've ever seen something like this.

1587
01:49:07,000 --> 01:49:12,000
Should I hate myself and play expert and not do it and not win?

1588
01:49:12,000 --> 01:49:27,000
Or should make a fun level please pick me?

1589
01:49:27,000 --> 01:49:39,000
Let me have some fun.

1590
01:49:39,000 --> 01:49:42,000
The expert is winning.

1591
01:49:42,000 --> 01:49:49,000
It's very, very close.

1592
01:49:49,000 --> 01:50:01,000
Expert is so lame.

1593
01:50:01,000 --> 01:50:07,000
Well, the votes are in.

1594
01:50:07,000 --> 01:50:14,000
I'll do expert until I get down to like 60 lives.

1595
01:50:14,000 --> 01:50:22,000
If I get down to 70 lives in the first two levels, I'm just going to make a level.

1596
01:50:22,000 --> 01:50:30,000
I'm not going to lose my mind tonight.

1597
01:50:30,000 --> 01:50:36,000
Is just going to make levels that make themselves feel good.

1598
01:50:36,000 --> 01:50:39,000
Okay, well, that's a 52-48.

1599
01:50:39,000 --> 01:50:43,000
That was very close though.

1600
01:50:43,000 --> 01:50:45,000
Okay, new game.

1601
01:50:45,000 --> 01:50:48,000
Make sure expert is picked.

1602
01:50:48,000 --> 01:50:53,000
Let's go.

1603
01:50:53,000 --> 01:50:55,000
This is going to suck.

1604
01:50:55,000 --> 01:51:02,000
I was getting like mad in the beginning because, like in the first, like 15 minutes of the stream.

1605
01:51:02,000 --> 01:51:07,000
I was playing very difficult levels, at least in my opinion.

1606
01:51:07,000 --> 01:51:12,000
I was getting not happy at all.

1607
01:51:12,000 --> 01:51:16,000
Now I'm going to do that again.

1608
01:51:16,000 --> 01:51:22,000
Sure.

1609
01:51:22,000 --> 01:51:25,000
I was told to run.

1610
01:51:25,000 --> 01:51:31,000
So I believe that

1611
01:51:31,000 --> 01:51:34,000
I'm not sure what's going to happen here, but maybe I should just follow it.

1612
01:51:34,000 --> 01:51:37,000
Just run.

1613
01:51:37,000 --> 01:51:41,000
I didn't just run.

1614
01:51:41,000 --> 01:51:47,000
I held up.

1615
01:51:47,000 --> 01:51:51,000
I didn't just run.

1616
01:51:51,000 --> 01:52:00,000
I could have jumped over that possibly too.

1617
01:52:00,000 --> 01:52:03,000
Holy shit.

1618
01:52:03,000 --> 01:52:06,000
What?

1619
01:52:06,000 --> 01:52:09,000
What?

1620
01:52:09,000 --> 01:52:13,000
That was a wall of Bowser's.

1621
01:52:13,000 --> 01:52:19,000
Oh, just kill me now.

1622
01:52:19,000 --> 01:52:24,000
I might get there again, but I've only died like three.

1623
01:52:24,000 --> 01:52:26,000
Okay, that just screwed me.

1624
01:52:26,000 --> 01:52:29,000
What the fuck?

1625
01:52:29,000 --> 01:52:35,000
I'm just down like a drop down army when I'm trying to run through with a run to just run level.

1626
01:52:35,000 --> 01:52:38,000
That held me up for a quarter of a second.

1627
01:52:38,000 --> 01:52:42,000
That wouldn't have happened.

1628
01:52:42,000 --> 01:52:43,000
Whatever.

1629
01:52:43,000 --> 01:52:46,000
Just run.

1630
01:52:46,000 --> 01:52:50,000
But if you just run, I think I actually do have to make this thing.

1631
01:52:50,000 --> 01:52:52,000
No, I fucked it up.

1632
01:52:52,000 --> 01:52:54,000
We're not just running.

1633
01:52:54,000 --> 01:52:56,000
We are not just running.

1634
01:52:56,000 --> 01:52:57,000
Just run, huh?

1635
01:52:57,000 --> 01:52:59,000
What do you got a skeleton for?

1636
01:52:59,000 --> 01:53:02,000
You want me just to run?

1637
01:53:02,000 --> 01:53:08,000
Wait until these things are all dead, and I'm just going to go down here and just start.

1638
01:53:08,000 --> 01:53:10,000
Just start right there.

1639
01:53:10,000 --> 01:53:11,000
Just start.

1640
01:53:11,000 --> 01:53:13,000
Give me the start.

1641
01:53:13,000 --> 01:53:14,000
Fuck.

1642
01:53:14,000 --> 01:53:15,000
No.

1643
01:53:15,000 --> 01:53:18,000
Okay, I'm going to do that same strategy.

1644
01:53:18,000 --> 01:53:19,000
Same strategy.

1645
01:53:19,000 --> 01:53:21,000
I already screwed it all up.

1646
01:53:21,000 --> 01:53:22,000
That's over already.

1647
01:53:22,000 --> 01:53:23,000
I'm going to be not.

1648
01:53:23,000 --> 01:53:24,000
Yeah.

1649
01:53:24,000 --> 01:53:29,000
I'm not.

1650
01:53:29,000 --> 01:53:31,000
Did that start down there?

1651
01:53:31,000 --> 01:53:39,000
I have to get that.

1652
01:53:39,000 --> 01:53:40,000
Yeah.

1653
01:53:40,000 --> 01:53:41,000
That is the strategy.

1654
01:53:41,000 --> 01:53:43,000
That's the strategy I'm going with.

1655
01:53:43,000 --> 01:53:45,000
I'm going to stick to it.

1656
01:53:45,000 --> 01:53:46,000
Wait for all these idiots to go.

1657
01:53:46,000 --> 01:53:48,000
I forget which one was it.

1658
01:53:48,000 --> 01:53:50,000
To not have a bunch of unnecessary enemies.

1659
01:53:50,000 --> 01:53:53,000
I believe it was this one.

1660
01:53:53,000 --> 01:53:58,000
So then after this, I can just run.

1661
01:53:58,000 --> 01:54:00,000
Okay, it's this one.

1662
01:54:00,000 --> 01:54:02,000
Nope, it's this one.

1663
01:54:02,000 --> 01:54:05,000
Yep.

1664
01:54:05,000 --> 01:54:09,000
There's a spring.

1665
01:54:09,000 --> 01:54:10,000
There's a spring.

1666
01:54:10,000 --> 01:54:11,000
Chill out.

1667
01:54:11,000 --> 01:54:18,000
Okay, I'm good.

1668
01:54:18,000 --> 01:54:21,000
Is that...

1669
01:54:22,000 --> 01:54:24,000
Okay, good.

1670
01:54:24,000 --> 01:54:26,000
I thought that just...

1671
01:54:26,000 --> 01:54:33,000
I thought that just killed me at the end.

1672
01:54:33,000 --> 01:54:34,000
That was good.

1673
01:54:34,000 --> 01:54:41,000
That was a good one.

1674
01:54:41,000 --> 01:54:44,000
Blade jumper.

1675
01:54:44,000 --> 01:54:45,000
I love Mario 3.

1676
01:54:45,000 --> 01:54:46,000
Oh, Mario 3.

1677
01:54:46,000 --> 01:54:47,000
Cool.

1678
01:54:47,000 --> 01:54:48,000
Just run.

1679
01:54:52,000 --> 01:54:56,000
How do you even know that you can get that to happen?

1680
01:54:56,000 --> 01:54:57,000
Is my question.

1681
01:54:57,000 --> 01:55:03,000
That's crazy.

1682
01:55:03,000 --> 01:55:10,000
People are smart.

1683
01:55:10,000 --> 01:55:11,000
Okay, easy.

1684
01:55:11,000 --> 01:55:12,000
Easy.

1685
01:55:12,000 --> 01:55:13,000
I said easy.

1686
01:55:13,000 --> 01:55:14,000
I told you to be easy.

1687
01:55:14,000 --> 01:55:15,000
I told you to be easy.

1688
01:55:15,000 --> 01:55:16,000
And you freaked out.

1689
01:55:16,000 --> 01:55:18,000
That was so easy.

1690
01:55:18,000 --> 01:55:27,000
That was the easiest thing at that whole level.

1691
01:55:27,000 --> 01:55:30,000
Get out of here.

1692
01:55:30,000 --> 01:55:31,000
Yeah.

1693
01:55:31,000 --> 01:55:36,000
And your little dog too.

1694
01:55:36,000 --> 01:55:37,000
Fuck, just jump over it.

1695
01:55:37,000 --> 01:55:38,000
Fuck who cares?

1696
01:55:38,000 --> 01:55:42,000
Jump over the whole thing.

1697
01:55:42,000 --> 01:55:45,000
You're over-complicating things for yourself.

1698
01:55:45,000 --> 01:55:54,000
That's pretty usual.

1699
01:55:54,000 --> 01:55:55,000
T.

1700
01:55:55,000 --> 01:55:58,000
It was not a reason to do that.

1701
01:55:58,000 --> 01:55:59,000
I don't believe this.

1702
01:55:59,000 --> 01:56:00,000
I don't believe it.

1703
01:56:00,000 --> 01:56:01,000
I don't think this is real.

1704
01:56:01,000 --> 01:56:03,000
I think it's trying to screw with me.

1705
01:56:03,000 --> 01:56:10,000
Maybe not.

1706
01:56:10,000 --> 01:56:13,000
Too much thinking.

1707
01:56:14,000 --> 01:56:16,000
Then I go right through.

1708
01:56:16,000 --> 01:56:21,000
I have a lot of trouble with those because you can't keep moving.

1709
01:56:21,000 --> 01:56:24,000
You have to just go straight up.

1710
01:56:24,000 --> 01:56:31,000
I got it this time.

1711
01:56:31,000 --> 01:56:39,000
You can skip levels.

1712
01:56:39,000 --> 01:56:40,000
Nope.

1713
01:56:40,000 --> 01:56:42,000
We're not doing that.

1714
01:56:42,000 --> 01:56:47,000
I'm not skipping levels.

1715
01:56:47,000 --> 01:56:48,000
They don't drive angry.

1716
01:56:48,000 --> 01:56:50,000
Never drive angry.

1717
01:56:50,000 --> 01:56:51,000
And that's what I'm doing right now.

1718
01:56:51,000 --> 01:56:52,000
I'm trying behind the...

1719
01:56:52,000 --> 01:56:54,000
I'm driving angry.

1720
01:56:54,000 --> 01:56:56,000
Just take a deep breath.

1721
01:56:56,000 --> 01:56:57,000
Okay.

1722
01:56:57,000 --> 01:56:58,000
We're good.

1723
01:56:58,000 --> 01:57:07,000
Move.

1724
01:57:07,000 --> 01:57:08,000
Fuckin' drive an angry.

1725
01:57:08,000 --> 01:57:09,000
Don't drive angry.

1726
01:57:09,000 --> 01:57:16,000
Not like it matters anyways.

1727
01:57:16,000 --> 01:57:20,000
This one just go.

1728
01:57:20,000 --> 01:57:21,000
Just do it.

1729
01:57:21,000 --> 01:57:23,000
You see what I'm talking about?

1730
01:57:23,000 --> 01:57:25,000
You see what I'm talking about?

1731
01:57:25,000 --> 01:57:26,000
You see what I'm talking about?

1732
01:57:26,000 --> 01:57:27,000
You just like...

1733
01:57:27,000 --> 01:57:28,000
When you land on it.

1734
01:57:28,000 --> 01:57:29,000
Instead of just...

1735
01:57:29,000 --> 01:57:33,000
I can feel...

1736
01:57:33,000 --> 01:57:36,000
I can feel...

1737
01:57:36,000 --> 01:57:39,000
I'm like my face is heating up.

1738
01:57:39,000 --> 01:57:45,000
You know when you feel your face just heating up and you just feel them.

1739
01:57:45,000 --> 01:57:50,000
Somebody needs to put like a fire extinguisher into my face.

1740
01:57:50,000 --> 01:57:53,000
Cause it's fuckin' flaming right now.

1741
01:57:53,000 --> 01:57:58,000
Get up.

1742
01:57:58,000 --> 01:58:02,000
Is something down there?

1743
01:58:02,000 --> 01:58:04,000
Listen, let me look down here.

1744
01:58:04,000 --> 01:58:06,000
No, it doesn't look like it.

1745
01:58:06,000 --> 01:58:08,000
Maybe there is.

1746
01:58:08,000 --> 01:58:09,000
I guess not.

1747
01:58:09,000 --> 01:58:17,000
Whatever.

1748
01:58:17,000 --> 01:58:19,000
That was a tried and true strategy.

1749
01:58:19,000 --> 01:58:21,000
No, no, no, no.

1750
01:58:21,000 --> 01:58:22,000
No more talking.

1751
01:58:22,000 --> 01:58:28,000
No more excuses.

1752
01:58:28,000 --> 01:58:30,000
No more excuses.

1753
01:58:30,000 --> 01:58:35,000
We just got so ridiculously incredibly lucky right there.

1754
01:58:35,000 --> 01:58:37,000
Yeah, words can't even describe.

1755
01:58:37,000 --> 01:58:42,000
So let's capitalize on it.

1756
01:58:42,000 --> 01:58:52,000
It's like, you know, sometimes, why does it not just not work sometimes?

1757
01:58:52,000 --> 01:58:55,000
Like that.

1758
01:58:55,000 --> 01:59:02,000
When we get inside this tube, it's really, really annoying.

1759
01:59:02,000 --> 01:59:13,000
Ah, I thought that was the end.

1760
01:59:13,000 --> 01:59:15,000
I thought that was the end.

1761
01:59:15,000 --> 01:59:20,000
I was desperately trying to find the end there.

1762
01:59:20,000 --> 01:59:23,000
You can't be serious.

1763
01:59:23,000 --> 01:59:24,000
Don't do that.

1764
01:59:24,000 --> 01:59:33,000
Write one under the end.

1765
01:59:33,000 --> 01:59:35,000
Whoa!

1766
01:59:35,000 --> 01:59:36,000
There's more.

1767
01:59:36,000 --> 01:59:40,000
There's even more to this fuckin' shit show.

1768
01:59:40,000 --> 01:59:47,000
Thank goodness.

1769
01:59:47,000 --> 01:59:50,000
There's always, they always try to screw you at the end.

1770
01:59:50,000 --> 01:59:51,000
I knew it.

1771
01:59:51,000 --> 01:59:57,000
See, there was a possibility that I was just gonna run straight over there.

1772
01:59:57,000 --> 02:00:03,000
There was an opportunity for me just to walk right off.

1773
02:00:03,000 --> 02:00:07,000
That was a good level.

1774
02:00:07,000 --> 02:00:08,000
Okay.

1775
02:00:08,000 --> 02:00:09,000
What did I say?

1776
02:00:09,000 --> 02:00:13,000
Like, 60 or like 70 lives?

1777
02:00:13,000 --> 02:00:18,000
Spin jump.

1778
02:00:18,000 --> 02:00:19,000
Okay.

1779
02:00:19,000 --> 02:00:24,000
Spin jump.

1780
02:00:24,000 --> 02:00:30,000
I'm assuming I gotta spin jump the whole way.

1781
02:00:30,000 --> 02:00:35,000
You see how he perfectly lined that up to get hit right there?

1782
02:00:35,000 --> 02:00:38,000
Don't ask me how he survived that.

1783
02:00:38,000 --> 02:00:39,000
What?

1784
02:00:39,000 --> 02:00:40,000
What?

1785
02:00:40,000 --> 02:00:41,000
Oh my god, jump.

1786
02:00:41,000 --> 02:00:48,000
There's a paper airplane everywhere too.

1787
02:00:48,000 --> 02:00:52,000
I'll give you a spin jump.

1788
02:00:52,000 --> 02:00:57,000
I almost just didn't do it right there.

1789
02:00:57,000 --> 02:01:02,000
There we go.

1790
02:01:02,000 --> 02:01:06,000
I gotta beat these.

1791
02:01:06,000 --> 02:01:08,000
Can I jump on them?

1792
02:01:08,000 --> 02:01:14,000
Yes, you can.

1793
02:01:14,000 --> 02:01:18,000
Just wait for these.

1794
02:01:18,000 --> 02:01:21,000
Get the spin needed overhead.

1795
02:01:21,000 --> 02:01:28,000
And that's the end.

1796
02:01:28,000 --> 02:01:30,000
Yikes.

1797
02:01:30,000 --> 02:01:33,000
Yikes.

1798
02:01:33,000 --> 02:01:37,000
I think I'm gonna do it.

1799
02:01:37,000 --> 02:01:39,000
Look at this guy.

1800
02:01:39,000 --> 02:01:44,000
Don't like it.

1801
02:01:44,000 --> 02:01:45,000
All right, well.

1802
02:01:45,000 --> 02:01:52,000
His opinion was heard.

1803
02:01:52,000 --> 02:02:03,000
Hold on just a second.

1804
02:02:03,000 --> 02:02:10,000
I can probably just do this real quick.

1805
02:02:10,000 --> 02:02:21,000
I think I just killed it.

1806
02:02:21,000 --> 02:02:22,000
Did I?

1807
02:02:22,000 --> 02:02:25,000
Did I kill it?

1808
02:02:25,000 --> 02:02:29,000
No, I think we're still here, right?

1809
02:02:29,000 --> 02:02:32,000
Yeah, we're here.

1810
02:02:32,000 --> 02:02:37,000
Okay.

1811
02:02:37,000 --> 02:02:43,000
Wait, I don't want to comment.

1812
02:02:43,000 --> 02:02:45,000
Let's go.

1813
02:02:45,000 --> 02:02:47,000
What was the name of this one?

1814
02:02:47,000 --> 02:02:54,000
Epic Ghost House.

1815
02:02:54,000 --> 02:03:01,000
Let me get a feel for this one.

1816
02:03:01,000 --> 02:03:04,000
That's what's gonna happen.

1817
02:03:04,000 --> 02:03:06,000
There's another one.

1818
02:03:06,000 --> 02:03:14,000
How else would I be able to get up here?

1819
02:03:14,000 --> 02:03:21,000
Did I miss something when I was looking at stuff?

1820
02:03:21,000 --> 02:03:23,000
I feel like I missed something.

1821
02:03:23,000 --> 02:03:30,000
Maybe something flew by.

1822
02:03:30,000 --> 02:03:31,000
I know it.

1823
02:03:31,000 --> 02:03:33,000
I know it, of course.

1824
02:03:33,000 --> 02:03:38,000
Of course there's gonna be that.

1825
02:03:38,000 --> 02:03:40,000
That's as far as it goes.

1826
02:03:40,000 --> 02:03:42,000
What a dumb idea.

1827
02:03:42,000 --> 02:03:44,000
What a fucking idiot.

1828
02:03:44,000 --> 02:03:47,000
Like what a fucking dumb ass.

1829
02:03:47,000 --> 02:03:53,000
Why would I do something like that?

1830
02:03:53,000 --> 02:03:58,000
I just jumped off the edge in an unknown level.

1831
02:03:58,000 --> 02:04:05,000
What the fuck was that?

1832
02:04:05,000 --> 02:04:07,000
Epic Ghost House.

1833
02:04:07,000 --> 02:04:10,000
More like hidden blocks are going to kill you.

1834
02:04:10,000 --> 02:04:17,000
Oh my god.

1835
02:04:17,000 --> 02:04:20,000
Well, don't go there.

1836
02:04:20,000 --> 02:04:24,000
That's over here, right?

1837
02:04:24,000 --> 02:04:29,000
I'm gonna hit it again.

1838
02:04:29,000 --> 02:04:30,000
No.

1839
02:04:30,000 --> 02:04:32,000
Where is it?

1840
02:04:32,000 --> 02:04:34,000
Look at how?

1841
02:04:34,000 --> 02:04:37,000
Now I know.

1842
02:04:37,000 --> 02:04:40,000
Now I know what's going on.

1843
02:04:40,000 --> 02:04:47,000
I understand now.

1844
02:04:47,000 --> 02:04:48,000
Oh, I get it.

1845
02:04:48,000 --> 02:04:49,000
It's not that one.

1846
02:04:49,000 --> 02:04:52,000
It's right here.

1847
02:04:52,000 --> 02:04:55,000
I took me like 75 years to figure that out.

1848
02:04:55,000 --> 02:05:00,000
Now don't do that.

1849
02:05:00,000 --> 02:05:01,000
Okay.

1850
02:05:01,000 --> 02:05:07,000
I was certain that I was dead there.

1851
02:05:07,000 --> 02:05:10,000
Can I get out of here?

1852
02:05:10,000 --> 02:05:11,000
Shit.

1853
02:05:11,000 --> 02:05:16,000
This thing goes so fast.

1854
02:05:16,000 --> 02:05:17,000
I don't know.

1855
02:05:17,000 --> 02:05:18,000
I'm just gonna do this.

1856
02:05:18,000 --> 02:05:19,000
I'm scared.

1857
02:05:19,000 --> 02:05:22,000
I don't know what's going on, mom.

1858
02:05:22,000 --> 02:05:23,000
Oh, oh, shit.

1859
02:05:23,000 --> 02:05:24,000
I missed it.

1860
02:05:24,000 --> 02:05:25,000
I missed the bus.

1861
02:05:25,000 --> 02:05:31,000
I just missed the bus.

1862
02:05:31,000 --> 02:05:34,000
That is crazy.

1863
02:05:34,000 --> 02:05:35,000
That is crazy.

1864
02:05:35,000 --> 02:05:37,000
You just have to get lucky.

1865
02:05:37,000 --> 02:05:48,000
You just have to get lucky and hope to God that you can make it through that.

1866
02:05:48,000 --> 02:06:02,000
I hit it again.

1867
02:06:02,000 --> 02:06:03,000
I hit it again.

1868
02:06:03,000 --> 02:06:06,000
Now I'm just getting angry again.

1869
02:06:06,000 --> 02:06:15,000
I'm starting to get not happy again.

1870
02:06:15,000 --> 02:06:18,000
There's gotta be a rhyme to that.

1871
02:06:18,000 --> 02:06:27,000
I'm just now starting to figure out what's going on方ter.

1872
02:06:27,000 --> 02:06:29,000
Bound.

1873
02:06:29,000 --> 02:06:35,000
Bound.

1874
02:06:35,000 --> 02:06:37,000
Right there.

1875
02:06:37,000 --> 02:06:38,000
You know what?

1876
02:06:38,000 --> 02:06:42,000
I was gonna slowed down a little bit.

1877
02:06:42,000 --> 02:06:46,000
take that ride and hope you can jump over the stuff.

1878
02:06:46,000 --> 02:06:57,000
I don't know how to avoid that.

1879
02:06:57,000 --> 02:07:03,000
I think it's a jump over it, huh?

1880
02:07:03,000 --> 02:07:07,000
I'm assuming you had a jump over that because it'll just trigger it every single time.

1881
02:07:07,000 --> 02:07:17,000
You'll get hit by it every time.

1882
02:07:17,000 --> 02:07:24,000
Well, trying to rush it.

1883
02:07:24,000 --> 02:07:25,000
I tried to jump.

1884
02:07:25,000 --> 02:07:26,000
Did you hit the button?

1885
02:07:26,000 --> 02:07:27,000
Did you hear you heard the button?

1886
02:07:27,000 --> 02:07:28,000
You had to have heard the button.

1887
02:07:28,000 --> 02:07:32,000
I tried to jump and my guy crouched.

1888
02:07:32,000 --> 02:07:37,000
Or I have to sit in a certain spot on it.

1889
02:07:37,000 --> 02:07:42,000
I mean, I said I could actually get back to that part rather than just hold my eyes closed

1890
02:07:42,000 --> 02:07:44,000
like Mario was doing.

1891
02:07:44,000 --> 02:07:49,000
Let's get right on the front.

1892
02:07:49,000 --> 02:07:52,000
Oh boy, that didn't work.

1893
02:07:52,000 --> 02:07:53,000
No.

1894
02:07:53,000 --> 02:07:58,000
Oh, you can't hit that guy.

1895
02:07:58,000 --> 02:08:05,000
Shit.

1896
02:08:05,000 --> 02:08:12,000
This is a pain in the ass.

1897
02:08:12,000 --> 02:08:21,000
Okay.

1898
02:08:21,000 --> 02:08:25,000
So if I just walk on it, no.

1899
02:08:26,000 --> 02:08:30,000
Oh, it's just gone too fast.

1900
02:08:30,000 --> 02:08:35,000
It's gone too fast for my fucking brain to handle us.

1901
02:08:35,000 --> 02:08:40,000
I have to jump on it and then run underneath that thing and then not get hit by the giant

1902
02:08:40,000 --> 02:08:42,000
flame wake at the end of that.

1903
02:08:42,000 --> 02:08:44,000
And then jump over the guy's head.

1904
02:08:44,000 --> 02:08:45,000
I don't even know.

1905
02:08:45,000 --> 02:08:48,000
I was not in now.

1906
02:08:48,000 --> 02:08:52,000
I'm just being a fucking dummy.

1907
02:08:52,000 --> 02:08:58,000
I only have a few more tries at this.

1908
02:08:58,000 --> 02:09:03,000
And you know, it's just all repetition.

1909
02:09:03,000 --> 02:09:13,000
After doing this like 300 times, I would probably figure it all out.

1910
02:09:13,000 --> 02:09:15,000
Start at the end.

1911
02:09:15,000 --> 02:09:16,000
Walk forward.

1912
02:09:16,000 --> 02:09:20,000
I didn't do it fast enough.

1913
02:09:20,000 --> 02:09:21,000
What the hell?

1914
02:09:21,000 --> 02:09:25,000
How did he hit me?

1915
02:09:25,000 --> 02:09:30,000
I'm going to take this one down to 70 and I'm just skipping it.

1916
02:09:30,000 --> 02:09:35,000
You can call me the skipper.

1917
02:09:35,000 --> 02:09:43,000
This one is crazy crazy crazy crazy crazy crazy crazy crazy crazy.

1918
02:09:43,000 --> 02:09:47,000
Almost.

1919
02:09:48,000 --> 02:09:51,000
Oh, again, it's just trial and error.

1920
02:09:51,000 --> 02:09:54,000
There was no way for me to know that that was going to fall.

1921
02:09:54,000 --> 02:09:58,000
There was absolutely no conceivable way I would have known that that thing was going to

1922
02:09:58,000 --> 02:09:59,000
fall.

1923
02:09:59,000 --> 02:10:08,000
And unless I died by it, like I just did.

1924
02:10:08,000 --> 02:10:13,000
Like that was just somebody just threw a fucking beer in my face.

1925
02:10:13,000 --> 02:10:15,000
Now that is not a good idea.

1926
02:10:16,000 --> 02:10:20,000
At least I might have this down at least this part.

1927
02:10:20,000 --> 02:10:24,000
Okay, I'll take the hit here.

1928
02:10:24,000 --> 02:10:26,000
Here it comes.

1929
02:10:26,000 --> 02:10:27,000
Oh shit.

1930
02:10:27,000 --> 02:10:36,000
What did I do there?

1931
02:10:36,000 --> 02:10:40,000
What did I do there?

1932
02:10:40,000 --> 02:10:41,000
And I just flipped out.

1933
02:10:41,000 --> 02:10:47,000
I just got to, I got to, might be okay.

1934
02:10:47,000 --> 02:10:52,000
I still might be all right.

1935
02:10:52,000 --> 02:10:55,000
Screw you, boo.

1936
02:10:55,000 --> 02:11:10,000
Oh my god, I had the mobar.

1937
02:11:11,000 --> 02:11:13,000
I said 70.

1938
02:11:13,000 --> 02:11:22,000
Once it gets down to 70, that's when we, that's when I throw the skip into this one.

1939
02:11:22,000 --> 02:11:31,000
At least I figured out this first part.

1940
02:11:31,000 --> 02:11:35,000
Although it's so hard to even determine what time it went to leave.

1941
02:11:35,000 --> 02:11:37,000
I'm stuck here.

1942
02:11:37,000 --> 02:11:39,000
I'm stuck here forever.

1943
02:11:40,000 --> 02:11:44,000
All I can potentially do is like, I don't even know.

1944
02:11:44,000 --> 02:11:45,000
I'm not even sure.

1945
02:11:45,000 --> 02:11:47,000
I'm just gonna hit this button.

1946
02:11:47,000 --> 02:11:48,000
Just go.

1947
02:11:48,000 --> 02:11:49,000
No.

1948
02:11:49,000 --> 02:11:56,000
There was a flower down there I could possibly have gotten.

1949
02:11:56,000 --> 02:11:59,000
This is excruciating.

1950
02:11:59,000 --> 02:12:09,000
At least I'm not gonna hit by the first block of guy.

1951
02:12:09,000 --> 02:12:13,000
Okay, good.

1952
02:12:13,000 --> 02:12:21,000
Shit, shit, shit, shit.

1953
02:12:21,000 --> 02:12:23,000
I'm gonna try to get this.

1954
02:12:23,000 --> 02:12:25,000
It's totally worth it.

1955
02:12:25,000 --> 02:12:27,000
Or is it?

1956
02:12:27,000 --> 02:12:31,000
I think I'm gonna trigger the fall.

1957
02:12:31,000 --> 02:12:32,000
I kicked it.

1958
02:12:32,000 --> 02:12:33,000
I just kicked it.

1959
02:12:33,000 --> 02:12:36,000
I kicked the damn thing.

1960
02:12:36,000 --> 02:12:47,000
Well, this is where, here we are.

1961
02:12:47,000 --> 02:12:49,000
Here we are.

1962
02:12:49,000 --> 02:12:53,000
And of course, of course, the creator of this level made sure that if you try to rush

1963
02:12:53,000 --> 02:13:02,000
this beginning, you're just totally 100% going to screw yourself.

1964
02:13:02,000 --> 02:13:10,000
You got hit by the dumb easy thing.

1965
02:13:10,000 --> 02:13:12,000
That's gonna be it.

1966
02:13:12,000 --> 02:13:13,000
This one's done.

1967
02:13:13,000 --> 02:13:14,000
Yep.

1968
02:13:14,000 --> 02:13:18,000
I'm gonna, you know what?

1969
02:13:18,000 --> 02:13:20,000
I'm gonna try, I'll try the door.

1970
02:13:20,000 --> 02:13:21,000
I'll try the door.

1971
02:13:21,000 --> 02:13:27,000
If the door puts me at the beginning of the level, I'm going to skip this level.

1972
02:13:27,000 --> 02:13:31,000
I'm gonna just pull up the start menu and say get me out of here.

1973
02:13:31,000 --> 02:13:32,000
Whoops.

1974
02:13:32,000 --> 02:13:38,000
No one in the door.

1975
02:13:38,000 --> 02:13:53,000
Oh, boy, oh boy, oh boy.

1976
02:13:53,000 --> 02:13:58,000
Stay with me, stay with me, stay with me, stay.

1977
02:13:58,000 --> 02:13:59,000
What?

1978
02:13:59,000 --> 02:14:04,000
What the fuck?

1979
02:14:04,000 --> 02:14:06,000
No, touch it.

1980
02:14:06,000 --> 02:14:10,000
I did it.

1981
02:14:10,000 --> 02:14:13,000
I did it.

1982
02:14:13,000 --> 02:14:17,000
Thank God.

1983
02:14:17,000 --> 02:14:21,000
Got it.

1984
02:14:21,000 --> 02:14:29,000
I only wasted like 20 lives on that one.

1985
02:14:29,000 --> 02:14:35,000
This one's called Bling Bling.

1986
02:14:35,000 --> 02:14:39,000
Interesting.

1987
02:14:39,000 --> 02:14:42,000
I had to go way before that I currently did.

1988
02:14:43,000 --> 02:14:49,000
Because now I'm just at the mercy of this.

1989
02:14:49,000 --> 02:14:52,000
Oh, that did okay.

1990
02:14:52,000 --> 02:14:53,000
Go.

1991
02:14:53,000 --> 02:14:54,000
I just got to run.

1992
02:14:54,000 --> 02:14:55,000
Otherwise, you just get overwhelmed.

1993
02:14:55,000 --> 02:14:58,000
Actually, I might be able to get the mushroom before they all get over here.

1994
02:14:58,000 --> 02:15:01,000
Yeah, I can.

1995
02:15:01,000 --> 02:15:02,000
I definitely can.

1996
02:15:02,000 --> 02:15:03,000
I was supposed to quick enough.

1997
02:15:03,000 --> 02:15:05,000
I didn't use my quick draw.

1998
02:15:05,000 --> 02:15:06,000
Showdown skills.

1999
02:15:06,000 --> 02:15:13,000
I would have had it if I wasn't such a fucking dumbass.

2000
02:15:13,000 --> 02:15:20,000
Got it.

2001
02:15:20,000 --> 02:15:25,000
Let's do it.

2002
02:15:25,000 --> 02:15:27,000
Down arrow right here.

2003
02:15:27,000 --> 02:15:29,000
Up arrow.

2004
02:15:29,000 --> 02:15:30,000
Easy though.

2005
02:15:30,000 --> 02:15:34,000
I don't want to get, see?

2006
02:15:34,000 --> 02:15:35,000
That's why I was being easy.

2007
02:15:35,000 --> 02:15:42,000
See this probably what I have to go down there?

2008
02:15:42,000 --> 02:15:43,000
I think I got it.

2009
02:15:43,000 --> 02:15:46,000
Not entirely sure what's going on, but I can just go in this.

2010
02:15:46,000 --> 02:15:47,000
Let's hope I can.

2011
02:15:47,000 --> 02:15:54,000
Alright, I'm gonna figure this out.

2012
02:15:54,000 --> 02:15:57,000
Let's try this.

2013
02:15:57,000 --> 02:15:59,000
Don't get it yet.

2014
02:15:59,000 --> 02:16:06,000
Just know it's okay.

2015
02:16:06,000 --> 02:16:09,000
Something's going on over here.

2016
02:16:09,000 --> 02:16:13,000
I need to see.

2017
02:16:13,000 --> 02:16:14,000
What?

2018
02:16:14,000 --> 02:16:15,000
What?

2019
02:16:15,000 --> 02:16:16,000
Yes.

2020
02:16:16,000 --> 02:16:17,000
Um.

2021
02:16:17,000 --> 02:16:24,000
Hmm.

2022
02:16:24,000 --> 02:16:31,000
There we go.

2023
02:16:31,000 --> 02:16:36,000
There we go.

2024
02:16:36,000 --> 02:16:38,000
I knew it.

2025
02:16:38,000 --> 02:16:39,000
I knew what was going to happen.

2026
02:16:39,000 --> 02:16:40,000
I knew what was going to happen.

2027
02:16:40,000 --> 02:16:47,000
I fucking did it anyways.

2028
02:16:47,000 --> 02:16:54,000
Yeah, that kind of, that kind of needed that koopa.

2029
02:16:54,000 --> 02:16:58,000
No, I was looking at chat.

2030
02:16:58,000 --> 02:17:01,000
I think that's a, yeah, see you later.

2031
02:17:01,000 --> 02:17:06,000
That's a done deal right there.

2032
02:17:06,000 --> 02:17:14,000
Oh my god.

2033
02:17:14,000 --> 02:17:15,000
Oh my god.

2034
02:17:15,000 --> 02:17:16,000
I just shook my head.

2035
02:17:16,000 --> 02:17:21,000
My head just shook around.

2036
02:17:21,000 --> 02:17:28,000
Get out of my face.

2037
02:17:28,000 --> 02:17:33,000
Alright, now I need to get, I need to save that shell.

2038
02:17:33,000 --> 02:17:40,000
I'm gonna clear out all these things because they will kill me.

2039
02:17:40,000 --> 02:17:43,000
I'm certain of it.

2040
02:17:43,000 --> 02:17:46,000
No lag I too.

2041
02:17:46,000 --> 02:17:47,000
Oh boy.

2042
02:17:47,000 --> 02:17:48,000
Okay.

2043
02:17:48,000 --> 02:17:53,000
Well.

2044
02:17:53,000 --> 02:17:58,000
I want you to come over here.

2045
02:17:58,000 --> 02:17:59,000
Um.

2046
02:17:59,000 --> 02:18:01,000
Oh boy.

2047
02:18:01,000 --> 02:18:02,000
Is that going to come back?

2048
02:18:02,000 --> 02:18:07,000
That's going to come back to me.

2049
02:18:07,000 --> 02:18:11,000
Not the I didn't follow him.

2050
02:18:11,000 --> 02:18:13,000
Shit.

2051
02:18:13,000 --> 02:18:16,000
Oh no, no, I'm dead.

2052
02:18:16,000 --> 02:18:19,000
Just barely made that so I can go up here.

2053
02:18:19,000 --> 02:18:22,000
Even though I screwed that up, I can still go up here.

2054
02:18:22,000 --> 02:18:26,000
Hopefully this will bring me around.

2055
02:18:26,000 --> 02:18:27,000
Don't even grab it.

2056
02:18:27,000 --> 02:18:33,000
It's not even worth me attempting to get that.

2057
02:18:33,000 --> 02:18:34,000
Bounce it all over the place.

2058
02:18:34,000 --> 02:18:36,000
Shit's bouncing all over the place.

2059
02:18:36,000 --> 02:18:43,000
Come on.

2060
02:18:43,000 --> 02:18:50,000
I'm reading the chat again.

2061
02:18:50,000 --> 02:18:51,000
I'm looking.

2062
02:18:51,000 --> 02:18:53,000
Okay, time to stop looking.

2063
02:18:53,000 --> 02:18:56,000
I was gonna say something to me that was going to respond to somebody good.

2064
02:18:56,000 --> 02:18:58,000
No, we can't.

2065
02:18:58,000 --> 02:18:59,000
Oh god.

2066
02:18:59,000 --> 02:19:00,000
Damn it.

2067
02:19:00,000 --> 02:19:05,000
Damn it.

2068
02:19:05,000 --> 02:19:06,000
Oh.

2069
02:19:06,000 --> 02:19:07,000
Fuck.

2070
02:19:07,000 --> 02:19:12,000
I gotta be focused for this one.

2071
02:19:12,000 --> 02:19:15,000
I missed it.

2072
02:19:15,000 --> 02:19:19,000
I missed it.

2073
02:19:19,000 --> 02:19:23,000
Hello, Otto.

2074
02:19:23,000 --> 02:19:27,000
Missed it again.

2075
02:19:27,000 --> 02:19:32,000
You know, I'm just, I think I just gotta stop going for it.

2076
02:19:32,000 --> 02:19:34,000
It's like a 50-50 shot.

2077
02:19:34,000 --> 02:19:38,000
I'm gonna hit it or not.

2078
02:19:38,000 --> 02:19:41,000
Okay, well that's what's down there.

2079
02:19:41,000 --> 02:19:49,000
Found what's down there.

2080
02:19:49,000 --> 02:19:55,000
I'm supposed to stop doing that.

2081
02:19:55,000 --> 02:19:57,000
All right, I need to stop fucking this up.

2082
02:19:57,000 --> 02:20:00,000
That would be great.

2083
02:20:00,000 --> 02:20:05,000
I've got a better idea.

2084
02:20:05,000 --> 02:20:12,000
I like this idea much better.

2085
02:20:12,000 --> 02:20:16,000
I don't like this idea because I needed to keep one of those things alive.

2086
02:20:16,000 --> 02:20:21,000
Is it even possible for me to do this one?

2087
02:20:21,000 --> 02:20:23,000
Kind of.

2088
02:20:23,000 --> 02:20:24,000
No.

2089
02:20:24,000 --> 02:20:27,000
Holy shit.

2090
02:20:27,000 --> 02:20:34,000
Just shooting up at me now.

2091
02:20:34,000 --> 02:20:37,000
Oh, come on.

2092
02:20:37,000 --> 02:20:38,000
The thing is about to disappear.

2093
02:20:38,000 --> 02:20:42,000
The thing is about to disappear.

2094
02:20:42,000 --> 02:20:47,000
That was disappearing as we spoke.

2095
02:20:47,000 --> 02:20:51,000
Nope, I got stuck.

2096
02:20:51,000 --> 02:20:56,000
Got stuck.

2097
02:20:56,000 --> 02:21:21,000
Oh, that was not that was luck.

2098
02:21:21,000 --> 02:21:30,000
That's all that was.

2099
02:21:30,000 --> 02:21:31,000
Get it.

2100
02:21:31,000 --> 02:21:33,000
Do it.

2101
02:21:33,000 --> 02:21:36,000
Yeah.

2102
02:21:36,000 --> 02:21:38,000
That's all that did.

2103
02:21:38,000 --> 02:21:42,000
That was the point of that.

2104
02:21:42,000 --> 02:21:43,000
Okay.

2105
02:21:43,000 --> 02:21:50,000
Apparently that was the point of that one.

2106
02:21:50,000 --> 02:21:56,000
I don't know if it's like, do I just, I guess I have to go up there.

2107
02:21:56,000 --> 02:22:08,000
This was kind of a necessary trip, I guess.

2108
02:22:08,000 --> 02:22:13,000
I'm not a small, I can go down that room, right?

2109
02:22:13,000 --> 02:22:20,000
I can't find anything.

2110
02:22:20,000 --> 02:22:25,000
Fuck.

2111
02:22:25,000 --> 02:22:31,000
Yeah, I got to get in the cloud.

2112
02:22:31,000 --> 02:22:39,000
I have to go in that cloud.

2113
02:22:39,000 --> 02:22:43,000
The cloud is necessary for that.

2114
02:22:43,000 --> 02:22:46,000
So it's get cloud.

2115
02:22:46,000 --> 02:22:48,000
Where's cloud guy?

2116
02:22:48,000 --> 02:22:50,000
There's cloud guy.

2117
02:22:50,000 --> 02:22:52,000
Give me your cloud.

2118
02:22:52,000 --> 02:22:55,000
Let's move.

2119
02:22:55,000 --> 02:23:00,000
At least now I know what to do.

2120
02:23:00,000 --> 02:23:06,000
This should go much more smoothly next time.

2121
02:23:06,000 --> 02:23:09,000
I'll kill him and just go right over here.

2122
02:23:09,000 --> 02:23:10,000
Yeah.

2123
02:23:10,000 --> 02:23:17,000
Let's go there.

2124
02:23:17,000 --> 02:23:20,000
Hope he's such a goofball.

2125
02:23:20,000 --> 02:23:30,000
I keep killing myself because I'm glancing down at my other screen and dying.

2126
02:23:30,000 --> 02:23:41,000
Fuck me.

2127
02:23:41,000 --> 02:23:43,000
Oh, that was, oh, that was great.

2128
02:23:43,000 --> 02:23:49,000
What a real not waste of fucking time that was.

2129
02:23:49,000 --> 02:23:56,000
I'm supposed to rage quit this game and play like fucking iPad games.

2130
02:23:56,000 --> 02:23:59,000
See now I'm getting mad at him, just fucking pissed off.

2131
02:23:59,000 --> 02:24:03,000
This shit's just going downhill.

2132
02:24:03,000 --> 02:24:04,000
You know what I mean?

2133
02:24:04,000 --> 02:24:05,000
You know what I mean?

2134
02:24:05,000 --> 02:24:07,000
Shit just goes fucking downhill.

2135
02:24:07,000 --> 02:24:10,000
And you just start getting real angry at shit.

2136
02:24:10,000 --> 02:24:11,000
Yeah, I don't get died.

2137
02:24:11,000 --> 02:24:15,000
I don't give a shit about that guy.

2138
02:24:15,000 --> 02:24:17,000
Give me one of these.

2139
02:24:17,000 --> 02:24:18,000
Get this dude.

2140
02:24:18,000 --> 02:24:21,000
I'm not going to get him yet.

2141
02:24:21,000 --> 02:24:25,000
Follow me all the way over here.

2142
02:24:25,000 --> 02:24:27,000
I'm going to jump up to this thing.

2143
02:24:27,000 --> 02:24:28,000
Got it.

2144
02:24:28,000 --> 02:24:29,000
Let's go.

2145
02:24:29,000 --> 02:24:30,000
Move, move, move.

2146
02:24:30,000 --> 02:24:31,000
I don't even care.

2147
02:24:31,000 --> 02:24:33,000
I don't even know what's in that thing.

2148
02:24:33,000 --> 02:24:35,000
This thing's going to run out.

2149
02:24:35,000 --> 02:24:36,000
Yeah, this is going to run out.

2150
02:24:36,000 --> 02:24:38,000
I just have to jump over the plant.

2151
02:24:38,000 --> 02:24:41,000
I think.

2152
02:24:41,000 --> 02:24:42,000
Yay!

2153
02:24:42,000 --> 02:24:44,000
At least I've made it.

2154
02:24:44,000 --> 02:24:46,000
Back to the place where I was going to lose.

2155
02:24:46,000 --> 02:24:51,000
Unless I can...

2156
02:24:52,000 --> 02:24:55,000
A new expert wasn't a good idea.

2157
02:24:58,000 --> 02:25:00,000
A new expert wasn't a good idea.

2158
02:25:00,000 --> 02:25:09,000
Instead of just made my little shitty dumb shit level.

2159
02:25:09,000 --> 02:25:11,000
Alright, last try.

2160
02:25:11,000 --> 02:25:17,000
This is it.

2161
02:25:17,000 --> 02:25:20,000
Good job.

2162
02:25:20,000 --> 02:25:21,000
Very good.

2163
02:25:21,000 --> 02:25:24,000
Good work.

2164
02:25:24,000 --> 02:25:27,000
I get over here where is a cloud man.

2165
02:25:27,000 --> 02:25:35,000
I don't want to get a safe trip to that next area.

2166
02:25:35,000 --> 02:25:37,000
And then I guess, you know what?

2167
02:25:37,000 --> 02:25:38,000
Hold on.

2168
02:25:38,000 --> 02:25:39,000
What's in here?

2169
02:25:39,000 --> 02:25:40,000
It's a mushroom.

2170
02:25:40,000 --> 02:25:41,000
It didn't even match.

2171
02:25:41,000 --> 02:25:46,000
Just hit me.

2172
02:25:46,000 --> 02:25:49,000
Why would I give you a mushroom right here?

2173
02:25:49,000 --> 02:25:50,000
I don't know.

2174
02:25:50,000 --> 02:25:51,000
There's no reason to have it.

2175
02:26:02,000 --> 02:26:06,000
If I were to take a wild guess, it would be something along the lines though.

2176
02:26:06,000 --> 02:26:07,000
I'll take that.

2177
02:26:07,000 --> 02:26:10,000
Yes, I would love one of those.

2178
02:26:10,000 --> 02:26:15,000
Just break all this shit.

2179
02:26:15,000 --> 02:26:16,000
Give me those mushrooms.

2180
02:26:16,000 --> 02:26:18,000
Give me the fucking mushroom.

2181
02:26:20,000 --> 02:26:29,000
I want to tell you, every time I say it's the last try I'm doing it.

2182
02:26:29,000 --> 02:26:37,000
Every time.

2183
02:26:37,000 --> 02:26:40,000
I say, this is the last one.

2184
02:26:40,000 --> 02:26:48,000
And then I beat it.

2185
02:26:48,000 --> 02:26:54,000
I'm going to use a cheap cheap.

2186
02:26:54,000 --> 02:27:07,000
With a name like Castle cheap cheap, feel like it's not going to be the most fair of levels.

2187
02:27:07,000 --> 02:27:14,000
Okay, well that's that's

2188
02:27:14,000 --> 02:27:20,000
Holy shit

2189
02:27:20,000 --> 02:27:30,000
Die don't even know I don't even know

2190
02:27:30,000 --> 02:27:34,000
There's a lot of questions I have on this one I slid down its own

2191
02:27:34,000 --> 02:27:40,000
Because Mario likes to hold on to the wall in this version of the Mario games

2192
02:27:40,000 --> 02:27:44,000
You need to let go Mario let go

2193
02:27:44,000 --> 02:27:54,000
I guess you just a go like this

2194
02:27:54,000 --> 02:28:01,000
Oh shit

2195
02:28:01,000 --> 02:28:07,000
Cheap cheap

2196
02:28:07,000 --> 02:28:11,000
No you did it again

2197
02:28:11,000 --> 02:28:15,000
Don't tell me I'm the fucking wall

2198
02:28:15,000 --> 02:28:23,000
I can't touch any buttons otherwise we'll do that

2199
02:28:23,000 --> 02:28:25,000
Jump

2200
02:28:25,000 --> 02:28:30,000
It's such a good erratic pattern pulling those things shoot out

2201
02:28:30,000 --> 02:28:34,000
Let's give me let's take one second here to figure out what the hell is going on here

2202
02:28:34,000 --> 02:28:39,000
Okay, they jump all over the place I'm gonna have to do some wall jumps

2203
02:28:39,000 --> 02:28:44,000
I don't know what's in that box but I'm scared to go over and try and to do it

2204
02:28:44,000 --> 02:28:48,000
But here we go

2205
02:28:49,000 --> 02:28:55,000
Of course it's good to shoot one right there

2206
02:28:55,000 --> 02:29:08,000
So that's that's like a that's the I want to troll you thing right you get hit right by right when you land it goes

2207
02:29:08,000 --> 02:29:17,000
As long as I don't get hit by these things I should be okay at least somewhat okay staggered a little bit there we go

2208
02:29:17,000 --> 02:29:24,000
Just go do the jumps Mario please I want you to hold on to the walls this time

2209
02:29:24,000 --> 02:29:37,000
I it's gonna shoot oh you serious

2210
02:29:37,000 --> 02:29:44,000
What hit me was there oh the stupid piranha plant over there

2211
02:29:44,000 --> 02:29:52,000
Well at least I know that that first no I'm gonna hit that

2212
02:29:52,000 --> 02:29:56,000
The first one is the is okay I can get that no problem now

2213
02:29:56,000 --> 02:30:07,000
First one wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait

2214
02:30:07,000 --> 02:30:14,000
Wait a second Mario should be able to have a good clear view here

2215
02:30:14,000 --> 02:30:20,000
Mario please alright here we go

2216
02:30:20,000 --> 02:30:27,000
Here come the homing missiles

2217
02:30:27,000 --> 02:30:31,000
One end out just go

2218
02:30:31,000 --> 02:30:37,000
And of course of course that one piranha plant down to the lower left that didn't need to be there

2219
02:30:37,000 --> 02:30:45,000
That guy just was giggling to himself like oh god

2220
02:30:45,000 --> 02:30:55,000
I lost oh god why is my chattel screwed up what the fuck don't stand there again

2221
02:30:55,000 --> 02:31:01,000
Don't do that again please

2222
02:31:01,000 --> 02:31:07,000
Well I'm probably gonna run into the lives here but you know whatever

2223
02:31:14,000 --> 02:31:19,000
It takes me a while but I will I will beat it

2224
02:31:25,000 --> 02:31:38,000
I never played these Mario Wii U games so the way that he's playing in these walls

2225
02:31:38,000 --> 02:31:45,000
I'm trying to do it like it's a meat boy

2226
02:31:45,000 --> 02:31:50,000
There you go though those actually are a pretty long timer long enough I think

2227
02:31:50,000 --> 02:31:57,000
That's second one shoots a fish face out straight ahead

2228
02:31:57,000 --> 02:32:07,000
You know what no boy I don't know I knew it's gonna come out of some point

2229
02:32:07,000 --> 02:32:13,000
It's so hard to climb that up that with those fireballs going at every second being shot out

2230
02:32:14,000 --> 02:32:20,000
That piranha plant is such a pain in the ass

2231
02:32:20,000 --> 02:32:33,000
If I can figure out the fucking pattern to get around that piranha plant and things should go way more smoothly

2232
02:32:33,000 --> 02:32:39,000
Oh my god and it didn't he didn't do the jump

2233
02:32:39,000 --> 02:32:47,000
Pain in the balls

2234
02:32:47,000 --> 02:32:49,000
I'm gonna sit here

2235
02:32:49,000 --> 02:33:02,000
Then I can go shooting one of the time no she's three this three go to bill homing missiles

2236
02:33:04,000 --> 02:33:10,000
You didn't jump off it

2237
02:33:10,000 --> 02:33:20,000
I don't like you didn't jump off that head

2238
02:33:26,000 --> 02:33:30,000
You know you got to go quick here because you're coming to these guys

2239
02:33:34,000 --> 02:33:40,000
They're just so erratic

2240
02:33:40,000 --> 02:33:47,000
I should go right now

2241
02:33:53,000 --> 02:33:56,000
I don't know

2242
02:33:56,000 --> 02:34:01,000
What what what what what what what what what what what what what what what what happened

2243
02:34:01,000 --> 02:34:05,000
That's a wall I have to go I have to jump over the wall

2244
02:34:05,000 --> 02:34:10,000
I got right to the end there and I just had no idea what the hell that is

2245
02:34:10,000 --> 02:34:16,000
There's a wall there so you have to go over it

2246
02:34:16,000 --> 02:34:22,000
Right I mean what the hell was that

2247
02:34:32,000 --> 02:34:36,000
Oh my fucking god and it didn't jump again

2248
02:34:36,000 --> 02:34:39,000
Shit

2249
02:34:41,000 --> 02:34:45,000
Damn it

2250
02:34:45,000 --> 02:34:50,000
Once once I get to that part it really shouldn't be that difficult

2251
02:34:50,000 --> 02:34:54,000
I just didn't know that I had to go all that far over

2252
02:35:01,000 --> 02:35:04,000
Give him a mushroom so firefly

2253
02:35:04,000 --> 02:35:08,000
So firefly

2254
02:35:08,000 --> 02:35:11,000
That might have just helped a ton

2255
02:35:11,000 --> 02:35:16,000
No that's gonna get me killed that is gonna get me killed go down one of

2256
02:35:24,000 --> 02:35:26,000
Oh

2257
02:35:31,000 --> 02:35:38,000
I thought that that was still on his head I didn't think that was a you die position I thought that was still his head

2258
02:35:38,000 --> 02:35:45,000
I'm just scared when I actually get back over there because this guy doing her

2259
02:35:45,000 --> 02:35:50,000
When I get back over there the real just don't know where it ends

2260
02:36:01,000 --> 02:36:09,000
Every time I'm gonna get hit by that thing that's all

2261
02:36:09,000 --> 02:36:12,000
Holy fuck

2262
02:36:12,000 --> 02:36:15,000
Yeah now I just get I came too far over

2263
02:36:22,000 --> 02:36:29,000
I actually am enjoying this as hard on my brain as this is right now

2264
02:36:29,000 --> 02:36:32,000
It's actually still pretty fun

2265
02:36:32,000 --> 02:36:37,000
What is he doing over here get out of here

2266
02:36:37,000 --> 02:36:42,000
Cashal cheap cheap I'm gonna get hit by this it's been too long

2267
02:36:44,000 --> 02:36:47,000
I'm getting something wrong with that by the way

2268
02:36:47,000 --> 02:36:50,000
Fuck

2269
02:36:50,000 --> 02:36:54,000
Everything just went wrong on that one

2270
02:36:54,000 --> 02:36:58,000
Everything just went wrong on that one

2271
02:37:00,000 --> 02:37:04,000
Yeah I need to get the fire flower that's a good that you know that is a good idea I can get three hits three times

2272
02:37:06,000 --> 02:37:13,000
It's gonna happen I'm gonna get to the end of this one and I'm something else is gonna happen and then I'm gonna throw up blood

2273
02:37:17,000 --> 02:37:22,000
Fireflies in there I can't get it I'm not small hit me

2274
02:37:24,000 --> 02:37:26,000
Let's go

2275
02:37:30,000 --> 02:37:35,000
Oh come on

2276
02:37:35,000 --> 02:37:40,000
And I jumped off the fucking wall

2277
02:37:40,000 --> 02:37:43,000
Oh my god

2278
02:37:43,000 --> 02:37:46,000
That's the worst part about games of the wall jump

2279
02:37:46,000 --> 02:37:52,000
Like sometimes you just stick on the corner of a wall and you're not trying to and you'll just watch off

2280
02:37:52,000 --> 02:37:56,000
It happens quite frequently

2281
02:38:00,000 --> 02:38:05,000
I actually totally forgot that that's happened

2282
02:38:10,000 --> 02:38:13,000
He puts him in such fucking shitty places

2283
02:38:18,000 --> 02:38:25,000
Each one of those piranha shooter things is in the worst possible position to play this video game

2284
02:38:26,000 --> 02:38:32,000
They are in every single jumping trajectory and every single spot where you're like supposed to stand

2285
02:38:32,000 --> 02:38:37,000
And they're firing at these erratic fucking patterns

2286
02:38:37,000 --> 02:38:40,000
Forget about the firefly

2287
02:38:40,000 --> 02:38:47,000
I don't need it I don't need the firefly what I need to do is I need to get by this without getting hit three fucking two three times

2288
02:38:48,000 --> 02:38:55,000
Like of one two three gets three seconds for them to shoot that one

2289
02:38:56,000 --> 02:38:59,000
And you got the asshole behind you

2290
02:39:05,000 --> 02:39:07,000
Followed oh wow how

2291
02:39:11,000 --> 02:39:15,000
You have to jump over one of those bullets do I have to jump on a bullet

2292
02:39:16,000 --> 02:39:20,000
Get one to follow me and then launch over in the jump I think that's what I have to do

2293
02:39:22,000 --> 02:39:24,000
What a world

2294
02:39:29,000 --> 02:39:31,000
Salt

2295
02:39:31,000 --> 02:39:33,000
Yeah I am

2296
02:39:33,000 --> 02:39:36,000
This shit is fucking hard is all shit

2297
02:39:36,000 --> 02:39:38,000
I stuck too long

2298
02:39:46,000 --> 02:39:52,000
I mean I'm already this like this far I got to try to beat I can't let this one defeat me

2299
02:39:53,000 --> 02:39:56,000
We didn't do expert to stop it like level seven

2300
02:39:58,000 --> 02:40:04,000
I did expert to beat this because I want to beat this and I'm talking and nothing attention I've all it's over

2301
02:40:04,000 --> 02:40:06,000
I've already lost tire here we go

2302
02:40:06,000 --> 02:40:08,000
This is gonna be this is the one

2303
02:40:08,000 --> 02:40:10,000
This is gonna be the one

2304
02:40:10,000 --> 02:40:13,000
Number 33 that's my lucky number lucky number 33

2305
02:40:14,000 --> 02:40:16,000
Nice to call me that in high school 33

2306
02:40:19,000 --> 02:40:21,000
Let me show you why

2307
02:40:21,000 --> 02:40:24,000
Let me show you where I got the nickname 33

2308
02:40:24,000 --> 02:40:26,000
Because of that

2309
02:40:33,000 --> 02:40:35,000
I just got the fuck with 33 item

2310
02:40:36,000 --> 02:40:45,000
I did the thing with less than a fucking wall

2311
02:40:52,000 --> 02:40:54,000
Well again

2312
02:40:55,000 --> 02:40:58,000
I think my best impression of a fucking chimpanzee

2313
02:41:00,000 --> 02:41:03,000
All right you know high school used to call me fucking 31

2314
02:41:04,000 --> 02:41:06,000
I'll show you why

2315
02:41:06,000 --> 02:41:08,000
You want to know why?

2316
02:41:10,000 --> 02:41:13,000
This is why he's the cobbies to face to cobbie and I's gonna put 31

2317
02:41:15,000 --> 02:41:17,000
All you guys are gonna see why right now

2318
02:41:19,000 --> 02:41:22,000
Even the principal principal was like god damn I'm not the 31 you're so awesome

2319
02:41:23,000 --> 02:41:26,000
It's like yeah I know let me show you why principal

2320
02:41:26,000 --> 02:41:28,000
Big rubber

2321
02:41:28,000 --> 02:41:30,000
I wanted to do that

2322
02:41:30,000 --> 02:41:32,000
Here we go

2323
02:41:33,000 --> 02:41:35,000
Can't kill those with that

2324
02:41:39,000 --> 02:41:41,000
Can't kill those with that

2325
02:41:54,000 --> 02:41:56,000
Oh

2326
02:42:04,000 --> 02:42:08,000
This is more just see where that fish was

2327
02:42:21,000 --> 02:42:24,000
I think I need to take a shower after I play this game

2328
02:42:28,000 --> 02:42:30,000
Hey you know what these call back at high school

2329
02:42:30,000 --> 02:42:32,000
He's probably good all over fucking 29

2330
02:42:32,000 --> 02:42:34,000
Yeah

2331
02:42:34,000 --> 02:42:37,000
Yeah did I tell you that you died I even the principal

2332
02:42:37,000 --> 02:42:39,000
He used to say that he used to go 29

2333
02:42:39,000 --> 02:42:41,000
That's my favorite he's the best student in the world

2334
02:42:41,000 --> 02:42:45,000
Only I wish I could have missed my son

2335
02:42:45,000 --> 02:42:47,000
At least say

2336
02:42:47,000 --> 02:42:50,000
Is what they used to say about me

2337
02:42:50,000 --> 02:42:52,000
I don't know what to do

2338
02:42:52,000 --> 02:42:55,000
This needs to say about me, me never

2339
02:42:55,000 --> 02:42:57,000
That's only just about 29

2340
02:42:57,000 --> 02:42:59,000
Fuck

2341
02:42:59,000 --> 02:43:01,000
They used to call me

2342
02:43:01,000 --> 02:43:03,000
I said he used to call me

2343
02:43:03,000 --> 02:43:05,000
I said he used to say about me

2344
02:43:05,000 --> 02:43:07,000
I said he used to say about me

2345
02:43:07,000 --> 02:43:09,000
Fuck

2346
02:43:15,000 --> 02:43:17,000
What they used to call me

2347
02:43:17,000 --> 02:43:19,000
So he's coming

2348
02:43:19,000 --> 02:43:21,000
So he's coming back at high school

2349
02:43:48,000 --> 02:43:50,000
Hey

2350
02:43:50,000 --> 02:43:52,000
Did I ever tell you guys

2351
02:43:52,000 --> 02:43:54,000
What

2352
02:43:54,000 --> 02:43:58,000
They didn't use to call me when I was a nice one

2353
02:43:58,000 --> 02:44:01,000
A number that they did not ever call me was 27

2354
02:44:01,000 --> 02:44:03,000
You know

2355
02:44:05,000 --> 02:44:06,000
Ever

2356
02:44:06,000 --> 02:44:09,000
What a weird nickname that would be a number

2357
02:44:09,000 --> 02:44:12,000
Yeah, my nickname is a is a is a number

2358
02:44:12,000 --> 02:44:15,000
No, why no one ever called me that

2359
02:44:15,000 --> 02:44:18,000
Why would they?

2360
02:44:18,000 --> 02:44:22,000
You know, what kind of a strange person would you have to be?

2361
02:44:22,000 --> 02:44:26,000
To have that kind of a fucking stupid ass fucked up nickname

2362
02:44:26,000 --> 02:44:29,000
I don't know what happened there

2363
02:44:34,000 --> 02:44:36,000
God, this is so fucking hard

2364
02:44:36,000 --> 02:44:42,000
I just wish there wasn't any more after that debacle that is jumping over all their heads

2365
02:44:43,000 --> 02:44:47,000
There's a ton more there's a ton more just like RNG after that

2366
02:44:59,000 --> 02:45:01,000
I tell you shoots

2367
02:45:03,000 --> 02:45:05,000
Oh, wait a minute

2368
02:45:05,000 --> 02:45:07,000
Wait a minute, do you see what he's doing?

2369
02:45:07,000 --> 02:45:09,000
He's shooting the wall

2370
02:45:09,000 --> 02:45:12,000
We're gonna take this to our advantage because that's been the biggest pain in the ass

2371
02:45:12,000 --> 02:45:15,000
Wait for the shoots, let's go

2372
02:45:15,000 --> 02:45:17,000
Oh, wow

2373
02:45:17,000 --> 02:45:20,000
That just made everything so much easier

2374
02:45:24,000 --> 02:45:26,000
Oh, please shit

2375
02:45:31,000 --> 02:45:34,000
Come on, why did he have to jump that fucking high?

2376
02:45:34,000 --> 02:45:36,000
Why?

2377
02:45:36,000 --> 02:45:38,000
Why?

2378
02:45:39,000 --> 02:45:42,000
It's like the guy doesn't want you to beat this level

2379
02:45:42,000 --> 02:45:47,000
He's doing everything possible so you make sure you do not win

2380
02:45:50,000 --> 02:45:54,000
Fuck you throwing a throw like a fucking grandpa level in here

2381
02:45:54,000 --> 02:45:57,000
Sorry, I can't get a mushroom

2382
02:45:57,000 --> 02:46:00,000
I mean the uh, oh no, I can't get a no

2383
02:46:00,000 --> 02:46:03,000
Get this mushroom down here

2384
02:46:08,000 --> 02:46:10,000
So that was in a weird spot

2385
02:46:20,000 --> 02:46:23,000
Oh, come on, come on now

2386
02:46:23,000 --> 02:46:25,000
God, I get a stah...

2387
02:46:28,000 --> 02:46:30,000
That one was doomed from the beginning

2388
02:46:32,000 --> 02:46:35,000
That was doomed from the fucking beginning

2389
02:46:36,000 --> 02:46:39,000
Again, they're gonna have 500 seconds to beat this

2390
02:46:40,000 --> 02:46:44,000
See, somewhere this guy's gonna watch this whole thing

2391
02:46:44,000 --> 02:46:46,000
He's like, yeah, I did that

2392
02:46:46,000 --> 02:46:48,000
I made that

2393
02:46:50,000 --> 02:46:53,000
And I'm just gonna be like, dude

2394
02:46:53,000 --> 02:46:56,000
What the fuck?

2395
02:46:56,000 --> 02:46:58,000
You're a jerk

2396
02:46:59,000 --> 02:47:01,000
I didn't time that one, right?

2397
02:47:01,000 --> 02:47:04,000
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no

2398
02:47:04,000 --> 02:47:12,000
I wanted to go back and get the mushroom but you know whatever.

2399
02:47:12,000 --> 02:47:14,000
You take away the random fish at the bottom.

2400
02:47:14,000 --> 02:47:20,000
I probably would have beaten this like 25 minutes ago.

2401
02:47:20,000 --> 02:47:22,000
Not even choking.

2402
02:47:22,000 --> 02:47:27,000
You get these fucking random ass jumpy shithead fish out of the picture.

2403
02:47:27,000 --> 02:47:34,000
You got a victory.

2404
02:47:39,000 --> 02:47:41,000
It comes to fish.

2405
02:47:41,000 --> 02:47:47,000
Both fish.

2406
02:47:51,000 --> 02:47:55,000
First one.

2407
02:47:55,000 --> 02:48:00,000
It's okay easy easy easy it comes to pull it.

2408
02:48:00,000 --> 02:48:09,000
Come on.

2409
02:48:09,000 --> 02:48:10,000
I'm waiting for that fish.

2410
02:48:10,000 --> 02:48:12,000
Where's that fish that comes up here?

2411
02:48:12,000 --> 02:48:15,000
Does he come back?

2412
02:48:15,000 --> 02:48:16,000
These waps don't.

2413
02:48:16,000 --> 02:48:19,000
What are these the clompers?

2414
02:48:19,000 --> 02:48:23,000
The stompers or at least they don't come back.

2415
02:48:23,000 --> 02:48:25,000
Some fish is going to shoot right over here.

2416
02:48:25,000 --> 02:48:30,000
Fish is going to show up.

2417
02:48:30,000 --> 02:48:32,000
Why did that other one go away?

2418
02:48:32,000 --> 02:48:35,000
That's weird.

2419
02:48:35,000 --> 02:48:42,000
Oh god no oh god.

2420
02:48:42,000 --> 02:48:51,000
Damn it I should have just jumped on the fucking first one.

2421
02:48:52,000 --> 02:48:57,000
I should have just jumped on the first one.

2422
02:48:57,000 --> 02:49:00,000
Do not go on that other one.

2423
02:49:00,000 --> 02:49:05,000
You have to wait.

2424
02:49:05,000 --> 02:49:09,000
I could have had that too if I just didn't make that same mistake twice.

2425
02:49:09,000 --> 02:49:12,000
That's so annoying.

2426
02:49:12,000 --> 02:49:20,000
That is annoying.

2427
02:49:20,000 --> 02:49:22,000
You have to jump on these.

2428
02:49:22,000 --> 02:49:27,000
That's the ticket with that.

2429
02:49:27,000 --> 02:49:34,000
Hey you hey guess what happened?

2430
02:49:34,000 --> 02:49:36,000
I guess what happened?

2431
02:49:36,000 --> 02:49:40,000
I attached to the wall and jumped to the left because I grabbed onto the wall which is

2432
02:49:40,000 --> 02:49:42,000
like an inch fucking thick.

2433
02:49:42,000 --> 02:49:47,000
You're going to sweet.

2434
02:49:47,000 --> 02:49:49,000
I think I'm going to get it.

2435
02:49:49,000 --> 02:49:54,000
If I can get back to where I was I'm assuming that's near the end.

2436
02:49:54,000 --> 02:50:05,000
Why does that sometimes?

2437
02:50:05,000 --> 02:50:16,000
I'm going to wait till that whole thing cycles out of here because I will run into that.

2438
02:50:17,000 --> 02:50:23,000
Of course.

2439
02:50:23,000 --> 02:50:24,000
Okay.

2440
02:50:24,000 --> 02:50:26,000
Is the other one?

2441
02:50:26,000 --> 02:50:27,000
No.

2442
02:50:27,000 --> 02:50:28,000
Screwed.

2443
02:50:28,000 --> 02:50:33,000
Yeah I'm screwed.

2444
02:50:33,000 --> 02:50:41,000
I can't let this level beat me.

2445
02:50:41,000 --> 02:50:44,000
I'm not skipping it.

2446
02:50:44,000 --> 02:50:47,000
Getting that far and skipping it is like, no.

2447
02:50:47,000 --> 02:50:52,000
That's just like deflating a balloon and having to make that stupid fart noise.

2448
02:50:52,000 --> 02:50:59,000
That's how I would feel as a person if I skipped this right now.

2449
02:50:59,000 --> 02:51:04,000
No.

2450
02:51:04,000 --> 02:51:05,000
Shoot it.

2451
02:51:05,000 --> 02:51:10,000
Shoot you stupid thing.

2452
02:51:10,000 --> 02:51:11,000
Oh, go ahead.

2453
02:51:11,000 --> 02:51:12,000
A third one comes out.

2454
02:51:12,000 --> 02:51:13,000
It's over.

2455
02:51:13,000 --> 02:51:14,000
It's definitely done.

2456
02:51:14,000 --> 02:51:15,000
Yeah.

2457
02:51:15,000 --> 02:51:22,000
Now I can't even get past this fucking part.

2458
02:51:22,000 --> 02:51:24,000
Well, I might run into the lives.

2459
02:51:24,000 --> 02:51:32,000
If I run into the lives then I'm just going to go make a level and then and then and not play this fucking level.

2460
02:51:32,000 --> 02:51:35,000
Not play these people make the levels are so hard.

2461
02:51:35,000 --> 02:51:38,000
They take like a hundred attempts to beat.

2462
02:51:38,000 --> 02:51:41,000
That's not going to be my level.

2463
02:51:41,000 --> 02:51:47,000
My level is going to be sunshine and fucking rainbows.

2464
02:51:47,000 --> 02:51:51,000
And where everybody, you just got to even beat it.

2465
02:51:51,000 --> 02:51:53,000
If you try hard enough.

2466
02:51:53,000 --> 02:51:56,000
Oh no, I'm just talking.

2467
02:51:56,000 --> 02:51:59,000
I'm circling.

2468
02:51:59,000 --> 02:52:03,000
This thing's going to kill me.

2469
02:52:03,000 --> 02:52:04,000
Way too long.

2470
02:52:04,000 --> 02:52:07,000
Yeah, this is a this is pretty much done deal I think.

2471
02:52:07,000 --> 02:52:10,000
Yeah, this way too long.

2472
02:52:10,000 --> 02:52:25,000
I would make like a joke right now, but I'm just I'm just not even close to being happy.

2473
02:52:25,000 --> 02:52:27,000
I got to get like happy.

2474
02:52:27,000 --> 02:52:30,000
What's some happy things we can talk about?

2475
02:52:30,000 --> 02:52:35,000
But uh, funny rabbits.

2476
02:52:35,000 --> 02:52:37,000
They're pretty cool.

2477
02:52:37,000 --> 02:52:38,000
Just hit me.

2478
02:52:38,000 --> 02:52:39,000
I'm going to fly shit.

2479
02:52:39,000 --> 02:52:43,000
Give me the don't attach to the wall like a dumb shit face.

2480
02:52:43,000 --> 02:52:46,000
God, it doesn't have to be this Mario.

2481
02:52:46,000 --> 02:52:48,000
I fucking hate that mechanic.

2482
02:52:48,000 --> 02:52:50,000
I fucking despise that mechanic.

2483
02:52:50,000 --> 02:52:54,000
They're like, get in, get in, get in, hang on walls.

2484
02:52:54,000 --> 02:52:55,000
It's serious to me.

2485
02:52:55,000 --> 02:52:59,000
We want to fucking throw up.

2486
02:52:59,000 --> 02:53:17,000
Dude, this one's going to be the hardest one of this whole.

2487
02:53:17,000 --> 02:53:22,000
All the other ones were like dip like this is what level 6, level 7.

2488
02:53:22,000 --> 02:53:24,000
The other ones were hard, but they were like,

2489
02:53:24,000 --> 02:53:26,000
completely in like 20 or 30 attempts.

2490
02:53:26,000 --> 02:53:30,000
This is still fucking doing this shit.

2491
02:53:30,000 --> 02:53:40,000
This is like a 100 attempt level.

2492
02:53:40,000 --> 02:53:46,000
Do it, shoot it.

2493
02:53:46,000 --> 02:53:48,000
Not enough air.

2494
02:53:48,000 --> 02:53:49,000
I don't have any momentum either.

2495
02:53:49,000 --> 02:53:50,000
This could be.

2496
02:53:50,000 --> 02:53:51,000
This could be.

2497
02:53:51,000 --> 02:53:58,000
Yeah.

2498
02:53:58,000 --> 02:54:02,000
Damn it.

2499
02:54:02,000 --> 02:54:06,000
This is the one.

2500
02:54:06,000 --> 02:54:08,000
This is going to be the one.

2501
02:54:22,000 --> 02:54:43,000
No, I landed on that thing.

2502
02:54:43,000 --> 02:54:49,000
I don't know how many times I've been killed by latching onto the wall and trying to jump.

2503
02:54:49,000 --> 02:54:56,000
It's the worst thing.

2504
02:54:56,000 --> 02:55:17,000
Come on now.

2505
02:55:17,000 --> 02:55:24,000
I should wait for like one or two cycles for this.

2506
02:55:24,000 --> 02:55:29,000
Yeah.

2507
02:55:29,000 --> 02:55:37,000
Oh god.

2508
02:55:37,000 --> 02:55:45,000
Fuck.

2509
02:55:45,000 --> 02:55:55,000
I will prevail.

2510
02:55:55,000 --> 02:56:24,000
I had hit me.

2511
02:56:24,000 --> 02:56:33,000
Oh god.

2512
02:56:33,000 --> 02:56:42,000
I have sweaty ass hands.

2513
02:56:42,000 --> 02:56:49,000
That was a good run.

2514
02:56:49,000 --> 02:56:56,000
I have a good run.

2515
02:56:56,000 --> 02:57:04,000
I don't have any attempts left.

2516
02:57:04,000 --> 02:57:17,000
I have seen the same thing so many times that like by certs you think.

2517
02:57:17,000 --> 02:57:24,000
Things are blending together in my brain.

2518
02:57:24,000 --> 02:57:39,000
What the fuck is going on?

2519
02:57:39,000 --> 02:57:43,000
Why did I just do that again?

2520
02:57:43,000 --> 02:57:48,000
Oh man.

2521
02:57:48,000 --> 02:57:55,000
Why am I overthinking that one so much?

2522
02:57:55,000 --> 02:57:58,000
Boy.

2523
02:57:58,000 --> 02:58:01,000
Boy.

2524
02:58:01,000 --> 02:58:08,000
I was looking at chat.

2525
02:58:08,000 --> 02:58:13,000
I need to slow down there.

2526
02:58:13,000 --> 02:58:20,000
I'm getting there more reliably.

2527
02:58:20,000 --> 02:58:25,000
I'm getting there more reliably than I was before.

2528
02:58:25,000 --> 02:58:33,000
I should chew the other one.

2529
02:58:34,000 --> 02:58:43,000
I should be able to be small here.

2530
02:58:43,000 --> 02:58:48,000
I need to be small here.

2531
02:58:48,000 --> 02:58:52,000
I need to be small there.

2532
02:58:52,000 --> 02:58:56,000
I need to be small there.

2533
02:58:56,000 --> 02:59:03,000
Got a firefly.

2534
02:59:03,000 --> 02:59:11,000
I need to be small there.

2535
02:59:11,000 --> 02:59:17,000
I think I can get back there pretty much every time now.

2536
02:59:17,000 --> 02:59:21,000
I don't have many attempts.

2537
02:59:21,000 --> 02:59:26,000
No, I just fucked it all up. I gotta wait till that all goes all the way over

2538
02:59:31,000 --> 02:59:34,000
It is shoot it shoot it. That's all right

2539
02:59:41,000 --> 02:59:43,000
Nope, oh boy

2540
02:59:44,000 --> 02:59:47,000
Yeah, I don't know I don't know if I'm gonna do it

2541
02:59:47,000 --> 02:59:54,000
I don't know if I'm gonna do it. This is like 45 lives on this level

2542
02:59:58,000 --> 03:00:03,000
You don't need to get I need to get like the Wii U Pro controller whatever hell it is because I'm playing on the fucking brick

2543
03:00:05,000 --> 03:00:07,000
That's like already like a hindrance

2544
03:00:07,000 --> 03:00:09,000
I

2545
03:00:15,000 --> 03:00:19,000
Really wish I wasn't on this like I'm holding onto a

2546
03:00:23,000 --> 03:00:25,000
Handle bars on a bicycle

2547
03:00:27,000 --> 03:00:29,000
Only wipe my hands down

2548
03:00:30,000 --> 03:00:32,000
It prepared

2549
03:00:34,000 --> 03:00:36,000
I've put in the other eye pad on the ground

2550
03:00:38,000 --> 03:00:40,000
Let's get ready

2551
03:00:43,000 --> 03:00:49,000
No, fuck shoot it shoot another one shoot another one

2552
03:01:07,000 --> 03:01:10,000
Oh my god, I didn't jump on it

2553
03:01:11,000 --> 03:01:16,000
This that quarter of second delay whatever it is from this thing is really really putting a

2554
03:01:17,000 --> 03:01:19,000
stake in my ass

2555
03:01:25,000 --> 03:01:29,000
Big time the stuff like that should just never happen

2556
03:01:30,000 --> 03:01:34,000
But because this stupid input delay

2557
03:01:34,000 --> 03:01:36,000
It's happened

2558
03:01:44,000 --> 03:01:49,000
Like see I should never be missing these but for some fucked up reason what happens

2559
03:01:53,000 --> 03:02:00,000
Yeah, where should I have like a 145 second input delay I'm gonna cry about let's go fuck it

2560
03:02:04,000 --> 03:02:06,000
Yeah

2561
03:02:08,000 --> 03:02:10,000
There we go I wanted to do that

2562
03:02:15,000 --> 03:02:21,000
That really is causing me so many problems though if I'm going to be totally frank

2563
03:02:21,000 --> 03:02:35,000
Baby rage let's see the chat fill up with baby rage

2564
03:02:42,000 --> 03:02:47,000
Come on doing that shit that's the type of shit that can't happen

2565
03:02:48,000 --> 03:02:50,000
That gets me in a water trouble

2566
03:02:51,000 --> 03:02:53,000
You

2567
03:03:03,000 --> 03:03:07,000
Okay, please please don't do it again. Holy shit. It almost just happened again

2568
03:03:09,000 --> 03:03:11,000
Bullapill don't even think about it

2569
03:03:22,000 --> 03:03:32,000
What the fuck what whoa he could do he didn't do that before he did not do that last time he did not do that last time

2570
03:03:33,000 --> 03:03:35,000
What on earth just happened

2571
03:03:39,000 --> 03:03:42,000
I have to think about this because it's right there I

2572
03:03:46,000 --> 03:03:48,000
Just don't know

2573
03:03:48,000 --> 03:03:50,000
I

2574
03:03:50,000 --> 03:03:53,000
Can't jump over that I can take the hit but

2575
03:03:55,000 --> 03:03:57,000
Jump over it now maybe

2576
03:03:59,000 --> 03:04:01,000
Well gotta go now

2577
03:04:07,000 --> 03:04:12,000
This even more after that I was certain I was 100% certain that the end was gonna be right there

2578
03:04:13,000 --> 03:04:19,000
At least I just was thinking too much about it. Oh

2579
03:04:20,000 --> 03:04:25,000
Man, this is very this is very very very very very very very because there's now there's more for me to memorize

2580
03:04:27,000 --> 03:04:29,000
At that I have to like memorize that part

2581
03:04:33,000 --> 03:04:35,000
Oh, that was just that was just sloppy

2582
03:04:42,000 --> 03:04:44,000
Oh

2583
03:04:47,000 --> 03:04:49,000
Yeah, we get real sloppy that came way too close

2584
03:04:55,000 --> 03:04:57,000
Regardless I'm making a level after this

2585
03:04:59,000 --> 03:05:01,000
Fuck all this hard shit

2586
03:05:02,000 --> 03:05:08,000
Your your name your level is this level's cheap how how dare you

2587
03:05:13,000 --> 03:05:15,000
You

2588
03:05:19,000 --> 03:05:21,000
Okay

2589
03:05:33,000 --> 03:05:35,000
Well, there he is

2590
03:05:43,000 --> 03:05:46,000
There he comes don't do that again

2591
03:05:48,000 --> 03:05:50,000
Why did he didn't do it this time?

2592
03:05:50,000 --> 03:05:55,000
Of course he didn't and now he's up here with me now he's up here with me

2593
03:06:02,000 --> 03:06:06,000
No, I don't know I don't know if I can do it. I don't know I just don't know

2594
03:06:06,000 --> 03:06:15,000
Why do they have to come up and start throwing that guy has done something fucking weird the last two times I've gotten there

2595
03:06:16,000 --> 03:06:18,000
First he stomps through the ground

2596
03:06:19,000 --> 03:06:27,000
And then this guy jumps up through the little platform where he like lives and is ready to throw an axe at me and I can't like think

2597
03:06:36,000 --> 03:06:38,000
Oh

2598
03:06:54,000 --> 03:06:57,000
Get out of here all you fishes please please go on your merry way

2599
03:06:58,000 --> 03:07:00,000
Bullet bill is coming down here right now

2600
03:07:01,000 --> 03:07:03,000
Thanks

2601
03:07:04,000 --> 03:07:06,000
I hope he doesn't do that

2602
03:07:07,000 --> 03:07:09,000
Hope he does not do that again

2603
03:07:12,000 --> 03:07:15,000
All right, what are the weird shit that you're gonna do this time buddy?

2604
03:07:19,000 --> 03:07:22,000
Good he didn't do like anything stupidly strange this time

2605
03:07:28,000 --> 03:07:30,000
Okay

2606
03:07:30,000 --> 03:07:35,000
All right, I just don't know what happens over here wait for them to get by

2607
03:07:37,000 --> 03:07:39,000
I have a second there's a thing to jump on

2608
03:07:40,000 --> 03:07:42,000
I do I do I have an momentum?

2609
03:07:44,000 --> 03:07:46,000
Not sure

2610
03:07:46,000 --> 03:07:50,000
Nothing else is gonna jump up at me. I've gone past that point

2611
03:07:51,000 --> 03:07:53,000
Except for those

2612
03:07:53,000 --> 03:07:55,000
I

2613
03:07:57,000 --> 03:08:02,000
Mushroom give it to me don't know what's over here, but I have to jump off this guy

2614
03:08:04,000 --> 03:08:08,000
You gotta be fucking kidding me that's it right there that's the end I

2615
03:08:09,000 --> 03:08:14,000
Apparently didn't have enough speed that's literally the end right there too

2616
03:08:15,000 --> 03:08:20,000
There's a Bowser there who knows what kind of fucked up Bowser's gonna be over there. He's gonna be like five of them

2617
03:08:23,000 --> 03:08:25,000
Oh

2618
03:08:27,000 --> 03:08:29,000
Down to the final three attempts

2619
03:08:32,000 --> 03:08:42,000
I hope you're enjoying this I hope I hope it's at least entertaining to watch me fail at this level like literally 52 times

2620
03:08:48,000 --> 03:08:52,000
Hey, I did it again get back to square one square one square one

2621
03:08:53,000 --> 03:08:55,000
Slow it down

2622
03:08:56,000 --> 03:08:58,000
Oh god

2623
03:08:59,000 --> 03:09:03,000
They've already moved over here. Yeah, this is toast this is toast

2624
03:09:05,000 --> 03:09:07,000
Unless I can come up with like a miracle jump here

2625
03:09:09,000 --> 03:09:13,000
That that is what I would consider a miracle jump that was a that was a miracle jump

2626
03:09:13,000 --> 03:09:15,000
Yeah

2627
03:09:23,000 --> 03:09:25,000
Miracles have seriously been witness

2628
03:09:29,000 --> 03:09:34,000
Like I'm glad everyone like said they appraise this evening because that was okay

2629
03:09:37,000 --> 03:09:39,000
No, he's up here again

2630
03:09:40,000 --> 03:09:44,000
You can even throw that far he can't fuck yourself

2631
03:09:46,000 --> 03:09:48,000
You can do that though

2632
03:09:51,000 --> 03:09:57,000
We're gonna go slow again because that that's the lie. I want to try to get two hits here

2633
03:09:59,000 --> 03:10:01,000
There's another big fat fish

2634
03:10:04,000 --> 03:10:06,000
All right, let's do it

2635
03:10:10,000 --> 03:10:15,000
Damn it. I don't know I got a I got away till he's at the peak of his jump

2636
03:10:20,000 --> 03:10:28,000
Oh my god, there's a wall there's a wall you put a fucking wall you put a fucking wall you put a wall this guy put a fucking wall up

2637
03:10:29,000 --> 03:10:35,000
I I just threw my app as on the ground. I don't even I put a wall up this wall there. That was the end

2638
03:10:35,000 --> 03:10:39,000
I beat it. I beat it. I beat the level. I beat the level. I beat it

2639
03:10:39,000 --> 03:10:43,000
I I beat it. That was it. I won I won

2640
03:10:45,000 --> 03:10:50,000
Trying to run by Bowser everybody knows that fucking Bowser Bowser is like you can do that but

2641
03:10:51,000 --> 03:10:53,000
Everybody knows that that's what happens

2642
03:10:53,000 --> 03:10:56,000
You run right by by you touch the thing. That's what every single one of these levels has been

2643
03:11:00,000 --> 03:11:04,000
Every single one of these levels has dude puts a wall up

2644
03:11:05,000 --> 03:11:13,000
Dude puts a wall up right there just just in case you you know you have trouble with this level and you're trying to like get

2645
03:11:13,000 --> 03:11:19,000
You do the big jump and you manipulate yeah put put put a giant red wall so I have to like jump way over it

2646
03:11:19,000 --> 03:11:23,000
I don't even know I can't even normally jump over that wall can I I think I have to go over the top

2647
03:11:25,000 --> 03:11:27,000
Last level

2648
03:11:27,000 --> 03:11:29,000
last life

2649
03:11:30,000 --> 03:11:36,000
And I'm just I'm just just drained of all my ability to even pretend to play this game. I just want to make the end level

2650
03:11:37,000 --> 03:11:41,000
I just want to relax and make fucking Mario level. Where's the camera camera? Where are you?

2651
03:11:43,000 --> 03:11:45,000
Stuff the camera up your ass

2652
03:11:50,000 --> 03:11:52,000
Dude puts a wall

2653
03:11:53,000 --> 03:11:55,000
Wall up and now there's a

2654
03:11:56,000 --> 03:11:57,000
Oh

2655
03:11:57,000 --> 03:12:00,000
That's correct care to take they couldn't get it

2656
03:12:00,000 --> 03:12:03,000
I couldn't fucking dude puts fucking wall up

2657
03:12:04,000 --> 03:12:06,000
It's a big red wall behind

2658
03:12:07,000 --> 03:12:09,000
No, it's just this this that

2659
03:12:10,000 --> 03:12:14,000

2662
03:12:25,000 --> 03:12:27,000

03:12:36,000 --> 03:12:40,000

2666
03:13:11,000 --> 03:13:15,000
Zero this had that me now I'm the seventh person to play this

2667
03:13:21,000 --> 03:13:23,000
I don't I say something

2668
03:13:26,000 --> 03:13:29,000
It's your way to write I'm just gonna drop a dumb shit

2669
03:13:35,000 --> 03:13:37,000
Let me download that one

2670
03:13:38,000 --> 03:13:43,000
What does that thing over there 1534 I gave it and I gave it an attempt I gave it my best effort

2671
03:13:45,000 --> 03:13:47,000
So wait nobody has beaten this is that what that means?

2672
03:13:51,000 --> 03:13:53,000
You tell me I could have been like the first person to clear that

2673
03:13:56,000 --> 03:13:58,000
That would have been so oh man

2674
03:14:00,000 --> 03:14:05,000
That would have been cool if I was like the first dude to clear that I'm so depressed

2675
03:14:07,000 --> 03:14:11,000
I'm just depressed right now like I I I cheated you saw saw me win

2676
03:14:12,000 --> 03:14:14,000
The axe was right there I touched the axe I

2677
03:14:15,000 --> 03:14:17,000
Beat I beat that level okay

2678
03:14:18,000 --> 03:14:23,000
I mean it'd be one thing if I kept dying it like the first part, but I yeah, I got to the end right

2679
03:14:26,000 --> 03:14:28,000
I

2680
03:14:29,000 --> 03:14:31,000
Man

2681
03:14:31,000 --> 03:14:33,000
I hope it was entertaining

2682
03:14:34,000 --> 03:14:41,000
That's all I care about and writing a bunch of fucking swears on this guy's thing, but I don't know how to do that

2683
03:14:42,000 --> 03:14:44,000
Okay, like banned from Nintendo

2684
03:14:45,000 --> 03:14:53,000
I was gonna like draw like a picture of you like fuck you you a level fucking sucks and then I'm gonna get like a parma ban from Nintendo

2685
03:14:56,000 --> 03:14:58,000
Now let's go to the main menu. Let's be honest. I'm just gonna chill

2686
03:14:59,000 --> 03:15:03,000
Just relax. Let's make it. Let's make it course. I'm just gonna go relax

2687
03:15:05,000 --> 03:15:11,000
No, there's no reason to to freak out about stuff like that. Let's you look at the mile level. Let's go over my level one more time

2688
03:15:12,000 --> 03:15:16,000
He's right here. You start you fall down. Whoa. You're gonna make it or not?

2689
03:15:16,000 --> 03:15:18,000
Maybe you will

2690
03:15:18,000 --> 03:15:22,000
But look at this. This is just good old-fashioned Mario fun where there's mushroom city

2691
03:15:23,000 --> 03:15:25,000
You see this is fun

2692
03:15:26,000 --> 03:15:29,000
That's expand on this I'm gonna start a new one

2693
03:15:33,000 --> 03:15:36,000
Remember the time German was the first one to beat this level it was awesome

2694
03:15:42,000 --> 03:15:44,000
No

2695
03:15:45,000 --> 03:15:47,000
God you know, we just you just have no fulfillment I

2696
03:15:49,000 --> 03:15:52,000
Just I'm just I'm just for film endless right now

2697
03:15:53,000 --> 03:15:56,000
My little dog you know

2698
03:15:59,000 --> 03:16:01,000
Auto will make me feel better

2699
03:16:05,000 --> 03:16:12,000
So let's I threw my stylus somewhere in that in the mayhem of me complaining about that level

2700
03:16:23,000 --> 03:16:25,000
I'm really

2701
03:16:31,000 --> 03:16:35,000
Haven't even eaten I've she's in crackers over here. I haven't even like eaten one of them

2702
03:16:37,000 --> 03:16:39,000
As long as it beat that Mario level

2703
03:16:41,000 --> 03:16:43,000
We're gonna shake this up. We're gonna make a weird level

2704
03:16:45,000 --> 03:16:47,000
So

2705
03:16:47,000 --> 03:16:52,000
I can find the stylus is this gonna get me bangry to where's this title is where's the

2706
03:16:52,000 --> 03:16:55,000
God have stylus you're gonna lose the stylus where's the damn stylus?

2707
03:16:56,000 --> 03:16:58,000
But really though where's it? Oh?

2708
03:16:59,000 --> 03:17:01,000
It's in my crotch

2709
03:17:01,000 --> 03:17:04,000
It was in the fly of my zipper here

2710
03:17:06,000 --> 03:17:09,000
Found it all right, let me put my feet up

2711
03:17:10,000 --> 03:17:12,000
Put my chair back a little bit in this

2712
03:17:13,000 --> 03:17:17,000
Let's just hang out just you me Mario maker

2713
03:17:18,000 --> 03:17:22,000
See Mario right there gonna be making a couple of things you're gonna be making a

2714
03:17:22,000 --> 03:17:24,000
Doing an underground level tonight

2715
03:17:26,000 --> 03:17:31,000
Gonna put some of these put some walls up here this is gonna be a very linear level

2716
03:17:34,000 --> 03:17:36,000
Wait, is that really my hand?

2717
03:17:36,000 --> 03:17:38,000
Look at that's my hand I

2718
03:17:40,000 --> 03:17:43,000
Didn't even see that before I was like my I was so locked in I

2719
03:17:44,000 --> 03:17:46,000
Really thought that was my hand

2720
03:17:52,000 --> 03:17:54,000
I

2721
03:17:55,000 --> 03:17:57,000
Fucking for real thought that was it looks like my hand

2722
03:17:58,000 --> 03:18:02,000
That looks like my fucking head. I swear to God. That's my head on the screen

2723
03:18:03,000 --> 03:18:07,000
God what kind of like drugs am I on right now? All right, let's reset

2724
03:18:18,000 --> 03:18:20,000
The one that I think about is like why

2725
03:18:21,000 --> 03:18:24,000
There's no camera pointing down from the ceiling

2726
03:18:31,000 --> 03:18:34,000
Okay, she gets yourself together she

2727
03:18:39,000 --> 03:18:42,000
Looks like my fucking hand that's my hand

2728
03:18:47,000 --> 03:18:49,000
All right, we're gonna make this put this here

2729
03:18:50,000 --> 03:18:57,000
Why is it at what is it on the screen why Nintendo of all things why is there a hand a human hand

2730
03:19:05,000 --> 03:19:09,000
You guys have no idea how much I freak the fuck out I'm because you're my peripheral vision

2731
03:19:10,000 --> 03:19:12,000
Saw that on my big screen up here

2732
03:19:13,000 --> 03:19:15,000
Geez

2733
03:19:15,000 --> 03:19:16,000
It's spooky

2734
03:19:16,000 --> 03:19:21,000
All right, I want this to be I want first of all I want you want to be one people to troll about this, you know

2735
03:19:25,000 --> 03:19:29,000
Delete some of that I'm stropped my iPad

2736
03:19:32,000 --> 03:19:34,000
I got new stuff where's my new stuff

2737
03:19:39,000 --> 03:19:43,000
Do have new stuff look at all this shit that I don't have

2738
03:19:47,000 --> 03:19:49,000
Clean that up

2739
03:19:53,000 --> 03:19:55,000
Okay, so we're gonna keep that going

2740
03:19:57,000 --> 03:20:01,000
We'll do one one two one two one two

2741
03:20:09,000 --> 03:20:11,000
Yeah, oh

2742
03:20:11,000 --> 03:20:13,000
Set it just give it a wide set

2743
03:20:16,000 --> 03:20:19,000
So they're gonna start the level off and have to run for a little bit

2744
03:20:21,000 --> 03:20:25,000
We'll put we'll make all things a little bit dangerous, you know make a little bit dangerous

2745
03:20:26,000 --> 03:20:31,000
If you want if you want to try to get that you're all you know, you're all you can get it if you want

2746
03:20:32,000 --> 03:20:34,000
Although I think I'm pretty sure that's impossible

2747
03:20:35,000 --> 03:20:37,000
That's not possible to get this right

2748
03:20:38,000 --> 03:20:40,000
No, it is it is it's very possible

2749
03:20:40,000 --> 03:20:47,000
Well you can change the hand model in the settings you kidding let's take a look I need to see that

2750
03:20:50,000 --> 03:20:55,000
Gamepad 3D audio and out of case course comments controls where is it?

2751
03:20:56,000 --> 03:20:58,000
That'll see it

2752
03:21:03,000 --> 03:21:05,000
Whatever

2753
03:21:05,000 --> 03:21:09,000
All right, so that is gettable. Let's do it. We'll put a put a mushroom in there

2754
03:21:09,000 --> 03:21:16,000
It's gonna be real dangerous, but if you're able to get there then you know good for you

2755
03:21:20,000 --> 03:21:22,000
Press stick

2756
03:21:25,000 --> 03:21:27,000
I don't fucking even know what's happening in my life

2757
03:21:27,000 --> 03:21:34,000
What do I want next?

2758
03:21:36,000 --> 03:21:38,000
Maybe I should put something to jump over

2759
03:21:39,000 --> 03:21:41,000
Yeah, you can have to do some jumping here

2760
03:21:46,000 --> 03:21:48,000
That

2761
03:21:48,000 --> 03:21:52,000
Maybe another like that can you get over that is that possible to go over that I

2762
03:21:53,000 --> 03:21:55,000
Like I you can just test it immediately that's awesome

2763
03:21:58,000 --> 03:22:01,000
Oh, you mean like the thumb sticks okay, I getcha

2764
03:22:07,000 --> 03:22:10,000
Yeah, I'm dumb chump I'm immersed in my video game

2765
03:22:12,000 --> 03:22:14,000
Yeah, that's that's that's real games

2766
03:22:16,000 --> 03:22:18,000
Good

2767
03:22:18,000 --> 03:22:22,000
I wonder if you can even get over this can I even beat my own level probably not

2768
03:22:24,000 --> 03:22:27,000
Yeah, you can get over that very nice

2769
03:22:28,000 --> 03:22:31,000
Like the gamepad stick

2770
03:22:33,000 --> 03:22:35,000
Hey, look at that. Oh what?

2771
03:22:38,000 --> 03:22:40,000
You can have like a Mickey Mouse hand

2772
03:22:53,000 --> 03:22:55,000
Cat ball

2773
03:22:58,000 --> 03:23:00,000
Only Nintendo would do something like that

2774
03:23:06,000 --> 03:23:08,000
Dada Dada Dada

2775
03:23:08,000 --> 03:23:10,000
All right, let me go back to this

2776
03:23:16,000 --> 03:23:19,000
Okay, we're gonna put a secret right at the don't tell anybody

2777
03:23:20,000 --> 03:23:25,000
But right at the beginning of the level you can go up here

2778
03:23:26,000 --> 03:23:29,000
And there's gonna be a bunch of secret shit up here

2779
03:23:31,000 --> 03:23:33,000
No, you can win the game if you come up here

2780
03:23:35,000 --> 03:23:37,000
Yeah, like here already

2781
03:23:42,000 --> 03:23:44,000
This is gonna be a straight line to the pull

2782
03:23:46,000 --> 03:23:48,000
That you'll never know unless you were watching this stream

2783
03:23:55,000 --> 03:23:59,000
Yeah, that's Mario's hand

2784
03:24:04,000 --> 03:24:06,000
That was him that was trouble right now

2785
03:24:08,000 --> 03:24:11,000
So see it's a guaranteed one there you go guaranteed one

2786
03:24:21,000 --> 03:24:23,000
Give it a that

2787
03:24:26,000 --> 03:24:28,000
You

2788
03:24:31,000 --> 03:24:33,000
I'm gonna put this higher

2789
03:24:37,000 --> 03:24:39,000
Put it here

2790
03:24:44,000 --> 03:24:50,000
Is that like just out of reach let's find out let's find out

2791
03:24:50,000 --> 03:25:00,000
It's just real that which that's so obvious that's so obvious we're scrapping that that's like the easiest thing I've ever seen

2792
03:25:00,000 --> 03:25:02,000
It's so obvious

2793
03:25:03,000 --> 03:25:06,000
Look keep it there's been out of them just because it decided to go against it

2794
03:25:08,000 --> 03:25:11,000
Okay, let's put

2795
03:25:11,000 --> 03:25:13,000
I'm gonna have some coins

2796
03:25:18,000 --> 03:25:20,000
Three two three

2797
03:25:25,000 --> 03:25:27,000
What is the little shit I do again?

2798
03:25:37,000 --> 03:25:39,000
How bad how hard is this jump

2799
03:25:42,000 --> 03:25:44,000
Hey you slip around a little bit

2800
03:25:58,000 --> 03:26:04,000
No hidden blocks no hidden blocks I want you to think they're hidden blocks

2801
03:26:05,000 --> 03:26:07,000
Okay

2802
03:26:07,000 --> 03:26:09,000
Danger mushroom right there

2803
03:26:11,000 --> 03:26:13,000
Dangerous wait under

2804
03:26:22,000 --> 03:26:29,000
Okay, now I need to have like somewhat of a normal little bit here

2805
03:26:30,000 --> 03:26:35,000
Maybe one one maybe one more like jump. It's really annoying to do

2806
03:26:37,000 --> 03:26:39,000
And then we take this

2807
03:26:48,000 --> 03:26:50,000
Up with it

2808
03:26:59,000 --> 03:27:03,000
I'm gonna do the thing where it's levels over but gotcha levels not over

2809
03:27:04,000 --> 03:27:06,000
You know what I mean?

2810
03:27:06,000 --> 03:27:08,000
It's gonna be a such a gotcha moment

2811
03:27:25,000 --> 03:27:29,000
Replace these with this to make it so much more obvious that it's the end of the level

2812
03:27:34,000 --> 03:27:36,000
I

2813
03:27:36,000 --> 03:27:38,000
Fix that mistake

2814
03:27:47,000 --> 03:27:49,000
Just like that

2815
03:27:49,000 --> 03:27:54,000
Oh, what a doozy what a doozy you see this doozy

2816
03:27:57,000 --> 03:27:59,000
Okay, this one

2817
03:28:00,000 --> 03:28:02,000
You can't beat my level

2818
03:28:04,000 --> 03:28:07,000
This is the end just kidding you got to break this oh

2819
03:28:08,000 --> 03:28:12,000
Wow what what I you want to talk about a crazy twist

2820
03:28:15,000 --> 03:28:19,000
This is the twist right here guys gotta get that mushroom back here

2821
03:28:21,000 --> 03:28:23,000
We think you're gonna be able to get that mushroom

2822
03:28:24,000 --> 03:28:26,000
Otherwise you're a toast you gotta do it again

2823
03:28:34,000 --> 03:28:36,000
You

2824
03:28:38,000 --> 03:28:42,000
Pretty pretty hard those pretty difficult let's try it again

2825
03:28:45,000 --> 03:28:49,000
It's not quite there yet, but see I know the secret to that one because I made it you know

2826
03:28:49,000 --> 03:28:55,000
I'm the creator of this level so I know you know all the all the secrets and nuances and how everything works

2827
03:28:58,000 --> 03:29:01,000
So you get to hear oh yeah, oh yeah, oh don't worry you're good

2828
03:29:02,000 --> 03:29:04,000
Next part of the level

2829
03:29:07,000 --> 03:29:10,000
You just to be a real prick about things

2830
03:29:13,000 --> 03:29:19,000
Just to make sure you don't you don't have chance

2831
03:29:23,000 --> 03:29:25,000
I wish I had more stuff

2832
03:29:29,000 --> 03:29:31,000
Okay

2833
03:29:31,000 --> 03:29:33,000
Put a couple of these here

2834
03:29:37,000 --> 03:29:39,000
Yeah, why not

2835
03:29:41,000 --> 03:29:43,000
This is where it gets dangerous

2836
03:29:45,000 --> 03:29:50,000
No, that's not the end a little bit more not that much but

2837
03:29:53,000 --> 03:29:55,000
Well, he sure got me

2838
03:29:56,000 --> 03:29:58,000
Didn't I

2839
03:30:01,000 --> 03:30:06,000
So now we're gonna put someone here

2840
03:30:08,000 --> 03:30:10,000
Now can you mess with the timers on these things

2841
03:30:13,000 --> 03:30:15,000
Like can I determine when this is gonna pop up

2842
03:30:16,000 --> 03:30:18,000
What the fuck just happened

2843
03:30:20,000 --> 03:30:22,000
What's going on

2844
03:30:24,000 --> 03:30:27,000
My battery died on my Wii U gamepad

2845
03:30:27,000 --> 03:30:29,000
I

2846
03:30:29,000 --> 03:30:32,000
Can't say I don't know what's happening hold on let me plug it in

2847
03:30:36,000 --> 03:30:38,000
Hold on

2848
03:30:44,000 --> 03:30:46,000
This thing died

2849
03:30:46,000 --> 03:30:49,000
I wonder why I died I'm maybe because I played like an hour and ten minutes on the same level

2850
03:30:50,000 --> 03:30:52,000
I

2851
03:30:55,000 --> 03:30:57,000
Um

2852
03:30:58,000 --> 03:31:00,000
Can I do it with the Wii

2853
03:31:01,000 --> 03:31:03,000
It's like if I can just do it like this I don't care I'll do it

2854
03:31:04,000 --> 03:31:09,000
Nope, I cannot I can move him around but I can't actually use the Wii

2855
03:31:09,000 --> 03:31:11,000
I

2856
03:31:17,000 --> 03:31:19,000
Let me just plug it in one second guys

2857
03:31:40,000 --> 03:31:42,000
Oh

2858
03:31:56,000 --> 03:31:59,000
Wii U gamepad I'm not a battery life

2859
03:32:04,000 --> 03:32:06,000
Oh

2860
03:32:10,000 --> 03:32:12,000
I have an open outlet I can put this in

2861
03:32:14,000 --> 03:32:16,000
Also

2862
03:32:16,000 --> 03:32:18,000
Otherwise

2863
03:32:19,000 --> 03:32:24,000
I might have to just play more levels because that's how I can really do if I don't have the gamepad

2864
03:32:30,000 --> 03:32:32,000
What a great stream that's going on right now

2865
03:32:34,000 --> 03:32:38,000
You got a guy that's you know doesn't even charge his batteries on his Wii U gamepad

2866
03:32:39,000 --> 03:32:42,000
I'd like to punch that guy in his face

2867
03:32:46,000 --> 03:32:48,000
All right, we got we got some juice

2868
03:32:50,000 --> 03:32:52,000
And I turn it back on

2869
03:32:57,000 --> 03:32:59,000
Uh, go go ahead let's do it

2870
03:33:02,000 --> 03:33:04,000
Hey, we have life

2871
03:33:06,000 --> 03:33:08,000
Look at that now I can move

2872
03:33:10,000 --> 03:33:14,000
Okay, so I wanted to I was my question was can you determine the timers

2873
03:33:15,000 --> 03:33:17,000
On these guys

2874
03:33:23,000 --> 03:33:25,000
Notification setting manual

2875
03:33:27,000 --> 03:33:28,000
Maybe not

2876
03:33:28,000 --> 03:33:30,000
Can you

2877
03:33:30,000 --> 03:33:32,000
Let me get my second iPad to see what people are saying

2878
03:33:40,000 --> 03:33:42,000
Stick a fork in an outlet please

2879
03:33:52,000 --> 03:33:54,000
All right, let's do it

2880
03:33:57,000 --> 03:34:00,000
Couple more of those I want them to be random

2881
03:34:04,000 --> 03:34:06,000
And put way too much orange juice on this gamepad

2882
03:34:07,000 --> 03:34:11,000
Yeah, I probably shouldn't have tried to pour orange juice on my gamepad. They probably would help

2883
03:34:21,000 --> 03:34:24,000
I even wings this one just be sitting there

2884
03:34:24,000 --> 03:34:26,000
Oh

2885
03:34:33,000 --> 03:34:36,000
This one move this one down so you think you're safe

2886
03:34:44,000 --> 03:34:46,000
Too much

2887
03:34:48,000 --> 03:34:51,000
Oh, it could do is you know what you're just safe

2888
03:34:51,000 --> 03:34:58,000
No, no, no, no, hold on hold on a second hold on just one second here man

2889
03:35:00,000 --> 03:35:02,000
You think you think you died when you fell

2890
03:35:03,000 --> 03:35:05,000
Nope

2891
03:35:05,000 --> 03:35:07,000
We give people second chances here

2892
03:35:13,000 --> 03:35:15,000
That comes up like this

2893
03:35:15,000 --> 03:35:19,000
But because you got a second chance you're gonna do a dollar shit

2894
03:35:21,000 --> 03:35:25,000
You do get a second chance, but you bet you better make account

2895
03:35:32,000 --> 03:35:35,000
How noticeable is that is that really noticeable

2896
03:35:40,000 --> 03:35:42,000
Let's go

2897
03:35:43,000 --> 03:35:47,000
I'm not gonna move this all right, let's do it. Let's see what happens here

2898
03:35:49,000 --> 03:35:51,000
So they are random

2899
03:35:51,000 --> 03:35:53,000
Kind of right where did this one go

2900
03:36:00,000 --> 03:36:02,000
No, you can see them

2901
03:36:05,000 --> 03:36:08,000
I gotta take I gotta take away the wings

2902
03:36:09,000 --> 03:36:11,000
Oh

2903
03:36:20,000 --> 03:36:23,000
You buddy have wings this boom is got wings

2904
03:36:31,000 --> 03:36:33,000
Okay, they shouldn't be able to see

2905
03:36:33,000 --> 03:36:35,000
Oh

2906
03:36:36,000 --> 03:36:38,000
Wow real exciting stuff

2907
03:36:41,000 --> 03:36:43,000
Can you still see them

2908
03:36:47,000 --> 03:36:49,000
Oh, those up a little

2909
03:36:57,000 --> 03:36:59,000
All right

2910
03:37:00,000 --> 03:37:02,000
Oh

2911
03:37:02,000 --> 03:37:04,000
This is gonna lead up to here

2912
03:37:07,000 --> 03:37:09,000
There are a bunch of coins

2913
03:37:10,000 --> 03:37:13,000
And if you made it this far congratulations here are some coins

2914
03:37:20,000 --> 03:37:22,000
You

2915
03:37:23,000 --> 03:37:25,000
When

2916
03:37:26,000 --> 03:37:30,000
And then if you can see up here there's gonna be

2917
03:37:32,000 --> 03:37:34,000
Smiley

2918
03:37:34,000 --> 03:37:38,000
Let's try it. Let's just take a look take a gander at it

2919
03:37:47,000 --> 03:37:49,000
All right play

2920
03:37:56,000 --> 03:37:58,000
It's kind of no reason for the mushroom

2921
03:38:05,000 --> 03:38:08,000
Well, well the oh boy, oh, I can't do it now. I can't beat the level

2922
03:38:10,000 --> 03:38:12,000
That's when you go what the hell

2923
03:38:13,000 --> 03:38:15,000
What a dick

2924
03:38:25,000 --> 03:38:27,000
Whoops

2925
03:38:28,000 --> 03:38:30,000
Whoops

2926
03:38:34,000 --> 03:38:36,000
Knicks ago

2927
03:38:43,000 --> 03:38:47,000
The reason for the coins either at this point and you can just walk over that I just realized

2928
03:38:52,000 --> 03:38:54,000
Made it through phase one

2929
03:38:56,000 --> 03:38:58,000
Oh phase two oh no

2930
03:39:01,000 --> 03:39:04,000
I made it to the end I win

2931
03:39:04,000 --> 03:39:06,000
Holy shit, that was kind of a hard jump

2932
03:39:13,000 --> 03:39:17,000
Now let's make the mushroom impossible to get it to be real mean let's be real mean about it

2933
03:39:23,000 --> 03:39:25,000
Maybe she's just be right there

2934
03:39:25,000 --> 03:39:27,000
You

2935
03:39:30,000 --> 03:39:33,000
What does go what does the sound effects right where's going on the background there

2936
03:39:39,000 --> 03:39:43,000
I make that so it's harder to get

2937
03:39:56,000 --> 03:39:59,000
You got that maybe maybe

2938
03:40:09,000 --> 03:40:12,000
Yeah, that's that's a little bit that's a little harder

2939
03:40:18,000 --> 03:40:20,000
I wasn't that mushroom

2940
03:40:20,000 --> 03:40:22,000
It was a really weird mushroom

2941
03:40:25,000 --> 03:40:27,000
No, I'll get I'll get rid of this too

2942
03:40:29,000 --> 03:40:31,000
So you're gonna get that mid jump

2943
03:40:38,000 --> 03:40:41,000
Oh yeah, yeah, whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa easy easy hold on a second

2944
03:40:42,000 --> 03:40:47,000
Wait just a second here get rid of all this you gotta go mid jump you're gonna make the whole thing you're gonna make the jump

2945
03:40:48,000 --> 03:40:50,000
Where do you end up

2946
03:40:50,000 --> 03:40:52,000
Oh

2947
03:40:55,000 --> 03:40:57,000
Right there

2948
03:40:57,000 --> 03:40:59,000
Actually, it's even further jump

2949
03:41:01,000 --> 03:41:03,000
Now it comes out too fast

2950
03:41:08,000 --> 03:41:10,000
Bang okay

2951
03:41:11,000 --> 03:41:13,000
Right there

2952
03:41:13,000 --> 03:41:15,000
Oh

2953
03:41:19,000 --> 03:41:21,000
Carried away

2954
03:41:22,000 --> 03:41:25,000
Oh, that's cool that's cool

2955
03:41:34,000 --> 03:41:36,000
Now fucking fell off

2956
03:41:37,000 --> 03:41:39,000
Is there a way how do I wish I was a

2957
03:41:40,000 --> 03:41:43,000
There's no way to mess with this guy's behavior, huh

2958
03:41:45,000 --> 03:41:47,000
I guess I could just do this

2959
03:41:49,000 --> 03:41:51,000
Right that's easy enough

2960
03:42:04,000 --> 03:42:06,000
Let's try that

2961
03:42:06,000 --> 03:42:08,000
Is he gonna jump

2962
03:42:10,000 --> 03:42:16,000
So you yeah you this you miss that mushroom you gotta start over again maybe I'll do like

2963
03:42:20,000 --> 03:42:24,000
Okay, I'll be a little too much maybe

2964
03:42:30,000 --> 03:42:32,000
And you can use that to jump up here

2965
03:42:34,000 --> 03:42:36,000
All right

2966
03:42:40,000 --> 03:42:42,000
Oh

2967
03:42:44,000 --> 03:42:46,000
Make the green shell

2968
03:42:46,000 --> 03:42:48,000
Make a red shell is Cooper

2969
03:42:54,000 --> 03:42:57,000
Shake the Cooper to make him turn right usually coins do

2970
03:43:01,000 --> 03:43:03,000
Yes

2971
03:43:10,000 --> 03:43:12,000
Oh

2972
03:43:14,000 --> 03:43:17,000
Yeah, you don't have to do that you're right you're right chatter

2973
03:43:18,000 --> 03:43:20,000
I don't know if I do this

2974
03:43:26,000 --> 03:43:28,000
It's still possible

2975
03:43:29,000 --> 03:43:31,000
It's definitely still possible

2976
03:43:34,000 --> 03:43:36,000
Okay, but even higher no

2977
03:43:40,000 --> 03:43:42,000
That might be too high to even hit now

2978
03:43:45,000 --> 03:43:48,000
There we are now you have to do that

2979
03:43:58,000 --> 03:44:00,000
Got a time it right

2980
03:44:03,000 --> 03:44:07,000
Oh, I see I can't even time it this is I like it. I like that. I wish I could put more things in here

2981
03:44:07,000 --> 03:44:11,000
I would put this all around being able to do like jumps like that

2982
03:44:18,000 --> 03:44:20,000
Oh

2983
03:44:21,000 --> 03:44:25,000
All right, so we can get rid of this then he reds walk walk up the edge. Okay

2984
03:44:26,000 --> 03:44:28,000
Sounds like

2985
03:44:30,000 --> 03:44:32,000
I put a couple over then

2986
03:44:32,000 --> 03:44:34,000
I put let's put like

2987
03:44:37,000 --> 03:44:39,000
Do to do now one we'll do one with

2988
03:44:48,000 --> 03:44:50,000
Moving backwards too much

2989
03:44:55,000 --> 03:44:57,000
Not enough momentum I like this

2990
03:44:59,000 --> 03:45:01,000
All right, this is this works

2991
03:45:02,000 --> 03:45:04,000
You

2992
03:45:04,000 --> 03:45:06,000
Yeah, see and I you get screwed up with those guys

2993
03:45:08,000 --> 03:45:13,000
You can save right because I want to like actually get items

2994
03:45:13,000 --> 03:45:15,000
and use them

2995
03:45:16,000 --> 03:45:18,000
Like a saw blade come across like here

2996
03:45:20,000 --> 03:45:22,000
I've just like bullet bills shooting this direction

2997
03:45:29,000 --> 03:45:31,000
No, that's good enough

2998
03:45:32,000 --> 03:45:34,000
Oh

2999
03:45:40,000 --> 03:45:42,000
I got to the end I can't get out of here

3000
03:45:45,000 --> 03:45:50,000
Can you get the mushroom go back and just do the jump the second time? I don't think so

3001
03:45:54,000 --> 03:45:57,000
Mean a baby you can but it's kind of hard

3002
03:46:02,000 --> 03:46:05,000
I'm trying to replicate what you're asking see

3003
03:46:07,000 --> 03:46:09,000
Yeah, I guess you can

3004
03:46:11,000 --> 03:46:13,000
Is it time to remove this

3005
03:46:14,000 --> 03:46:16,000
Is that still is that doable

3006
03:46:19,000 --> 03:46:21,000
Kind

3007
03:46:21,000 --> 03:46:23,000
Oh

3008
03:46:29,000 --> 03:46:31,000
The hell this mushroom is a thing

3009
03:46:34,000 --> 03:46:37,000
Can throw the mushroom out of it shaking this doesn't do much

3010
03:46:40,000 --> 03:46:42,000
Why is that I can't turn it into one up

3011
03:46:52,000 --> 03:46:54,000
Is it I don't even know this is still possible

3012
03:46:57,000 --> 03:47:02,000
I don't know now that it's there I might have to move it a little forward a little bit like over to try to a couple more times

3013
03:47:08,000 --> 03:47:10,000
Yeah, I'm gonna have to move it

3014
03:47:11,000 --> 03:47:13,000
Not to move it one more block this way

3015
03:47:14,000 --> 03:47:16,000
No, that's a that's a month

3016
03:47:16,000 --> 03:47:18,000
You

3017
03:47:21,000 --> 03:47:24,000
Put a brick over the first two open bricks so you can only run and build a momentum

3018
03:47:25,000 --> 03:47:27,000
It's not a bad idea

3019
03:47:31,000 --> 03:47:33,000
Oops

3020
03:47:39,000 --> 03:47:41,000
Ah, yeah, you've just barely make it

3021
03:47:43,000 --> 03:47:45,000
All right now I have to test to make sure you can't go backwards

3022
03:47:47,000 --> 03:47:49,000
Like can you get this and still come back

3023
03:47:50,000 --> 03:47:52,000
No, not really

3024
03:48:01,000 --> 03:48:03,000
You say I like put one here

3025
03:48:06,000 --> 03:48:08,000
See you have to let's try it

3026
03:48:10,000 --> 03:48:13,000
I could spend all day doing this if I had like more of the things

3027
03:48:17,000 --> 03:48:20,000
You can turn Mario into a Luigi

3028
03:48:22,000 --> 03:48:24,000
Oh, you make them bigger small

3029
03:48:35,000 --> 03:48:38,000
I just wish I could put more of these things you can't I can't really do much

3030
03:48:38,000 --> 03:48:40,000
So

3031
03:48:45,000 --> 03:48:50,000
So I have to move my like we clock forward is that what I have to do

3032
03:48:55,000 --> 03:48:57,000
Apparently

3033
03:48:59,000 --> 03:49:02,000
Well, maybe for next time I just wanted to mess around a little bit

3034
03:49:03,000 --> 03:49:05,000
I

3035
03:49:05,000 --> 03:49:09,000
I'd like to put much more hazards and much more things here, but there's not very much to start off with

3036
03:49:11,000 --> 03:49:13,000
I'll save this though. Save an exit

3037
03:49:18,000 --> 03:49:20,000
You're way to save

3038
03:49:22,000 --> 03:49:24,000
See see see

3039
03:49:26,000 --> 03:49:28,000
Who saved

3040
03:49:28,000 --> 03:49:33,000
If you frustrate your players in the first jump your levels not going to rate well

3041
03:49:36,000 --> 03:49:38,000
Well, I'll tweak it

3042
03:49:41,000 --> 03:49:43,000
To eat this tweaked this is some other day

3043
03:49:58,000 --> 03:50:00,000
Like much of junk blocks

3044
03:50:07,000 --> 03:50:10,000
What is this thing you can do as you random property

3045
03:50:11,000 --> 03:50:13,000
Random mushroom

3046
03:50:15,000 --> 03:50:17,000
Whatever

3047
03:50:20,000 --> 03:50:24,000
You unlock more by beating other people's levels I beat a bunch earlier

3048
03:50:24,000 --> 03:50:28,000
I only got like one unlock. Oh, you know, I'll go do some more of that

3049
03:50:30,000 --> 03:50:32,000
Until I can get some more stuff unlocked. It's pretty limited

3050
03:50:34,000 --> 03:50:36,000
It's about no

3051
03:50:37,000 --> 03:50:43,000
I'll play in a little string of the levels and then I'm gonna go to bed

3052
03:50:48,000 --> 03:50:51,000
Yeah, this I wouldn't publish this one no way

3053
03:50:51,000 --> 03:50:53,000
I don't want to get something interesting done with it

3054
03:50:54,000 --> 03:50:58,000
I'd want to have stuff like that happen and you have to do that multiple times

3055
03:51:00,000 --> 03:51:04,000
But not so terrible that you know, you end up like I was yelling at things

3056
03:51:05,000 --> 03:51:08,000
To be fair though that level of that guy made was was pretty damn good

3057
03:51:15,000 --> 03:51:17,000
All right 10 Mario Characters

3058
03:51:17,000 --> 03:51:20,000
Can I do this one on normal or expert or something

3059
03:51:21,000 --> 03:51:23,000
You know

3060
03:51:25,000 --> 03:51:27,000
No

3061
03:51:27,000 --> 03:51:30,000
Let's go back you know that I've had some time to like warm up a little bit

3062
03:51:33,000 --> 03:51:35,000
I want to go

3063
03:51:37,000 --> 03:51:43,000
Of course is we'll try one of like the good featured ones because like I was all over the place earlier this uh this evening

3064
03:51:46,000 --> 03:51:49,000
Mr. Chomp's dog cause that was give that gave me a hot left look at this

3065
03:51:51,000 --> 03:51:54,000
So that there's only a twat party toward that 20

3066
03:51:55,000 --> 03:51:58,000
2.37 percent clear right

3067
03:51:59,000 --> 03:52:03,000
So no, maybe I wasn't crazy. This is just extremely difficult

3068
03:52:05,000 --> 03:52:09,000
Only 15 people have beaten it at a 632 attempts or 632 people

3069
03:52:11,000 --> 03:52:13,000
That's kind of crazy

3070
03:52:18,000 --> 03:52:20,000
Oh, let's go back

3071
03:52:21,000 --> 03:52:24,000
Let's let's wait where's one with like a like a 20 percent or 10 percent or something

3072
03:52:27,000 --> 03:52:33,000
All right one shell this is a 1 percent clear ratio damn by star ranking

3073
03:52:36,000 --> 03:52:39,000
Don't press anything I played that one before. Didn't I?

3074
03:52:40,000 --> 03:52:42,000
Look at how many ratings this has

3075
03:52:42,000 --> 03:52:44,000
Don't press anything too

3076
03:52:45,000 --> 03:52:47,000
Press right run and enjoy

3077
03:52:47,000 --> 03:52:49,000
You

3078
03:52:49,000 --> 03:52:51,000
Let's do that one

3079
03:52:52,000 --> 03:52:55,000
53 you can apparently still not beat this one

3080
03:52:59,000 --> 03:53:01,000
Let's go for it

3081
03:53:02,000 --> 03:53:04,000
Let's go for it

3082
03:53:04,000 --> 03:53:06,000
I need to

3083
03:53:06,000 --> 03:53:08,000
All right

3084
03:53:08,000 --> 03:53:10,000
Press right

3085
03:53:12,000 --> 03:53:16,000
I was holding I was holding right I did something wrong look at all the deaths

3086
03:53:17,000 --> 03:53:19,000
A ton of people died there

3087
03:53:21,000 --> 03:53:25,000
I said something like he's in a car he's like a little bumper car

3088
03:53:29,000 --> 03:53:31,000
I'm in a little go card

3089
03:53:34,000 --> 03:53:36,000
Just think about how long this stuff to make

3090
03:53:38,000 --> 03:53:44,000
Mario in a go card now you just drive or a straight and bunch of cool things happen around you

3091
03:53:48,000 --> 03:53:50,000
You're like I'm playing braid

3092
03:53:54,000 --> 03:53:56,000
This is so cool

3093
03:53:57,000 --> 03:54:01,000
Damn, man some people are just super super crazy creative. It's awesome

3094
03:54:02,000 --> 03:54:04,000
That was awesome that was so cool

3095
03:54:14,000 --> 03:54:16,000
What else is there

3096
03:54:17,000 --> 03:54:19,000
Well the pyro that was made by the pyro

3097
03:54:24,000 --> 03:54:27,000
All right, what about what about don't press any this is the highest rated thing

3098
03:54:29,000 --> 03:54:32,000
We already saw a version of this didn't we let's check out this one

3099
03:54:34,000 --> 03:54:36,000
Don't press anything

3100
03:54:40,000 --> 03:54:42,000
What is even happening

3101
03:54:48,000 --> 03:54:50,000
Don't even like program this

3102
03:54:57,000 --> 03:54:59,000
Look at that look at that look at the close-down before I as well

3103
03:55:01,000 --> 03:55:04,000
Coolest roller coaster smart we

3104
03:55:09,000 --> 03:55:13,000
There's no way this person doesn't have an engineering degree

3105
03:55:13,000 --> 03:55:19,000
The person that made this level has a PhD in mechanical engineering

3106
03:55:29,000 --> 03:55:31,000
All right

3107
03:55:35,000 --> 03:55:41,000
What else is there how do you fail that you just have to just move you 40% clear right that means like

3108
03:55:41,000 --> 03:55:43,000
60% of the people just were walking around trying to jump

3109
03:55:46,000 --> 03:55:49,000
Okay, this is don't press anything to it's by the same guy

3110
03:55:54,000 --> 03:55:58,000
Yeah, I think it's the same guy right see how good the sequel is

3111
03:56:02,000 --> 03:56:04,000
Did I just get a cat paw

3112
03:56:04,000 --> 03:56:06,000
Oh

3113
03:56:08,000 --> 03:56:10,000
Okay, that was cool that was really cool

3114
03:56:17,000 --> 03:56:19,000
Is it say

3115
03:56:19,000 --> 03:56:21,000
Is it get sick of a dick

3116
03:56:22,000 --> 03:56:24,000
I'm pretty sure that's a dick

3117
03:56:24,000 --> 03:56:27,000
He's now the otherwise he's three hands. No, yeah, that was too armed

3118
03:56:27,000 --> 03:56:29,000
Oh

3119
03:56:32,000 --> 03:56:34,000
Now that's

3120
03:56:37,000 --> 03:56:40,000
Hardy time bring the disco somebody come

3121
03:56:42,000 --> 03:56:44,000
Who was never catching him

3122
03:56:48,000 --> 03:56:50,000
I didn't walk right there

3123
03:56:51,000 --> 03:56:53,000
Cool

3124
03:56:57,000 --> 03:57:00,000

It says a 60% clear right let's play this one. I do I get to move in this one?

How do I write a comment here

3147
03:58:35,000 --> 03:58:37,000
I

3148
03:58:40,000 --> 03:58:42,000
Oh, no Bowser oh shit

3149
03:58:43,000 --> 03:58:45,000
Now there's an actual game here

3150
03:58:46,000 --> 03:58:48,000

03:58:51,000 --> 03:58:54,000
Must buy I'm like just reading what the purple is saying look at all those deaths

3153
03:59:05,000 --> 03:59:07,000

I

3156
03:59:21,000 --> 03:59:23,000
Well, I died in that one because I'm reading all the weird text

3157
03:59:27,000 --> 03:59:29,000
Don't touch the shrooms

3158
03:59:31,000 --> 03:59:33,000
Sonic one

3159
03:59:33,000 --> 03:59:35,000
All right, I gotta check this one out

3160
03:59:37,000 --> 03:59:39,000
This is apparently sonic the hedgehog

3161
03:59:39,000 --> 03:59:41,000
I

3162
03:59:43,000 --> 03:59:45,000
Probably I should get that

3163
03:59:49,000 --> 03:59:52,000
So hold on a second wait a minute wait a minute go back

3164
03:59:54,000 --> 03:59:56,000
Kalei sonic the hedgehog is in the game

3165
03:59:57,000 --> 04:00:01,000
But that dude upload that or is that in this video game

3166
04:00:02,000 --> 04:00:05,000
That's sonic the fucking hedgehog in this game

3167
04:00:05,000 --> 04:00:14,000
I'm confused but I don't know I don't understand that's interesting to say the least

3168
04:00:19,000 --> 04:00:21,000
Um

3169
04:00:22,000 --> 04:00:24,000
That's surprising

3170
04:00:26,000 --> 04:00:29,000
Oh, is it a mebo it's an amoebo

3171
04:00:35,000 --> 04:00:37,000

04:04:18,000 --> 04:04:22,000
Up all right, okay, we did we did the dance party

04:04:41,000 --> 04:04:43,000
wouldn't

3224
04:04:46,000 --> 04:04:48,000
All right, he's gonna pack my level where's his pack my level

3225
04:04:55,000 --> 04:04:58,000
Cuz I'm gonna have to buy a pack man and me bo if that's in the game

3226
04:04:59,000 --> 04:05:01,000
Hmm

3227
04:05:06,000 --> 04:05:08,000
Ultimate life form Bowser's trap

3228
04:05:11,000 --> 04:05:13,000
Pack Mario

3229
04:05:14,000 --> 04:05:16,000
Yes

3230
04:05:16,000 --> 04:05:18,000
Yes

3231
04:05:23,000 --> 04:05:25,000
Where's it

3232
04:05:29,000 --> 04:05:31,000
It's even the pack man with the big nose

3233
04:05:32,000 --> 04:05:34,000
But he turns into a banana

3234
04:05:35,000 --> 04:05:37,000
That's so cool

3235
04:05:38,000 --> 04:05:41,000
Can you do anything else besides just stand there like an idiot

3236
04:05:43,000 --> 04:05:45,000
All right, let's go

3237
04:05:49,000 --> 04:05:51,000
Oh look at when he swims he turns that's oh, that's so cool

3238
04:05:53,000 --> 04:05:55,000
I lost it already. I was too busy

3239
04:05:56,000 --> 04:05:58,000
I was too busy fanboying over pack man

3240
04:06:03,000 --> 04:06:05,000
You know when I first

3241
04:06:05,000 --> 04:06:07,000
purchased this game

3242
04:06:07,000 --> 04:06:12,000
I thought that it was going to be extremely limited and not fun

3243
04:06:14,000 --> 04:06:16,000
This is pretty cool though. Can't go down what

3244
04:06:26,000 --> 04:06:28,000
I

3245
04:06:31,000 --> 04:06:33,000
Don't know

3246
04:06:36,000 --> 04:06:38,000
You can press up. I just want to look at him one more time

3247
04:06:41,000 --> 04:06:43,000
Let me get it give me the pack man

3248
04:06:43,000 --> 04:06:45,000
Oh

3249
04:06:50,000 --> 04:06:52,000
He'll let a fruit

3250
04:06:54,000 --> 04:06:56,000
That's awesome

3251
04:07:01,000 --> 04:07:03,000
Go go go go go go go go go

3252
04:07:04,000 --> 04:07:09,000
How can I actually run into them come on but whatever

3253
04:07:09,000 --> 04:07:11,000
Oh

3254
04:07:14,000 --> 04:07:16,000
Easy easy

3255
04:07:22,000 --> 04:07:24,000
I did it

3256
04:07:25,000 --> 04:07:27,000
All right

3257
04:07:27,000 --> 04:07:30,000
Maybe one or two more and I'm probably gonna hit pay tip of the hats as well

3258
04:07:31,000 --> 04:07:35,000
Is tomorrow I should probably be up I got some work that's being done still

3259
04:07:39,000 --> 04:07:46,000
But thank you guys for coming out then witnessing my um

3260
04:07:49,000 --> 04:07:51,000
My very bad not good

3261
04:07:54,000 --> 04:07:57,000
Playing this game it was fun though

3262
04:07:58,000 --> 04:08:00,000
There was a couple of points that I was getting uh

3263
04:08:01,000 --> 04:08:05,000
Getting super salty. Oh wow so much so salty

3264
04:08:06,000 --> 04:08:08,000
It's fun. This is this is great game

3265
04:08:10,000 --> 04:08:14,000
Highly recommend if you uh are into this kind of thing it's really fun

3266
04:08:16,000 --> 04:08:20,000
Do one more we'll do one more hard one and I'll try it like five or ten times or something

3267
04:08:24,000 --> 04:08:27,000
Like courses so I'm gonna try to beat that one that was giving me trouble before

3268
04:08:27,000 --> 04:08:36,000
This one just the one with a two percent clear right

3269
04:08:40,000 --> 04:08:42,000
All right, let's try to remember how this worked

3270
04:08:48,000 --> 04:08:50,000
Oh, yeah, I forgot

3271
04:08:53,000 --> 04:08:56,000
Mr. Chops at least I don't have a set amount of lives here

3272
04:08:58,000 --> 04:09:07,000
So I should have done from the very beginning

3273
04:09:11,000 --> 04:09:13,000
Well, that's something I had to press

3274
04:09:18,000 --> 04:09:21,000
We didn't get you to put a fork in the outlet no we didn't

3275
04:09:24,000 --> 04:09:26,000
We did not

3276
04:09:27,000 --> 04:09:29,000
I

3277
04:09:29,000 --> 04:09:33,000
Also this this is my first time I've ever streamed out of console

3278
04:09:34,000 --> 04:09:36,000
So I have to work out the bugs

3279
04:09:37,000 --> 04:09:41,000
And all the you know kinks and stuff because there were quite a few them unfortunately

3280
04:09:44,000 --> 04:09:46,000
Gonna wait till they both up

3281
04:09:49,000 --> 04:09:51,000
Oh and jump up there join your friend

3282
04:09:57,000 --> 04:09:59,000
I would have gone through

3283
04:10:02,000 --> 04:10:04,000
I also gonna figure out that the delay

3284
04:10:06,000 --> 04:10:11,000
Not just like the random weird like input delay of feeling but the

3285
04:10:12,000 --> 04:10:14,000
Delay the audio that was happening

3286
04:10:20,000 --> 04:10:24,000
Some people has said that there's been a couple of flashes like it just flashed once or twice

3287
04:10:24,000 --> 04:10:26,000
I

3288
04:10:26,000 --> 04:10:28,000
Delay for some people I'll figure it out

3289
04:10:32,000 --> 04:10:34,000
I hope

3290
04:10:38,000 --> 04:10:42,000
I should have waited. Ah, I should have waited should I can stand right there and be totally fine

3291
04:10:43,000 --> 04:10:46,000
If I stand right there, they won't hit me with any of their crap

3292
04:10:48,000 --> 04:10:50,000
Way too long

3293
04:10:51,000 --> 04:10:55,000
I actually think I'll be able to get this I think I'll be able to beat this one. I warmed up enough and I played enough this game

3294
04:10:56,000 --> 04:10:58,000
And after a few minutes I should be able to get this

3295
04:11:11,000 --> 04:11:14,000
I wasn't I was looking over to the right just trying to get the opportunity to run

3296
04:11:20,000 --> 04:11:24,000
Yeah, I'm gonna try that this time. I'm gonna try to jump and hit them underneath

3297
04:11:26,000 --> 04:11:28,000
Seems like a good idea

3298
04:11:34,000 --> 04:11:36,000
Oh, I can't I cannot hit them, but I'm gonna say spot

3299
04:11:39,000 --> 04:11:41,000
No, they jumped down effort

3300
04:11:42,000 --> 04:11:45,000
See that just kind of threw a cog into my brain

3301
04:11:46,000 --> 04:11:48,000
When I couldn't hit them from underneath

3302
04:11:48,000 --> 04:11:50,000
I just assumed I was safe for some reason

3303
04:11:57,000 --> 04:11:59,000
I'm gonna be one of those two percent

3304
04:12:02,000 --> 04:12:05,000
I will be one of those two point seven percent people

3305
04:12:05,000 --> 04:12:07,000
I

3306
04:12:17,000 --> 04:12:19,000
Come on

3307
04:12:23,000 --> 04:12:26,000
I need to do too many now I'm in deep shit

3308
04:12:31,000 --> 04:12:33,000
I'm deep shit

3309
04:12:36,000 --> 04:12:38,000
I

3310
04:12:44,000 --> 04:12:48,000
I'm just like locked in right now. I did I was hypnotized

3311
04:12:50,000 --> 04:12:52,000
I was under legit hypnosis right there

3312
04:12:54,000 --> 04:12:56,000
I didn't know

3313
04:12:57,000 --> 04:12:59,000
Like I was at a magic show

3314
04:13:01,000 --> 04:13:03,000
You gotta go right

3315
04:13:05,000 --> 04:13:07,000
Now

3316
04:13:11,000 --> 04:13:14,000
Holy dog shit, okay, I need to wait to the end of that thing

3317
04:13:18,000 --> 04:13:21,000
I will be in the two point seven percent I'm gonna do it

3318
04:13:23,000 --> 04:13:25,000
I'm gonna do it

3319
04:13:25,000 --> 04:13:27,000
No, I know that happens at the end. I'm gonna do it

3320
04:13:27,000 --> 04:13:29,000
I

3321
04:13:34,000 --> 04:13:36,000
We are waiting for the one to fly up there

3322
04:13:44,000 --> 04:13:46,000
Shit

3323
04:13:46,000 --> 04:13:48,000
I could have gone up could have gone up

3324
04:13:50,000 --> 04:13:52,000
Could have gone up

3325
04:13:52,000 --> 04:13:56,000
As the worst part when you play through these levels there like kind of you have to memorize things and you see

3326
04:13:56,000 --> 04:14:00,000
Something right at the very end. I saw that right at the very end that I could have probably got a mushroom there

3327
04:14:06,000 --> 04:14:08,000
I don't think I have a good opportunity anymore

3328
04:14:10,000 --> 04:14:12,000
Uh, maybe right now

3329
04:14:14,000 --> 04:14:16,000
Nope right

3330
04:14:17,000 --> 04:14:19,000
Did they just throw way more than usual

3331
04:14:22,000 --> 04:14:24,000
Get out of here

3332
04:14:27,000 --> 04:14:29,000
Oh

3333
04:14:33,000 --> 04:14:40,000
You gotta be shitting me right now. You've got to be absolutely shitting me. I'm I'm just I'm very very mad at that one

3334
04:14:41,000 --> 04:14:43,000
I showed a hit him right now fucking crown of his head

3335
04:14:45,000 --> 04:14:47,000
That one was perfect

3336
04:14:47,000 --> 04:14:51,000
And then of course it all goes to hell like it typically does

3337
04:14:57,000 --> 04:15:01,000
I really want to stop this movie

3338
04:15:04,000 --> 04:15:06,000
Came off further than I thought

3339
04:15:11,000 --> 04:15:17,000
Actually really it should not have been I shouldn't have even attacked that guy. That was just a extremely stupid move

3340
04:15:18,000 --> 04:15:24,000
You've got to get it

3341
04:15:26,000 --> 04:15:29,000
Have to get this before I go to bed. That's extremely important

3342
04:15:42,000 --> 04:15:45,000
Guy throws a perfect pitch down the middle right there

3343
04:15:47,000 --> 04:15:49,000
Damn

3344
04:16:18,000 --> 04:16:20,000
Oh

3345
04:16:20,000 --> 04:16:22,000
I should have kept running

3346
04:16:26,000 --> 04:16:31,000
That's just surprising that only three percent of every person that's played this has been it. That's kind of funny

3347
04:16:33,000 --> 04:16:35,000
You think it'd be a lot more

3348
04:16:48,000 --> 04:16:50,000
I should just jump again

3349
04:16:53,000 --> 04:16:55,000
Showed of water color

3350
04:17:09,000 --> 04:17:11,000
This one's the fireballs it just get

3351
04:17:12,000 --> 04:17:15,000
Annoying and here comes a la key to whatever his name is

3352
04:17:18,000 --> 04:17:21,000
Kind of I you know drop down let me get you

3353
04:17:24,000 --> 04:17:26,000
What the hell was that what did he just do?

3354
04:17:27,000 --> 04:17:30,000
No, I got him I got a move. It's not gonna happen

3355
04:17:33,000 --> 04:17:35,000
Gonna watch over nine

3356
04:17:36,000 --> 04:17:40,000
Yeah, I'm just over that I'm over complicating things when I get there

3357
04:17:42,000 --> 04:17:46,000
Massively just over complicating the shit out of that every time I get there

3358
04:17:48,000 --> 04:17:52,000
I didn't you know I need you to jump as soon as I get over there jump jump jump and get up and kill him

3359
04:17:53,000 --> 04:17:58,000
Because he's such a pain in the ass at that part because he's throwing shit down when things are coming up

3360
04:18:02,000 --> 04:18:04,000
Well, I was literally was reading chat

3361
04:18:05,000 --> 04:18:07,000
My face is just down

3362
04:18:10,000 --> 04:18:12,000
Oh, it's very this is very possible

3363
04:18:13,000 --> 04:18:15,000
But you just need to do everything perfect

3364
04:18:15,000 --> 04:18:18,000
And at least close to it

3365
04:18:24,000 --> 04:18:26,000
And missed it and I just bad this threw me off big time

3366
04:18:32,000 --> 04:18:34,000
That double teamed

3367
04:18:34,000 --> 04:18:39,000
You want some of this too? Don't you no no no no, what am I thinking don't be a fucking idiot

3368
04:18:39,000 --> 04:18:41,000
I

3369
04:18:41,000 --> 04:18:43,000
Watch him

3370
04:18:43,000 --> 04:18:48,000
Watch out for that here comes another one. He's gonna throw it down right now. I can't even

3371
04:18:51,000 --> 04:18:56,000
I just I just I haven't gotten there in a long time. I have I just got I forgot that that's what yeah, I forgot I just

3372
04:18:57,000 --> 04:18:59,000
100% forgot

3373
04:18:59,000 --> 04:19:01,000
That it was like that. I don't know why

3374
04:19:02,000 --> 04:19:04,000
Get tired

3375
04:19:05,000 --> 04:19:07,000
Fuckin tired

3376
04:19:07,000 --> 04:19:12,000
You tell when you're getting tired when you're forgetting things that happened like three minutes ago

3377
04:19:19,000 --> 04:19:21,000
God stop throwing so many I hate when they do that shit

3378
04:19:24,000 --> 04:19:27,000
Yeah, you can't take the cloud, but it's getting up there is the issue

3379
04:19:29,000 --> 04:19:32,000
Because all the flames that are coming up and he's throwing shit down

3380
04:19:33,000 --> 04:19:38,000
All the while you're trying to not you're trying to do those jumps and avoid getting hit. It's just

3381
04:19:39,000 --> 04:19:41,000
A lot for your brain to have to do it the same time

3382
04:19:43,000 --> 04:19:45,000
Oh my god

3383
04:19:50,000 --> 04:19:56,000
Yeah, you can you can go the easy way, but I don't know I I feel like I've been doing it like this way so much and I'm

3384
04:19:57,000 --> 04:20:01,000
somewhat reliably getting past the hammer brothers until very recently

3385
04:20:03,000 --> 04:20:05,000
Uh, I'm getting I'm getting too sloppy

3386
04:20:10,000 --> 04:20:13,000
So I figured out why only three percent of people have ever beaten this level

3387
04:20:14,000 --> 04:20:16,000
I figured it out here's what it is

3388
04:20:17,000 --> 04:20:20,000
You do it like this many times and then you just go like this

3389
04:20:21,000 --> 04:20:23,000
I don't fucking care and you quit

3390
04:20:24,000 --> 04:20:26,000
I'm not gonna do that

3391
04:20:34,000 --> 04:20:38,000
Yeah, I have to beat this to go to bed. This is my this is my sleep ticket

3392
04:20:39,000 --> 04:20:42,000
You know it because this is my sleep ticket. I'm just gonna go in this way

3393
04:20:47,000 --> 04:20:52,000
Just forget what happened you don't even skip the hammer brothers over here. This actually it was more work to do that

3394
04:20:53,000 --> 04:20:55,000
Oh

3395
04:21:04,000 --> 04:21:07,000
Yeah, forget that it's not easier going that way

3396
04:21:08,000 --> 04:21:11,000
Just longer, but you get I mean you get the mushroom, but

3397
04:21:12,000 --> 04:21:14,000
I'll just try to get it over

3398
04:21:14,000 --> 04:21:16,000
Oh

3399
04:21:22,000 --> 04:21:27,000
It's just this there's like no opportunity to jump through that it uh

3400
04:21:27,000 --> 04:21:30,000
The opportunity to go through there is so small

3401
04:21:31,000 --> 04:21:33,000
Maybe it is yeah, it is I'm still deck

3402
04:21:36,000 --> 04:21:38,000
I'm just I'm gonna get the mushroom to

3403
04:21:39,000 --> 04:21:43,000
Because like the the 2% chance to get through those hammer brothers

3404
04:21:44,000 --> 04:21:47,000
It's seriously not fucking good, but I can just go through it every time if I just take this

3405
04:22:01,000 --> 04:22:03,000
I just I gotta remember when they are when they come up

3406
04:22:06,000 --> 04:22:09,000
If I didn't break that I wouldn't have freaked out about it

3407
04:22:10,000 --> 04:22:12,000
You

3408
04:22:12,000 --> 04:22:14,000
That he has to die

3409
04:22:14,000 --> 04:22:16,000
Immediately otherwise it's never gonna happen

3410
04:22:17,000 --> 04:22:21,000
Like right when I get down here and I get past the hammer brothers

3411
04:22:22,000 --> 04:22:24,000
This dude this dude's got a die

3412
04:22:24,000 --> 04:22:27,000
Like was this second example to shit

3413
04:22:28,000 --> 04:22:30,000
Oh

3414
04:22:36,000 --> 04:22:41,000
Oh, it's 3% of attempts not 3% of people will still that that's still a fucking tiny number

3415
04:22:42,000 --> 04:22:44,000
That's even worse

3416
04:22:46,000 --> 04:22:50,000
3% of attempts means that but just potentially like thousands of attempts of this level

3417
04:22:50,000 --> 04:22:52,000
I

3418
04:22:55,000 --> 04:22:58,000
Every that that one has hit me so many times I just keep trying to get through

3419
04:23:01,000 --> 04:23:03,000
How did you get this level again? I want to beat it before I go to sleep

3420
04:23:06,000 --> 04:23:08,000
In difficult as shit head level

3421
04:23:09,000 --> 04:23:11,000
Not getting the mushroom this time whatever

3422
04:23:13,000 --> 04:23:15,000
Do it with pure luck

3423
04:23:17,000 --> 04:23:19,000
No, I'm in trouble now

3424
04:23:21,000 --> 04:23:23,000
I

3425
04:23:24,000 --> 04:23:26,000
Had to go there but the stupid flames

3426
04:23:28,000 --> 04:23:30,000
Ah the flames man

3427
04:23:32,000 --> 04:23:34,000
All right, it's time to go

3428
04:23:39,000 --> 04:23:44,000
Yeah, I played the level with a 0% clear right that sucked I was on it for like an hour and 12 minutes

3429
04:23:44,000 --> 04:23:50,000
That level fucking eight shit

3430
04:23:59,000 --> 04:24:01,000
All right, he's gonna I don't know I don't know what happened

3431
04:24:02,000 --> 04:24:08,000
Why did I do like a little jump there? I just got like stuck on the pee thing what the fuck is that

3432
04:24:10,000 --> 04:24:12,000
That should not have happened

3433
04:24:15,000 --> 04:24:17,000
Oh

3434
04:24:24,000 --> 04:24:26,000
Jump it over that shit

3435
04:24:31,000 --> 04:24:33,000
No, I screwed up

3436
04:24:40,000 --> 04:24:42,000
Let's get it

3437
04:24:44,000 --> 04:24:46,000
There's not much more after this though

3438
04:24:47,000 --> 04:24:49,000
I mean there's a little bit but not a whole lot

3439
04:24:54,000 --> 04:24:56,000
No, I was gonna go right there that was a good opportunity

3440
04:25:02,000 --> 04:25:04,000
Whatever

3441
04:25:08,000 --> 04:25:10,000
God

3442
04:25:14,000 --> 04:25:16,000
I

3443
04:25:19,000 --> 04:25:25,000
Those flames are in a position where they're extremely difficult to avoid because you have to land there it seems

3444
04:25:27,000 --> 04:25:29,000
Get over here

3445
04:25:30,000 --> 04:25:32,000
Fuck you

3446
04:25:32,000 --> 04:25:34,000
Fuck everything you stand for

3447
04:25:41,000 --> 04:25:43,000
I don't have to worry about that guy anymore

3448
04:25:45,000 --> 04:25:47,000
Oh

3449
04:25:56,000 --> 04:26:00,000
I just have no opportunities to go anywhere oh it's again it began

3450
04:26:09,000 --> 04:26:11,000
I split already

3451
04:26:12,000 --> 04:26:14,000
Oh

3452
04:26:20,000 --> 04:26:23,000
Hi, I started to do the game to do that I looks down again

3453
04:26:27,000 --> 04:26:30,000
This shit is gonna try to be fucking crazy

3454
04:26:31,000 --> 04:26:34,000
I'm going to legit lose by fucking mind playing this game

3455
04:26:37,000 --> 04:26:39,000
I'm gonna wait for this dumb shit head to come back

3456
04:26:42,000 --> 04:26:44,000
Fuck your cloud

3457
04:26:44,000 --> 04:26:47,000
You could get in it but I keep killing him in the worst possible spot

3458
04:26:52,000 --> 04:26:54,000
Well, I didn't hold down be a long enough

3459
04:26:55,000 --> 04:26:57,000
I'm just unraveling at this point

3460
04:27:06,000 --> 04:27:08,000
I gotta kill him right here

3461
04:27:11,000 --> 04:27:15,000
Actually, wait wait, what the fuck star the star there

3462
04:27:18,000 --> 04:27:23,000
Holy shit, how do I get in there oh my god

3463
04:27:24,000 --> 04:27:26,000
Give me that thing

3464
04:27:29,000 --> 04:27:32,000
You serious I'm getting that

3465
04:27:32,000 --> 04:27:41,000
That's actually kind of hard to get

3466
04:27:43,000 --> 04:27:45,000
Oh dear, that's okay, I don't want to jump

3467
04:27:48,000 --> 04:27:50,000
Right no

3468
04:27:51,000 --> 04:27:53,000
Hmm close

3469
04:28:03,000 --> 04:28:06,000
That moment when you realize that the chat's been saying forever

3470
04:28:07,000 --> 04:28:12,000
Well, it's kind of hard to see chat because it's on my eye because I'm I'm facing away from my computer right now

3471
04:28:13,000 --> 04:28:20,000
So I have a lap I have my iPad sitting on my lap right now. That's how I'm reading chat because I'm facing away from my desk

3472
04:28:22,000 --> 04:28:24,000
I've got to figure this pattern out

3473
04:28:26,000 --> 04:28:28,000
Thought it was like that

3474
04:28:28,000 --> 04:28:30,000
It is I just have to go faster

3475
04:28:33,000 --> 04:28:36,000
I could yeah, I could just get the mushroom to try that

3476
04:28:37,000 --> 04:28:39,000
Just jump up and get it

3477
04:28:42,000 --> 04:28:44,000
Let's try that

3478
04:28:47,000 --> 04:28:49,000
Um

3479
04:28:49,000 --> 04:28:51,000
Yeah, I'm definitely getting away too tired to play this game

3480
04:28:53,000 --> 04:29:00,000
I was looking for the blue thing to jump on that's like how like just tired and just done playing this game. I am

3481
04:29:01,000 --> 04:29:03,000
Sleepy is all shit

3482
04:29:04,000 --> 04:29:06,000
Okay, we're here. I'm more excuses

3483
04:29:16,000 --> 04:29:18,000
Let's go

3484
04:29:25,000 --> 04:29:29,000
Hey, can you guys guess what happened there? I forgot about the end again

3485
04:29:29,000 --> 04:29:31,000
Because I hadn't been there in so long

3486
04:29:32,000 --> 04:29:34,000
But that's easy enough to do

3487
04:29:35,000 --> 04:29:40,000
I'm a strip of like six hours or something haven't I thank God my brain's doing explode

3488
04:29:48,000 --> 04:29:50,000
Do do do do

3489
04:29:53,000 --> 04:29:56,000
I'm so fucking tired. I just want to be done with it

3490
04:29:59,000 --> 04:30:01,000
I was a little sleepy

3491
04:30:04,000 --> 04:30:11,000
I got a fucking long day tomorrow too. I got to wake up wake up at like seven o'clock in the morning

3492
04:30:14,000 --> 04:30:20,000
There's like a construction guy gonna be here and then tip of the hats is all day. What am I why am I doing this right now?

3493
04:30:21,000 --> 04:30:24,000
I have like extremely important busy things to do tomorrow

3494
04:30:25,000 --> 04:30:29,000
And I'm playing a three percent completion rate fucking Mario maker game

3495
04:30:30,000 --> 04:30:33,000
Like what the hell am I doing

3496
04:30:40,000 --> 04:30:42,000
Oh god I hit the wall

3497
04:30:43,000 --> 04:30:45,000
Ah

3498
04:30:52,000 --> 04:30:58,000
Just like one eye is closed and shit. Okay, wake up get wake the fuck up. It's time. It's time to get this like done

3499
04:31:00,000 --> 04:31:03,000
Get there who cares just get through that. No, I just

3500
04:31:04,000 --> 04:31:06,000
I'm gonna frisbee my iPad into my wall

3501
04:31:07,000 --> 04:31:15,000
I'm gonna take I'm gonna take a fucking professional frisbee move and it's going straight through the dry wall

3502
04:31:16,000 --> 04:31:18,000
I'll never find it. It's just gonna go in. I'll never find it again

3503
04:31:24,000 --> 04:31:26,000
I'm gonna chat

3504
04:31:37,000 --> 04:31:43,000
All right slow it down

3505
04:31:45,000 --> 04:31:47,000
Kill this fucking asshole. Oh, he flew away from me

3506
04:31:51,000 --> 04:31:54,000
What an iPad gamer I've just uh

3507
04:32:00,000 --> 04:32:04,000
What I was making like a level why did I decide to do it? But I don't know why I decided to do this level

3508
04:32:05,000 --> 04:32:07,000
I wanted to do this for some dumb reason

3509
04:32:08,000 --> 04:32:11,000
It is so easy to it's just up so done

3510
04:32:15,000 --> 04:32:17,000
I was done like two hours ago

3511
04:32:21,000 --> 04:32:23,000
Fuck you give me a cloud

3512
04:32:28,000 --> 04:32:30,000
Get out of here

3513
04:32:31,000 --> 04:32:33,000
Give me out of the cloud

3514
04:32:34,000 --> 04:32:36,000
Mario, please get out of the cloud

3515
04:32:46,000 --> 04:32:48,000
This is this is this is this more to this is a lot more

3516
04:32:55,000 --> 04:32:59,000
Come on come over here shouldn't have gotten that tall

3517
04:33:04,000 --> 04:33:06,000
Oh my god

3518
04:33:09,000 --> 04:33:13,000
That's the end right there that's literally the end. That's that's the first time I'd ever seen that

3519
04:33:15,000 --> 04:33:17,000
At least I know that's the end

3520
04:33:19,000 --> 04:33:22,000
I have no idea what's happening there, but I know it's the end

3521
04:33:22,000 --> 04:33:24,000
I

3522
04:33:30,000 --> 04:33:33,000
Because it has the knife big the big knife

3523
04:33:42,000 --> 04:33:44,000
Here we go again

3524
04:33:44,000 --> 04:33:46,000
Oh, what is this?

3525
04:33:47,000 --> 04:33:49,000
Yeah, I'll take that absolutely

3526
04:33:52,000 --> 04:33:54,000
Oh

3527
04:33:56,000 --> 04:33:59,000
All right here we go again this one wasn't terrible

3528
04:34:00,000 --> 04:34:02,000
Although how am I supposed to get through this without getting hit

3529
04:34:02,000 --> 04:34:09,000
Besides like jumping up and jumping up. Yeah, that's how you do it. Okay. I don't know what this guy does

3530
04:34:15,000 --> 04:34:19,000
Wait, what do I have to get him to hit into this wall

3531
04:34:22,000 --> 04:34:24,000
I just need to know if that's what's happening or not

3532
04:34:26,000 --> 04:34:30,000
Don't worry. I died there intentionally. I was just seeing what I'm trying to figure out what the hell he does

3533
04:34:43,000 --> 04:34:46,000
I'm going to assume that that's what it is

3534
04:34:52,000 --> 04:34:54,000
Get that again

3535
04:34:56,000 --> 04:34:58,000
All right, what the fuck does that guy do?

3536
04:35:01,000 --> 04:35:05,000
Whoa, what the hell what's this? Oh god

3537
04:35:06,000 --> 04:35:11,000
That's the that's the level being completed right there. Okay, I just didn't even realize what the hell is happening

3538
04:35:16,000 --> 04:35:18,000
Oh

3539
04:35:19,000 --> 04:35:21,000
I

3540
04:35:21,000 --> 04:35:23,000
Just gonna push the pee block

3541
04:35:27,000 --> 04:35:33,000
Oh, I I get it. I okay. I get it. I see all right. I understand no I understand

3542
04:35:36,000 --> 04:35:38,000
I understand

3543
04:35:38,000 --> 04:35:40,000
There's just the pee blocks just keep falling I get it

3544
04:35:42,000 --> 04:35:45,000
You just gotta keep hitting them make sense make sense

3545
04:35:49,000 --> 04:35:51,000
You

3546
04:35:53,000 --> 04:35:56,000
That's the first time I've died of that guy for obvious reasons

3547
04:36:05,000 --> 04:36:07,000
It'd be nice to take the three hits to

3548
04:36:10,000 --> 04:36:12,000
I have no idea what the fuck I was doing there

3549
04:36:14,000 --> 04:36:16,000
Nothing smart that's for sure

3550
04:36:18,000 --> 04:36:20,000
I

3551
04:36:22,000 --> 04:36:24,000
Nothing smart that is for sure

3552
04:36:31,000 --> 04:36:34,000
Don't take unnecessary damage for no reason please

3553
04:36:38,000 --> 04:36:40,000
Yeah, that's not messed this up

3554
04:36:42,000 --> 04:36:44,000
Oh come on

3555
04:36:48,000 --> 04:36:50,000
Oh

3556
04:36:53,000 --> 04:36:55,000
Waiting for the fire

3557
04:37:03,000 --> 04:37:05,000
Actually shouldn't have stepped on that stupid

3558
04:37:08,000 --> 04:37:10,000
Well fire fire fire

3559
04:37:18,000 --> 04:37:20,000
Oh

3560
04:37:22,000 --> 04:37:24,000
Ah the fire I forgot about the fucking fire again

3561
04:37:34,000 --> 04:37:40,000
I thought he was going up I really seriously thought he was going up and not coming straight down like that

3562
04:37:43,000 --> 04:37:47,000
Well, I got both their patterns this should be over very soon

3563
04:37:48,000 --> 04:37:50,000
And I use that term very very

3564
04:37:53,000 --> 04:37:55,000
And then I can go to bed

3565
04:38:02,000 --> 04:38:04,000
I overshot that big time

3566
04:38:07,000 --> 04:38:11,000
Ah fuck that was very close that was unnecessarily close

3567
04:38:15,000 --> 04:38:17,000
That was extremely unnecessary

3568
04:38:18,000 --> 04:38:20,000
Oh

3569
04:38:22,000 --> 04:38:27,000
Okay, wipe the hand stone wipe the hand stone

3570
04:38:30,000 --> 04:38:35,000
It's easy there's no reason to sprint around all over the place that are very very very manageable patterns

3571
04:38:40,000 --> 04:38:42,000
This lasts a long time

3572
04:38:44,000 --> 04:38:46,000
Easy peasy

3573
04:38:48,000 --> 04:38:50,000
I

3574
04:38:58,000 --> 04:39:00,000
Didn't know when the fire was happening

3575
04:39:12,000 --> 04:39:14,000
Fire fuck no

3576
04:39:15,000 --> 04:39:17,000
Oh god damn it

3577
04:39:18,000 --> 04:39:20,000
So fucking tedious

3578
04:39:23,000 --> 04:39:26,000
You know I died in the exact same spot

3579
04:39:32,000 --> 04:39:34,000
You do that like six times that sucks

3580
04:39:39,000 --> 04:39:43,000
Do look at how I've just become so like mesmerized that I'm just doing this

3581
04:39:43,000 --> 04:39:47,000
I'm not even playing the game right now my muscle memories is doing this

3582
04:39:47,000 --> 04:39:49,000
It's part again

3583
04:39:53,000 --> 04:39:55,000
I'm gonna beat this guy's don't worry

3584
04:40:01,000 --> 04:40:03,000
Hmm

3585
04:40:04,000 --> 04:40:09,000
There will the secret door there's no secret door that secret door is not real

3586
04:40:12,000 --> 04:40:14,000
It's the fire that's screwing me up

3587
04:40:17,000 --> 04:40:23,000
Let's keep better remember the wood now these two are shit heads don't forget about the fire

3588
04:40:29,000 --> 04:40:33,000
I'm gonna hit yeah, I'm gonna keep shit now

3589
04:40:47,000 --> 04:40:48,000
I

3590
04:40:48,000 --> 04:40:52,000
Just the random random random random random random directions that they go

3591
04:40:54,000 --> 04:40:56,000
You just have to go it's in the fire too

3592
04:40:58,000 --> 04:41:01,000
So close I'm so close to defeating this

3593
04:41:11,000 --> 04:41:16,000
I'm so glad I didn't do this anymore. I can try to get better at the uh next part

3594
04:41:17,000 --> 04:41:20,000
And pick pick the flower up you dumbass

3595
04:41:22,000 --> 04:41:25,000
God do I have to be such a dumbass sometimes seriously

3596
04:41:30,000 --> 04:41:33,000
I'll get it right. Oh, let me screw up. I'm just gonna thought that was it right there

3597
04:41:34,000 --> 04:41:36,000
All right, I need to move I need to I'm putting the iPad down

3598
04:41:37,000 --> 04:41:39,000
Get this shit off my lap. Let me sit forward

3599
04:41:41,000 --> 04:41:43,000
Let's go

3600
04:41:47,000 --> 04:41:49,000
Oh

3601
04:42:17,000 --> 04:42:19,000
F*** you game!

3602
04:42:32,000 --> 04:42:34,000
F*** you game!

3603
04:42:37,000 --> 04:42:39,000
God, that was...

3604
04:42:47,000 --> 04:42:49,000
F*** you game!

3605
04:42:52,000 --> 04:42:54,000
F*** you game!

3606
04:42:57,000 --> 04:42:59,000
So, uh...

3607
04:43:00,000 --> 04:43:01,000
You guys...

3608
04:43:01,000 --> 04:43:03,000
You guys ready to go to bed?

3609
04:43:06,000 --> 04:43:08,000
Oh boy...

3610
04:43:10,000 --> 04:43:12,000
Yay!

3611
04:43:13,000 --> 04:43:15,000
I beat Mr. Chomp's dog house.

3612
04:43:17,000 --> 04:43:19,000
F*** you game!

3613
04:43:25,000 --> 04:43:27,000
What do the people say?

3614
04:43:27,000 --> 04:43:29,000
What do the people say?

3615
04:43:29,000 --> 04:43:31,000
Let's see what they say.

3616
04:43:39,000 --> 04:43:41,000
He said...

3617
04:43:42,000 --> 04:43:44,000
F*** you game!

3618
04:43:44,000 --> 04:43:46,000
Uh...

3619
04:43:46,000 --> 04:43:48,000
Murt, uh...

3620
04:43:48,000 --> 04:43:50,000
Thank you.

3621
04:43:50,000 --> 04:43:53,000
You just killed my Mario 100 run, but in high-level.

3622
04:43:54,000 --> 04:43:56,000
See, in 15 years...

3623
04:43:56,000 --> 04:43:58,000
Fun, awesome, final boss.

3624
04:43:58,000 --> 04:44:00,000
Go up if you want to have an easier time.

3625
04:44:02,000 --> 04:44:06,000
This poor guy, this poor guy got his 100 run killed.

3626
04:44:07,000 --> 04:44:10,000
Uh, okay, well there is the number if you need it.

3627
04:44:14,000 --> 04:44:16,000
That was really cool.

3628
04:44:16,000 --> 04:44:18,000
That was really fun.

3629
04:44:18,000 --> 04:44:20,000
If you think that uh...

3630
04:44:21,000 --> 04:44:23,000
Tortured is fun.

3631
04:44:28,000 --> 04:44:30,000
By Cuddly.

3632
04:44:30,000 --> 04:44:32,000
Oh!

3633
04:44:32,000 --> 04:44:34,000
Alright guys.

3634
04:44:34,000 --> 04:44:37,000
Now, it's like funny now that I look back at this level.

3635
04:44:38,000 --> 04:44:42,000
It's actually very, very easy once you know exactly what's happening.

3636
04:44:42,000 --> 04:44:45,000
But that's the problem with all these levels is like...

3637
04:44:45,000 --> 04:44:49,000
I died a million times on things that I just didn't understand.

3638
04:44:55,000 --> 04:44:58,000
I just want to see one thing.

3639
04:44:59,000 --> 04:45:02,000
No, it's a featured.

3640
04:45:05,000 --> 04:45:08,000
One shell.

3641
04:45:12,000 --> 04:45:13,000
Yeah, it's funny.

3642
04:45:13,000 --> 04:45:15,000
Looking back, like I'm like, how did I not beat that?

3643
04:45:15,000 --> 04:45:18,000
Like, I'm my first try, which is, you have no idea what the hell is going on.

3644
04:45:18,000 --> 04:45:21,000
And shit's flying all over the place.

3645
04:45:21,000 --> 04:45:23,000
This is a really fun game though.

3646
04:45:23,000 --> 04:45:24,000
Look at this one.

3647
04:45:24,000 --> 04:45:25,000
Look at this level.

3648
04:45:25,000 --> 04:45:27,000
What is even happening here?

3649
04:45:27,000 --> 04:45:28,000
This is not...

3650
04:45:28,000 --> 04:45:30,000
I'm not attempting to beat this or anything.

3651
04:45:30,000 --> 04:45:31,000
I just...

3652
04:45:32,000 --> 04:45:35,000
Just want to see what it is.

3653
04:45:40,000 --> 04:45:42,000
Dude, here.

3654
04:45:47,000 --> 04:45:50,000
Okay, that leads to nothing.

3655
04:45:52,000 --> 04:45:55,000
Probably needs to jump off his head.

3656
04:45:56,000 --> 04:45:58,000
No.

3657
04:46:02,000 --> 04:46:06,000
I'm kind of confused by this level.

3658
04:46:10,000 --> 04:46:13,000
What the hell is this?

3659
04:46:13,000 --> 04:46:16,000
Oh shit, okay.

3660
04:46:16,000 --> 04:46:19,000
Ugh!

3661
04:46:19,000 --> 04:46:22,000
Alright guys, I'm gonna take off.

3662
04:46:22,000 --> 04:46:24,000
Thanks for watching.

3663
04:46:24,000 --> 04:46:30,000
If you're new, if you just found this stream, I'm real fucking goddamn sorry.

3664
04:46:30,000 --> 04:46:32,000
That you had to watch that.

3665
04:46:32,000 --> 04:46:36,000
Maybe fail miserably over and over again at this game.

3666
04:46:36,000 --> 04:46:38,000
Yeah.

3667
04:46:38,000 --> 04:46:41,000
Hi, my name's Jeremy.

3668
04:46:41,000 --> 04:46:43,000
But, otherwise do you take these guys?

3669
04:46:43,000 --> 04:46:47,000
See, most of you at Tip of the Hats tomorrow.

3670
04:46:47,000 --> 04:46:56,000
I think I'll be there at either one or four, I think, is what I'm gonna be starting on it.

3671
04:46:56,000 --> 04:46:58,000
Yeah, good night guys.

3672
04:46:58,000 --> 04:47:03,000
Have a wonderful, wonderful evening, rest of your night, rest of your day, whatever we are.

3673
04:47:03,000 --> 04:47:04,000
Good night.

3674
04:47:04,000 --> 04:47:05,000
Goodbye.

3675
04:47:05,000 --> 04:47:07,000
Good bye.
