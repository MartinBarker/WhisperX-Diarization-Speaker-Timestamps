1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:10,000
Go zie

2
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:17,000
So

3
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:35,000
e

4
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:40,000
a

5
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:53,000
is

6
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:56,000
his

7
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:59,000
evils early as both is because the began at Microsoft

8
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:02,000
force

9
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:05,000
and told you

10
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:07,000
that told you was a happened

11
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:11,000
What a great streamer.

12
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:17,000
You know, most people when they stream, they're like, they have like you, if you can get

13
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:19,000
used to their schedule, you get to get to the sky.

14
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:21,000
It's always live at this particular time.

15
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:27,000
He's always going to be, no, no, this is, it's 5 a.m. right now.

16
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:30,000
What, what am I doing here right now?

17
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:34,000
Ugh, I should be in bed.

18
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:39,000
But no, I'm not in bed.

19
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:48,000
Is there a reason why we're streaming at 5 in the morning?

20
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:49,000
No.

21
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:55,000
Actually, the kind of is, I'm trying to reset my sleep schedule.

22
00:01:56,000 --> 00:02:02,000
And what better way to do that than to get my gamer license back?

23
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:07,000
Because if you missed the last stream, my gamer license was revoked.

24
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:12,000
I had guppy and like seven familiars in the binding of Isaac.

25
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:18,000
And I lost and my gamer license was revoked.

26
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:24,000
So to get it back, we're going to play Super Meatball.

27
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:26,000
This is an old classic.

28
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:31,000
I actually, I played through this game on my channel like three years ago.

29
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:40,000
But I'm just going to chill.

30
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:43,000
I'm going to play it.

31
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:45,000
I'm going to play Cryptarch too.

32
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:47,000
We'll see how far I get with this.

33
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:51,000
I might just do like the first or second chapter and then switch to Cryptarch.

34
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:53,000
Because that's like a current game.

35
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:56,000
But I'm going to warm up with some Meatball.

36
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:59,000
It's been a while.

37
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:06,000
Holy crap, my computer is burning.

38
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:12,000
You get, I would get a fire extinguisher and spray it.

39
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:19,000
But we're going to play a couple games to keep me awake.

40
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:22,000
Start with Meatball.

41
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:23,000
Warm up a little bit.

42
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:25,000
Play a little bit of Cryptarch.

43
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:28,000
If I'll be getting a juke.

44
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:32,000
If I complete the forest and into, I'd say like the first two or three chapters,

45
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:34,000
then you can, you know, you got your junior license.

46
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:36,000
I have my Learnage permit.

47
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:42,000
But without further ado, we're going to get this off the screen.

48
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:44,000
We all know the story.

49
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:49,000
I deleted this blast save file I had here.

50
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:52,000
So this is completely clean, fresh slate.

51
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:57,000
We're going to go for A pluses on every single one of these at least initial levels.

52
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:02,000
Why don't you put your chat in the stream display?

53
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:05,000
Well, I have no idea how to do that.

54
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:09,000
And just before we get started, I guess we'll address this.

55
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:11,000
We're going to address this, okay?

56
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:14,000
I get a lot of people asking me about, um,

57
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:17,000
well, I think that these first few levels are brainless.

58
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:20,000
Um, I get questions all the time about like,

59
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:22,000
what are you going to do this when you're going to do that?

60
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:25,000
When are you going to XYZ?

61
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:26,000
Where's this sub button?

62
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:28,000
How can I donate to you?

63
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:29,000
Why do you not show ads?

64
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:31,000
Your stream sucks.

65
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:32,000
Where's your overlay?

66
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:37,000
Honestly, this like first month or so,

67
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:40,000
trying to like stream a lot more often.

68
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:47,000
Is more so a trial run from me to see how like settings work than anything else?

69
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:52,000
You know, like, uh, could I do all that stuff?

70
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:56,000
But no, I want to make sure like I can actually stream with like a constant bit rate.

71
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:00,000
I'm actually going to do that again.

72
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:07,000
But fate like stuff like face cam will never,

73
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:09,000
will never, ever be on this channel.

74
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:19,000
You're your examples came back positive for LSD, cocaine and TCP,

75
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:22,000
but there were no performance enhancing drugs.

76
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:25,000
Well, that's good to know.

77
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:27,000
Shit.

78
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:34,000
I forgot to say this is supposed to be a non-death playthrough.

79
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:36,000
I wouldn't die one time.

80
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:42,000
Alright, how do you, this one's just a big add set.

81
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:46,000
I've already died too many times here, I think.

82
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:48,000
I'm gonna find out.

83
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:54,000
Alright, I think the band-aids.

84
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:56,000
I've totally forgot about the band-aids in this game.

85
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:59,000
Oh shit, that was a word.

86
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:01,000
I can't fuck this up.

87
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:03,000
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

88
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:05,000
Slow down.

89
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:08,000
I'm trying to get my gamer license back and not throw it at the trash.

90
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:22,000
Oops.

91
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:26,000
Okay, you can command a video for this one.

92
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:29,000
I actually don't remember.

93
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:40,000
Oh shit, I didn't even know I forgot about the ones at the top.

94
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:44,000
Okay, I gotta be careful with this.

95
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:53,000
Okay.

96
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:58,000
Sky pup.

97
00:06:58,000 --> 00:06:59,000
Well, I did it.

98
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:02,000
There's all kinds of secrets that I forget in this game, but I did that one.

99
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:06,000
I think there's something else you have to do in there.

100
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:10,000
Was the Wonder Book video the video that cost your entire bank account? No.

101
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:13,000
Dude, a Wonder Book.

102
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:19,000
A Wonder Book is like $8 for the Wonder Book and the game.

103
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:22,000
It's not that expensive.

104
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:24,000
That stuff is so old.

105
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:31,000
Wonder Books is like, I really wish we'd see more of that shit though.

106
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:36,000
It's so cool. Whoa, whoa, didn't get an A plus.

107
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:41,000
Excuse me. I also didn't get this.

108
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:44,000
Fuck.

109
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:51,000
No, we're not getting the A plus zero. We get the band-aid.

110
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:05,000
Now we'll get the A plus.

111
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:08,000
It's magic for crying out loud.

112
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:15,000
What the fuck?

113
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:19,000
Was it five seconds?

114
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:24,000
What's the quick restart button? I know it exists.

115
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:26,000
Is it select?

116
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:30,000
I'll figure that out.

117
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:37,000
Nothing I gotta get used to is the Xbox One controller.

118
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:40,000
Shit.

119
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:44,000
The Xbox One controller is kind of odd because we'll go over this too.

120
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:52,000
Every single one of the, because I don't use the analog, all the D-pads are individual buttons.

121
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:54,000
So it's kind of odd.

122
00:08:54,000 --> 00:09:00,000
You know, when you scroll your thumb across the bottom of the Xbox One controller, it's like...

123
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:05,000
It just kind of feels awkward because I'm pushing my hand over popcorn kernels.

124
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:09,000
I'll get used to it though.

125
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:18,000
No, that's not gonna... No, just die again.

126
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:21,000
Here we go.

127
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:27,000
My PlayStation fan, I'm an all-game fan. I like all games.

128
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:32,000
Doesn't matter what it is.

129
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:35,000
All the D-pads?

130
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:40,000
All the D-pads.

131
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:51,000
I'm gonna get the Band-Aid on this as well, because you gotta get the Band-Aids.

132
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:55,000
Shit, I blew it.

133
00:09:55,000 --> 00:10:01,000
But if they made like a wonder book for the PS4, it's not because just like, oh yeah, I can't wait to make like a video on it.

134
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:05,000
That like is actually a very cool concept.

135
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:08,000
Shit.

136
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:10,000
They made four games for that thing.

137
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:12,000
There was an unannounced like...

138
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:19,000
Alright, hold on, hold on. Let me get this Band-Aid and we'll talk.

139
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:24,000
Fuck you.

140
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:32,000
Oh my god, alright, I gotta stop going on that one. That's the big-sum mistake.

141
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:35,000
Oh, I did it anyway. Alright, fuck it. We're not even getting the Band-Aid.

142
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:39,000
I'll get it later.

143
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:47,000
I don't know, we gonna do it again?

144
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:51,000
That was really sloppy. I could make that cleaner.

145
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:58,000
This is also really sloppy, but you know, still got it.

146
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:07,000
I actually like the feel of the Xbox One controller, where the buttons are placed and where the analog is replaced.

147
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:10,000
I could really do without how loud this fucking thing is.

148
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:17,000
Really, like every single one of these buttons, it's crazy. Like the bumpers, I'm gonna hit serious of buttons on this controller.

149
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:19,000
You'll hear it, ready?

150
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:29,000
Like half the buttons on this thing make a really loud annoying noise.

151
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:34,000
Especially the bumpers. Those are so loud.

152
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:45,000
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

153
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:54,000
I was gonna skip the Band-Aids for now. We're going for A-plosses.

154
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:05,000
I'm not catching them now, actually.

155
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:15,000
I wanna go on the warp zone.

156
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:26,000
Oh, the steam, that's right, the steam controller did release.

157
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:31,000
Or kind of, isn't it like, can you use it or something if it is a beta or something like that?

158
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:35,000
Oh, I sip on coffee. This is the commander video level, right?

159
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:38,000
I believe it is. It is.

160
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:43,000
Oh, right. Okay. You can like use it when you...

161
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:46,000
Okay. I got it.

162
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:52,000
Commander Video actually thinks my favorite character in this game. If I remember.

163
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:05,000
I must have watched the Super Meat Boy playthrough 15 times.

164
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:09,000
Well, now you get to see one live. I don't know if this is gonna be a playthrough or not.

165
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:16,000
I'm just kind of playing just to keep myself awake and warm up my video game skills.

166
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:23,000
Well, I officiate your bar mitzvah.

167
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:29,000
I don't think I have the qualifications to do that.

168
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:35,000
You know what I mean? I don't have... That's a easy bandaid, I'll get it.

169
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:41,000
I don't have... That's a easy bandaid, I'll get it.

170
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:46,000
I'm rushing it a little too much.

171
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:50,000
How many of these sound effects are using the Isaac?

172
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:55,000
Yeah, I'd be surprised. I mean, it is the same team, right?

173
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:58,000
That was stupid.

174
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:02,000
I'm not gonna use it.

175
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:07,000
That was still an A plus.

176
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:14,000
Wow.

177
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:19,000
How many times have I completed this game?

178
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:24,000
Maybe like three? Maybe a little bit less than that?

179
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:28,000
Maybe a little bit less than that?

180
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:30,000
What does that mean?

181
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:32,000
I completed it maybe two or three times.

182
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:35,000
Or maybe a little bit less than two and a half?

183
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:39,000
Yeah, that is true.

184
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:43,000
I've completed this game maybe two and a half times.

185
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:47,000
One of those playthroughs in particular, not the one that I did on my channel,

186
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:49,000
but just in particular.

187
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:52,000
I was really into it. Super duper.

188
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:56,000
Ultra into this game.

189
00:14:56,000 --> 00:15:01,000
That was a long time ago though.

190
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:04,000
No, another here.

191
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:06,000
When did this game come out?

192
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:13,000
Whenever the launch of Super Meepoi was, it was like my favorite game for that like year that it was out.

193
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:17,000
2009 does 10.

194
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:22,000
Am I gonna go for all A pluses in the playthrough?

195
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:25,000
I can try.

196
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:28,000
It's gonna be fucking hard though.

197
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:29,000
Am I doing?

198
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:34,000
You just do this.

199
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:39,000
I don't want to get that bandaid.

200
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:41,000
It's really not that hard.

201
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:43,000
It's all about just sitting here.

202
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:45,000
I could just time it like this.

203
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:49,000
I don't have to go fast anymore.

204
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:54,000
Oh fuck.

205
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:56,000
Fuck.

206
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:58,000
Can't get caught up in the bandaid.

207
00:15:58,000 --> 00:15:59,000
This is an A plus run.

208
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:05,000
Nothing more, nothing less.

209
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:12,000
I'm not having my chance right there.

210
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:17,000
The game, the game is gaming license never existed.

211
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:22,000
If you do it is tofu boy.

212
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:25,000
Are any levels even completeable with tofu boy?

213
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:28,000
I thought that the game was uncompletable if you played with him.

214
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:35,000
Because he can only jump like 5 feet in the air or something.

215
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:52,000
See you.

216
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:53,000
Whoa.

217
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:54,000
My eyes just deceived me right there.

218
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:56,000
That was weird.

219
00:16:56,000 --> 00:17:03,000
For some reason I thought I was much lower than I was.

220
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:10,000
Hmm.

221
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:18,000
A plus array.

222
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:21,000
Burger boy should be playable in this game.

223
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:23,000
I agree.

224
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:32,000
These aren't that hard to A plus.

225
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:35,000
Am I streaming at 5am?

226
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:36,000
I don't know.

227
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:37,000
It's a fun.

228
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:44,000
For fun sake.

229
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:49,000
Because why not, right?

230
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:58,000
I'm trying to put the squirrels.

231
00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:01,000
Give me that A plus.

232
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:07,000
Because you've lost control of your life.

233
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:13,000
Yeah, I guess.

234
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:15,000
Hey, we won.

235
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:16,000
No dark world.

236
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:17,000
Only three bandages.

237
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:19,000
Two of the two warps.

238
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:21,000
I don't remember at all.

239
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:28,000
But the other two warps are.

240
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:43,000
Oh, I don't know what your gold PS4 is.

241
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:50,000
I'm not sure.

242
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:58,000
There we go.

243
00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:01,000
Have I heard the invasion TF2 update?

244
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:05,000
That's pretty good.

245
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:08,000
It was pretty fun.

246
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:11,000
I should probably use Bicer Use Commander video for more or less.

247
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:16,000
Oh, come on now. This is not gonna be an A+.

248
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:18,000
I'm just gonna walk into the wall because it's not an A+.

249
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:22,000
Now that's keeps on fucking me up.

250
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:27,000
Wow! What am I doing here?

251
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:36,000
Whoa, I got stuck there.

252
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:45,000
I don't even know how to do that. I can just keep going the whole way.

253
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:55,000
Oh, I got too scared. Still on A+.

254
00:19:57,000 --> 00:20:01,000
Commander video is useless. Yeah, it's fun to play. I like being on a float around. It's fun.

255
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:07,000
It doesn't like float around this commander video.

256
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:16,000
Do I have anything planned for Halloween? I have a video I want to make for Halloween,

257
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:17,000
but I don't even think it's gonna be possible.

258
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:21,000
Like, I really don't think it's a possible video to make.

259
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:25,000
I so badly want to do it though.

260
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:27,000
It could be so much fun.

261
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:34,000
I

262
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:42,000
try marking the ninja. I actually told me that that game is really good.

263
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:44,000
I don't remember who it was.

264
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:52,000
Oh, no, no, I sprayed that up. I'm going for speed here.

265
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:57,000
Yeah, I sprayed it up again, but it's okay.

266
00:20:59,000 --> 00:20:59,000
No, nothing more.

267
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:06,000
Yeah, there we go.

268
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:13,000
How often do my 30-year-old eyes deceive me all the time?

269
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:27,000
More than you would think.

270
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:35,000
Give me the band-aid. Give me the band-aid.

271
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:41,000
Give me the band-aid. Give me this thing. Stop it. Thank you.

272
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:46,000
Oh, the love of all the band-aid.

273
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:53,000
I don't think I had enough.

274
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:55,000
I

275
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:01,000
best one-to-book game.

276
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:06,000
I don't know. That's a good question.

277
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:09,000
They're all fun. They're all interesting.

278
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:14,000
I've been over here for a while.

279
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:16,000
Yeah.

280
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:22,000
Hmm, I sprayed it up again.

281
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:27,000
Just screwing shit up, you know. I don't know how we do it around here.

282
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:35,000
What am I doing wrong here? I like remember just being able to drop down, right?

283
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:41,000
Yeah.

284
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:46,000
I

285
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:52,000
punch game.

286
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:54,000
This one more wonder book to play.

287
00:22:56,000 --> 00:23:02,000
I have no idea how it is. I feel like it's not going to be that funny, but I've said that before

288
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:04,000
and some of the most times I've said that.

289
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:08,000
End up being like some of my favorite things I've ever recorded.

290
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:12,000
Like that GTA 5, like grab the Auto 5, all like the mobile ripoffs.

291
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:15,000
I really did. I like I didn't know if like I was going to want to make that.

292
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:19,000
Like I sat there for a second. I'm like, do it.

293
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:19,000
Is this funny?

294
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:24,000
Is this like what am I what I'm doing right now? Is this worth me doing?

295
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:30,000
I downloaded like 30 of those games and I'm just sitting there thinking,

296
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:32,000
what was this the right call?

297
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:34,000
Should I fucking done this?

298
00:23:35,000 --> 00:23:40,000
I turns out I was one of my favorite things I've recorded in the last like,

299
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:42,000
probably at least six or 12 months.

300
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:51,000
German Lemmy or Infinite Wisdom in God damn how to pick up the ladies.

301
00:23:53,000 --> 00:23:55,000
I'm not sure you know this dude, but I am single.

302
00:23:58,000 --> 00:24:01,000
I'm currently single right now man. I don't know if I can give you the best advice on that.

303
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:09,000
Fuck the bandage. What am I doing?

304
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:14,000
Get in there. Get in there.

305
00:24:19,000 --> 00:24:22,000
How many videos get thrown under the rug only seen by like me and star?

306
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:26,000
More than you would probably imagine.

307
00:24:27,000 --> 00:24:29,000
Well, let's put it this way.

308
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:31,000
There are a lot of ideas.

309
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:35,000
And maybe not so much like the videos getting made.

310
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:41,000
But there's a lot of ideas that I would say get half made in and swept under the rug.

311
00:24:41,000 --> 00:24:44,000
I've made entire videos. I actually have an entire video that I made.

312
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:49,000
That I have never uploaded.

313
00:24:49,000 --> 00:24:52,000
It's just sitting there rendered ready for me to upload.

314
00:24:53,000 --> 00:24:55,000
And I'll never release it because I don't like it.

315
00:24:56,000 --> 00:25:06,000
Oh, that was quick.

316
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:18,000
But I don't know. I mean you guys probably noticed this recently.

317
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:24,000
The videos have the uploads have slowed down.

318
00:25:27,000 --> 00:25:32,000
And that's mainly because I want to like I've already talked about it.

319
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:35,000
I don't even need to talk about it again. I'm turning into a broken record about this.

320
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:43,000
Long story short. I want to just make the videos that I like to make.

321
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:48,000
Rather than you know, I gotta make a video every day. I have to make a video. I've

322
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:49,000
make like four videos a week.

323
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:55,000
I'm just I'm back to where I was a few years ago where I just was like, you know what?

324
00:25:55,000 --> 00:25:59,000
I like making these videos. I'm gonna make a video. I like making videos.

325
00:25:59,000 --> 00:26:11,000
Oh, shit.

326
00:26:15,000 --> 00:26:19,000
There's no time limit on these ones. There's no gold to get. There's no A plus to get here.

327
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:25,000
Just want to stay alive here.

328
00:26:25,000 --> 00:26:30,000
Whoa, he came out of nowhere.

329
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:39,000
Ooh, okay, hold on. Hold on a second here. Don't screw this one up. I don't want life left.

330
00:26:39,000 --> 00:26:55,000
Oh, fuck. Shit. Fuck. Dick. Every swear you can imagine. We gotta go back.

331
00:27:01,000 --> 00:27:04,000
Shit. I had that too. I just overreacted.

332
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:11,000
That was like a just a true testament to why you should never overreact in this game.

333
00:27:19,000 --> 00:27:24,000
You know, you probably should be just waiting here. I'm trying to remember all like the strats.

334
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:29,000
Wow, I get it again. All right, stop talking. Quiet, quiet that mouth of yours.

335
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:32,000
I can just beat this one so we can get out of here.

336
00:27:41,000 --> 00:27:44,000
All right, we're skipping this warp zone for now. We're gonna come back to it.

337
00:27:47,000 --> 00:27:53,000
I almost salvaged that. Whoa, what? Oh, right. I had to run into warp zone.

338
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:01,000
Oh, that's stuck.

339
00:28:13,000 --> 00:28:15,000
Hello.

340
00:28:15,000 --> 00:28:24,000
Yeah, I got I got I got I got canned from the DMV.

341
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:29,000
I would have loved to have grabbed that when I had the chance to get it.

342
00:28:37,000 --> 00:28:39,000
Oh, you fucker.

343
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:44,000
Shit. That wasn't cool.

344
00:28:45,000 --> 00:28:46,000
Yeah.

345
00:28:52,000 --> 00:28:54,000
Play it safe. Just get the band-aid.

346
00:28:54,000 --> 00:28:56,000
Yeah, I got a new plus out.

347
00:29:03,000 --> 00:29:06,000
I wonder who made all the squishy sound effects for this game. Yeah, you know,

348
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:11,000
that's a question gets on my mind sometimes. You call them fully artists, right?

349
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:13,000
Yeah.

350
00:29:13,000 --> 00:29:19,000
Guys, they just pretty much make weird sounds and hit meat with baseball bats and squish up

351
00:29:19,000 --> 00:29:23,000
toilet paper with their mouths to make sounds. That wasn't an eight plus excuse me.

352
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:34,000
I got locked my thumb. Got locked in there.

353
00:29:41,000 --> 00:29:43,000
Yeah.

354
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:57,000
No, just I gotta die. I'm gonna get over that quick enough.

355
00:30:05,000 --> 00:30:06,000
Here we go.

356
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:08,000
Oh.

357
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:11,000
Open up, please.

358
00:30:14,000 --> 00:30:16,000
Whoa.

359
00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:17,000
16 seconds is a plus.

360
00:30:19,000 --> 00:30:21,000
I mean, I don't know. I gotta go way faster than that.

361
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:25,000
No.

362
00:30:25,000 --> 00:30:27,000
Yeah.

363
00:30:35,000 --> 00:30:36,000
That's tough.

364
00:30:39,000 --> 00:30:42,000
13, 14, 15.

365
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:42,000
There it is.

366
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:51,000
That's why I'm single mean star.

367
00:30:52,000 --> 00:30:54,000
I don't know about that.

368
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:01,000
Whoa.

369
00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:04,000
I actually just forgot what this level did.

370
00:31:05,000 --> 00:31:06,000
You just go right to the right.

371
00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:13,000
Hey, how are you?

372
00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:24,000
Oh.

373
00:31:35,000 --> 00:31:36,000
Whoa. I missed that one.

374
00:31:41,000 --> 00:31:42,000
Oh, I messed up that one big time too.

375
00:31:43,000 --> 00:31:44,000
Fuck.

376
00:31:49,000 --> 00:31:50,000
Fuck.

377
00:31:52,000 --> 00:31:54,000
Oh.

378
00:31:58,000 --> 00:32:00,000
No.

379
00:32:07,000 --> 00:32:09,000
No, I messed up the timing already.

380
00:32:10,000 --> 00:32:12,000
Just walking to the dude. You gotta go right off the bat.

381
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:13,000
You gotta go one, two, three.

382
00:32:14,000 --> 00:32:15,000
Boom.

383
00:32:15,000 --> 00:32:16,000
Boom. No. I'm not. Okay. I'm all right.

384
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:20,000
No, no, no. I'm rocking this shit again.

385
00:32:22,000 --> 00:32:22,000
Oh.

386
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:25,000
Oh, fuck.

387
00:32:26,000 --> 00:32:28,000
Okay. I'm gonna fucking step on a rake.

388
00:32:29,000 --> 00:32:34,000
I'm gonna set up a rake in my backyard just so I can step on it like fucking side show Bob and the Simpsons.

389
00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:47,000
Chewie up. Oh, no. Whoa. I didn't get no way. I got a plus now.

390
00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:50,000
That's really, really annoying.

391
00:32:51,000 --> 00:32:54,000
What the hell was that? How would I just got an A plus for that?

392
00:32:54,000 --> 00:32:57,000
That was a C plus at best. That was like a C minus.

393
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:08,000
How high was I when I made the TF2 sound mod? I didn't, I didn't make the TF2 sound mode.

394
00:33:08,000 --> 00:33:09,000
That was somebody else.

395
00:33:09,000 --> 00:33:21,000
Hey, hey, all right. Let's try it. Let's try this again.

396
00:33:33,000 --> 00:33:34,000
Bob, Bob, I was just looking at the chat.

397
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:36,000
Whoops.

398
00:33:37,000 --> 00:33:42,000
This one has a specific pattern. I have just not going to even care about.

399
00:33:42,000 --> 00:33:44,000
I was just gonna try to do it on pure skill.

400
00:33:47,000 --> 00:33:49,000
Here we go.

401
00:33:49,000 --> 00:34:06,000
Wait, what is it? What does somebody say?

402
00:34:06,000 --> 00:34:10,000
Not YouTube because if it is, you must have made like $2 this three months with the rate of

403
00:34:10,000 --> 00:34:13,000
uploads and the content of it talking about Star and ArcGerma.

404
00:34:14,000 --> 00:34:21,000
You don't have to do something for money.

405
00:34:26,000 --> 00:34:30,000
Like, yeah, you can get paid for something but not do it for money.

406
00:34:32,000 --> 00:34:34,000
Does that make any sense? What I just said.

407
00:34:34,000 --> 00:34:51,000
Like, just because Star or I get paid from our videos doesn't necessarily mean we like do it

408
00:34:52,000 --> 00:34:53,000
to make money.

409
00:34:59,000 --> 00:35:00,000
Okay, look, there we go.

410
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:03,000
What is the boss of chapter two? I don't even remember.

411
00:35:08,000 --> 00:35:10,000
Oh, it's this guy. It's Chad. There he is.

412
00:35:10,000 --> 00:35:12,000
Hey, I did a chat.

413
00:35:13,000 --> 00:35:14,000
Oh, shit.

414
00:35:20,000 --> 00:35:22,000
Some of these bosses I do forget the pattern zone.

415
00:35:22,000 --> 00:35:24,000
So it's going to take me into your couple of different areas.

416
00:35:25,000 --> 00:35:27,000
It's going to take me like quite a few times, probably here.

417
00:35:29,000 --> 00:35:29,000
Shit.

418
00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:38,000
Oh, I got locked out of that one.

419
00:35:42,000 --> 00:35:45,000
Oh, you fucker.

420
00:35:50,000 --> 00:35:52,000
Damn it. It's going too fast.

421
00:35:56,000 --> 00:35:59,000
Can you, you know, there are no a fuss on boss. What am I doing?

422
00:36:01,000 --> 00:36:03,000
Oh, I already do it.

423
00:36:06,000 --> 00:36:08,000
Going for like eight pluses and they don't even exist.

424
00:36:13,000 --> 00:36:15,000
Oh, here. Okay.

425
00:36:16,000 --> 00:36:18,000
Is this going to be the first small wall that I hit?

426
00:36:31,000 --> 00:36:32,000
You fucking.

427
00:36:39,000 --> 00:36:41,000
Can I get up to the other side without having to do all that?

428
00:36:43,000 --> 00:36:44,000
I don't think I can.

429
00:36:47,000 --> 00:36:49,000
Oh, shit. I blew it already.

430
00:36:49,000 --> 00:36:50,000
Damn.

431
00:36:52,000 --> 00:36:53,000
First fast, I just did the first one.

432
00:36:53,000 --> 00:36:55,000
This is taking me a little longer.

433
00:37:01,000 --> 00:37:01,000
Just going to make it.

434
00:37:02,000 --> 00:37:03,000
I do that a lot in this game.

435
00:37:04,000 --> 00:37:04,000
I will say.

436
00:37:18,000 --> 00:37:18,000
Here we go.

437
00:37:26,000 --> 00:37:28,000
You know, this is used to talking about like needing a new game.

438
00:37:29,000 --> 00:37:29,000
I do too.

439
00:37:34,000 --> 00:37:35,000
I think a lot of people do it, right?

440
00:37:35,000 --> 00:37:36,000
Like it.

441
00:37:38,000 --> 00:37:39,000
You go through phases.

442
00:37:40,000 --> 00:37:46,000
Sometimes you go through phases where you are having a ton of fun playing a one particular game.

443
00:37:47,000 --> 00:37:48,000
And it's all you really care about.

444
00:37:48,000 --> 00:37:50,000
The only thing you want to do is the only thing you want to play.

445
00:37:52,000 --> 00:37:53,000
And then you're just like you need something else.

446
00:37:55,000 --> 00:37:56,000
I mean.

447
00:37:59,000 --> 00:38:02,000
There's no reason to rush into trying to find something that you are interested in.

448
00:38:05,000 --> 00:38:06,000
Yeah, I skipped that.

449
00:38:06,000 --> 00:38:08,000
I don't want to say I like I've put you in.

450
00:38:10,000 --> 00:38:12,000
All right, this is where the A pluses might start stopping.

451
00:38:16,000 --> 00:38:21,000
I can only guarantee A pluses on the first like two worlds really.

452
00:38:21,000 --> 00:38:22,000
Maybe three.

453
00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:24,000
Oh, shit.

454
00:38:29,000 --> 00:38:35,000
Oh, shawty.

455
00:38:40,000 --> 00:38:41,000
This one is.

456
00:38:42,000 --> 00:38:42,000
All right, I can do this one.

457
00:38:46,000 --> 00:38:46,000
Shit.

458
00:38:54,000 --> 00:38:55,000
Give me that key.

459
00:38:56,000 --> 00:38:57,000
I did a key.

460
00:38:59,000 --> 00:39:00,000
Yeah.

461
00:39:02,000 --> 00:39:04,000
Yeah, this is the chapter where people get really shawty.

462
00:39:07,000 --> 00:39:11,000
I wonder how many people like I'll have a good one stream this game and gotten really shawty.

463
00:39:11,000 --> 00:39:11,000
This part.

464
00:39:14,000 --> 00:39:14,000
Oh, like it.

465
00:39:14,000 --> 00:39:18,000
I can already feel my blood boilers getting a little shawty.

466
00:39:24,000 --> 00:39:25,000
No, just just get me.

467
00:39:29,000 --> 00:39:36,000
Oh, I thought that was going the other way.

468
00:39:39,000 --> 00:39:41,000
All right, you know, you know, well, I've said that I'm noticing.

469
00:39:41,000 --> 00:39:43,000
What's what's what's with the snake thing?

470
00:39:44,000 --> 00:39:48,000
As I've seen it all over twitch lately like people are like doing like snake noises in a

471
00:39:48,000 --> 00:39:48,000
shit.

472
00:39:48,000 --> 00:39:51,000
What's the what's the what is the snakes?

473
00:39:51,000 --> 00:39:53,000
Does everybody like keep pulling up to speed here with the internet stuff?

474
00:39:59,000 --> 00:39:59,000
Yeah.

475
00:40:04,000 --> 00:40:06,000
Yeah, see like that guy right there was just like his.

476
00:40:08,000 --> 00:40:10,000
Is like snakes like invading twitch TV?

477
00:40:17,000 --> 00:40:19,000
Oh, it's like a it's like a guy.

478
00:40:19,000 --> 00:40:27,000
Yeah, twitch has been invented by fucking snakes.

479
00:40:31,000 --> 00:40:32,000
Oh, geez, what have I done?

480
00:40:36,000 --> 00:40:40,000
Yeah, I just don't know where things originate sometimes.

481
00:40:50,000 --> 00:40:54,000
Yeah, this one's this one's not an a plus.

482
00:40:54,000 --> 00:40:56,000
I can tell you that right now.

483
00:40:57,000 --> 00:40:58,000
Okay, it is.

484
00:41:09,000 --> 00:41:10,000
You shouldn't have mentioned it.

485
00:41:10,000 --> 00:41:12,000
Well, I don't care.

486
00:41:14,000 --> 00:41:16,000
Like stuff like that doesn't really like doesn't like bother me.

487
00:41:17,000 --> 00:41:22,000
If you want to be like a fucking snake man on twitch or whatever like you know you do you

488
00:41:22,000 --> 00:41:23,000
did I get an a plus there?

489
00:41:28,000 --> 00:41:31,000
I did no I didn't I did not my did not.

490
00:41:35,000 --> 00:41:36,000
We gotta we gotta go fix that.

491
00:41:43,000 --> 00:41:44,000
We have to wait to fix that.

492
00:41:46,000 --> 00:41:47,000
We have to wait to fix that.

493
00:41:54,000 --> 00:41:54,000
Here we go wait to fix that.

494
00:42:10,000 --> 00:42:10,000
Anthana cake.

495
00:42:10,000 --> 00:42:17,000
I'm not gonna go all the way down on this one like that.

496
00:42:17,000 --> 00:42:21,000
No, not even like that.

497
00:42:21,000 --> 00:42:28,000
Alright, what the hell am I doing wrong here?

498
00:42:28,000 --> 00:42:32,000
Apparently that.

499
00:42:32,000 --> 00:42:39,000
I don't know why I thought that this level went down.

500
00:42:39,000 --> 00:42:42,000
I don't know why I'm trying to jump either.

501
00:42:42,000 --> 00:42:45,000
This is the- hey hey, this is part where the stream is get all salty.

502
00:42:45,000 --> 00:42:54,000
I've seen it before.

503
00:42:54,000 --> 00:43:01,000
Is jumping off of this jumping off that doesn't do anything, does it?

504
00:43:01,000 --> 00:43:03,000
Maybe it does.

505
00:43:03,000 --> 00:43:05,000
These mechanics are some of this shit.

506
00:43:05,000 --> 00:43:08,000
I don't even remember.

507
00:43:08,000 --> 00:43:19,000
There we go.

508
00:43:19,000 --> 00:43:26,000
Oh fuck.

509
00:43:27,000 --> 00:43:29,000
Yeah, this one's hurting my head.

510
00:43:29,000 --> 00:43:33,000
I like- you have to go all the way down with it.

511
00:43:33,000 --> 00:43:37,000
But- oh hey, no more A pluses guys.

512
00:43:37,000 --> 00:43:42,000
That's the end of the A plus run.

513
00:43:42,000 --> 00:43:47,000
No, I get it now.

514
00:43:47,000 --> 00:43:49,000
I'm just not hitting it at the right spot.

515
00:43:49,000 --> 00:43:54,000
I gotta go a little further down on it like here.

516
00:43:54,000 --> 00:43:55,000
Oh, wait a minute.

517
00:43:55,000 --> 00:43:56,000
Okay, there we go.

518
00:43:56,000 --> 00:44:00,000
You just have to touch the bottom.

519
00:44:00,000 --> 00:44:04,000
That's really how there is to it.

520
00:44:04,000 --> 00:44:11,000
I can just get a little bit salty, yeah guys.

521
00:44:11,000 --> 00:44:14,000
That- was it just a thing that just hit me right there?

522
00:44:14,000 --> 00:44:23,000
A little bit of fucking sly, a bit of potassium chloride.

523
00:44:23,000 --> 00:44:24,000
I'm just gonna go for a stream.

524
00:44:24,000 --> 00:44:33,000
I don't- what did I play on my first stream?

525
00:44:33,000 --> 00:44:43,000
Oh fucking shut up.

526
00:44:43,000 --> 00:44:50,000
Nope, this got me.

527
00:44:50,000 --> 00:44:51,000
This one was really good.

528
00:44:51,000 --> 00:44:52,000
I kind of blew it.

529
00:44:52,000 --> 00:44:56,000
I could have had it in the first one.

530
00:44:56,000 --> 00:45:04,000
Oh boy, oh boy, oh boy, oh boy.

531
00:45:04,000 --> 00:45:06,000
What did I do that first time?

532
00:45:06,000 --> 00:45:19,000
What the hell did I- what did I change that first time?

533
00:45:19,000 --> 00:45:23,000
Oh, what did I do?

534
00:45:23,000 --> 00:45:25,000
Alright, let me look, I was pinning into it.

535
00:45:25,000 --> 00:45:26,000
It was binding of Isaac, was it?

536
00:45:26,000 --> 00:45:27,000
He could have been.

537
00:45:27,000 --> 00:45:31,000
I could see that.

538
00:45:31,000 --> 00:45:37,000
Oh come on, hit the wall.

539
00:45:37,000 --> 00:45:43,000
We call that dog shit, guys.

540
00:45:43,000 --> 00:45:48,000
Hit the wall, you dog shit.

541
00:45:48,000 --> 00:46:04,000
That's a person that doesn't have a whole lot of like weathered vocabulary.

542
00:46:04,000 --> 00:46:08,000
I'm a linguist.

543
00:46:08,000 --> 00:46:17,000
I know my dictionary words.

544
00:46:17,000 --> 00:46:23,000
I hate these things.

545
00:46:23,000 --> 00:46:26,000
You want to know like, okay, so everybody has like the, the, the, the vein of their existence

546
00:46:26,000 --> 00:46:27,000
in me, boy.

547
00:46:27,000 --> 00:46:29,000
Mine are these stupid rockets.

548
00:46:29,000 --> 00:46:33,000
I fucking hate these rockets.

549
00:46:33,000 --> 00:46:35,000
Really messing with my A plus run.

550
00:46:35,000 --> 00:46:37,000
Really making me a little bit- what's that word?

551
00:46:37,000 --> 00:46:38,000
I forget it.

552
00:46:38,000 --> 00:46:39,000
You know, I'm not a linguist.

553
00:46:39,000 --> 00:46:42,000
What's that word?

554
00:46:42,000 --> 00:46:43,000
Like that, peppery.

555
00:46:43,000 --> 00:46:46,000
Little two peppery.

556
00:46:46,000 --> 00:46:52,000
Little two, you know, garlic powder.

557
00:46:52,000 --> 00:46:59,000
He's getting real garlic powdery.

558
00:46:59,000 --> 00:47:00,000
What am I doing?

559
00:47:00,000 --> 00:47:04,000
Fuck you.

560
00:47:04,000 --> 00:47:10,000
God.

561
00:47:10,000 --> 00:47:13,000
Down there please.

562
00:47:13,000 --> 00:47:14,000
I've got all day.

563
00:47:14,000 --> 00:47:15,000
We'll go.

564
00:47:15,000 --> 00:47:20,000
Okay.

565
00:47:20,000 --> 00:47:23,000
What?

566
00:47:23,000 --> 00:47:24,000
Ten.

567
00:47:24,000 --> 00:47:25,000
Huh?

568
00:47:25,000 --> 00:47:29,000
What was that?

569
00:47:29,000 --> 00:47:37,000
Maybe I should, I think I should just fall right down, right?

570
00:47:37,000 --> 00:47:38,000
Let's see.

571
00:47:38,000 --> 00:47:39,000
Yeah, I'm wasting too much time there.

572
00:47:39,000 --> 00:47:42,000
I gotta go straight down.

573
00:47:42,000 --> 00:47:48,000
Dude, is that vanilla extract?

574
00:47:48,000 --> 00:47:52,000
No, you dummy.

575
00:47:52,000 --> 00:47:57,000
Toot me, I can induce rage in anyone.

576
00:47:57,000 --> 00:48:03,000
Especially if you're trying to do all 100% A plus.

577
00:48:03,000 --> 00:48:07,000
There we go.

578
00:48:07,000 --> 00:48:16,000
Oh, I didn't register.

579
00:48:16,000 --> 00:48:17,000
Control is broken.

580
00:48:17,000 --> 00:48:24,000
Control is fucking broken.

581
00:48:24,000 --> 00:48:31,000
I gotta get my distance.

582
00:48:31,000 --> 00:48:33,000
I'm like, everyone's talking about this.

583
00:48:33,000 --> 00:48:36,000
Did you see that streamer rage on Super Meat Boy?

584
00:48:36,000 --> 00:48:37,000
It was so crazy.

585
00:48:37,000 --> 00:48:40,000
He threw his controller into the ground and it exploded.

586
00:48:40,000 --> 00:48:41,000
Oh my god, I can't.

587
00:48:41,000 --> 00:48:42,000
It's gonna be everywhere.

588
00:48:42,000 --> 00:48:43,000
Did you see that streamer?

589
00:48:43,000 --> 00:48:48,000
That was like really mad and rage.

590
00:48:48,000 --> 00:48:55,000
Fuck.

591
00:48:55,000 --> 00:49:05,000
I'm so into almost a guaranteed A plus.

592
00:49:05,000 --> 00:49:14,000
As long as you just write when that thing ends, you hit it.

593
00:49:14,000 --> 00:49:19,000
Burger Boy's sunny day is a video that will never be released.

594
00:49:19,000 --> 00:49:25,000
Whatever.

595
00:49:25,000 --> 00:49:27,000
Whoa, what the fuck happened there?

596
00:49:27,000 --> 00:49:32,000
That was odd.

597
00:49:32,000 --> 00:49:35,000
Can't you just bypass that?

598
00:49:35,000 --> 00:49:37,000
No, I guess you have to wait.

599
00:49:37,000 --> 00:49:39,000
I hate waiters.

600
00:49:39,000 --> 00:49:40,000
They come over.

601
00:49:40,000 --> 00:49:42,000
They try to take your order and ship.

602
00:49:42,000 --> 00:49:45,000
And you're like, excuse me, I'm here on a lunch date.

603
00:49:45,000 --> 00:49:47,000
Come back later.

604
00:49:47,000 --> 00:49:50,000
But please bring more bread.

605
00:49:50,000 --> 00:49:52,000
Idiot.

606
00:49:52,000 --> 00:49:58,000
He gives you that waiter look, you know, the like.

607
00:49:58,000 --> 00:50:01,000
I don't even refill your Coke.

608
00:50:01,000 --> 00:50:04,000
I don't even refill your Pepsi in shit.

609
00:50:04,000 --> 00:50:09,000
Where are you?

610
00:50:09,000 --> 00:50:11,000
I'm doing this one wrong for the A plus.

611
00:50:11,000 --> 00:50:13,000
I gotta go on the other side, I think.

612
00:50:13,000 --> 00:50:16,000
Like over here.

613
00:50:16,000 --> 00:50:21,000
Far too much fucking mouth.

614
00:50:21,000 --> 00:50:30,000
He's still got it.

615
00:50:30,000 --> 00:50:40,000
No, I hate that.

616
00:50:40,000 --> 00:50:42,000
I hate that.

617
00:50:42,000 --> 00:50:45,000
Why must it do that sometimes to me?

618
00:50:45,000 --> 00:50:50,000
Oops.

619
00:50:50,000 --> 00:50:53,000
Don't you guys see that whiny, whiny streamer like that?

620
00:50:53,000 --> 00:50:55,000
I don't hate that whiny streamer.

621
00:50:55,000 --> 00:50:56,000
I can play Super Meat Boy.

622
00:50:56,000 --> 00:51:03,000
What a whiner.

623
00:51:03,000 --> 00:51:08,000
It's gonna be on the front page of our slash winers.

624
00:51:08,000 --> 00:51:15,000
Let me through.

625
00:51:15,000 --> 00:51:32,000
No, it did it again, whiner.

626
00:51:32,000 --> 00:51:33,000
Rip it.

627
00:51:33,000 --> 00:51:37,000
Barg, we got frogs taking over now.

628
00:51:37,000 --> 00:51:44,000
Guys, I don't want to be a, you know, a widow about this, but frogs.

629
00:51:44,000 --> 00:51:46,000
I mean, come on, let me take over.

630
00:51:46,000 --> 00:51:51,000
Frogs wanted to take over, which, which, I think I'd be okay with frogs.

631
00:51:51,000 --> 00:52:00,000
I mean, who really, who wouldn't be okay with a frog taking over, but...

632
00:52:00,000 --> 00:52:06,000
Especially if they were giant bull frogs.

633
00:52:06,000 --> 00:52:13,000
Ah, shit.

634
00:52:13,000 --> 00:52:14,000
Oh, you dumber.

635
00:52:14,000 --> 00:52:15,000
Dumber.

636
00:52:15,000 --> 00:52:30,000
I'm gonna be making up a random insults for myself this whole time, so I apologize about that.

637
00:52:30,000 --> 00:52:34,000
Unclog the frog, permit the curve.

638
00:52:34,000 --> 00:52:39,000
I've never heard of these before.

639
00:52:39,000 --> 00:52:41,000
Hey guys, look up where I at.

640
00:52:41,000 --> 00:52:45,000
My least favorite thing in this whole game.

641
00:52:45,000 --> 00:52:54,000
Our slash, slash, slash, whiner.

642
00:52:54,000 --> 00:52:57,000
Ooh, I blew it.

643
00:52:57,000 --> 00:53:03,000
Look at how much I just blew that.

644
00:53:03,000 --> 00:53:10,000
You blew it, you know.

645
00:53:10,000 --> 00:53:17,000
Ah.

646
00:53:17,000 --> 00:53:27,000
This is where my A plus streak ends.

647
00:53:27,000 --> 00:53:29,000
Now, you know, I thought about it.

648
00:53:29,000 --> 00:53:30,000
I thought I was gonna end.

649
00:53:30,000 --> 00:53:31,000
It's going to end.

650
00:53:31,000 --> 00:53:33,000
Let's just put that way.

651
00:53:33,000 --> 00:53:37,000
I don't know when, but it will.

652
00:53:37,000 --> 00:53:46,000
Maybe around like World 4 or something.

653
00:53:46,000 --> 00:53:49,000
Oh, shit.

654
00:53:49,000 --> 00:53:53,000
Oh, god, god, god, god, god.

655
00:53:53,000 --> 00:53:59,000
God, god, god.

656
00:53:59,000 --> 00:54:04,000
You know, I don't want to get myself angry here and say this is a shot with snow level.

657
00:54:04,000 --> 00:54:06,000
You know, I don't be mad about everyone else.

658
00:54:06,000 --> 00:54:08,000
Angry streamers.

659
00:54:08,000 --> 00:54:11,000
They get on the front page.

660
00:54:11,000 --> 00:54:18,000
Alright, I'd like that way too much and he'd like stop doing that.

661
00:54:18,000 --> 00:54:29,000
Hey, look, all A pluses did it.

662
00:54:29,000 --> 00:54:32,000
Hooray, let's beat the snowman.

663
00:54:32,000 --> 00:54:33,000
Skip.

664
00:54:33,000 --> 00:54:36,000
Oh, this is the race.

665
00:54:36,000 --> 00:54:38,000
Am I crazy?

666
00:54:38,000 --> 00:54:39,000
Hold on, am I insane?

667
00:54:39,000 --> 00:54:47,000
Or did he just go way faster than he's supposed to?

668
00:54:47,000 --> 00:54:50,000
Am I crazy, right?

669
00:54:50,000 --> 00:54:53,000
I can't be crazy.

670
00:54:53,000 --> 00:54:55,000
I thought you were supposed to race this guy.

671
00:54:55,000 --> 00:54:59,000
He's already done.

672
00:54:59,000 --> 00:55:03,000
What?

673
00:55:03,000 --> 00:55:05,000
Look, what the fuck is this guy doing?

674
00:55:05,000 --> 00:55:06,000
He's coming so fast.

675
00:55:06,000 --> 00:55:12,000
He's like times two speed.

676
00:55:12,000 --> 00:55:19,000
I'm the guy who was supposed to beat him.

677
00:55:19,000 --> 00:55:27,000
Is he going to get stuck at the end or something?

678
00:55:27,000 --> 00:55:28,000
That's not fair.

679
00:55:28,000 --> 00:55:34,000
Where's my like, drugs to take to go that fast?

680
00:55:34,000 --> 00:55:41,000
I beat him.

681
00:55:41,000 --> 00:55:45,000
I'll take it.

682
00:55:45,000 --> 00:55:52,000
I'll take it.

683
00:55:52,000 --> 00:56:03,000
On to chapter four, I guess.

684
00:56:03,000 --> 00:56:06,000
Has anybody ever seen that before?

685
00:56:06,000 --> 00:56:15,000
Because I didn't like the three or four times that I've played or watched people play that part.

686
00:56:15,000 --> 00:56:20,000
I've probably seen that done a lot.

687
00:56:20,000 --> 00:56:29,000
I'm just going to pretend like I beat that fair and square.

688
00:56:29,000 --> 00:56:31,000
But we're not going for warp zones.

689
00:56:31,000 --> 00:56:33,000
We're not going for all A plus.

690
00:56:33,000 --> 00:56:35,000
As fast as possible.

691
00:56:35,000 --> 00:56:38,000
I've got my splits here.

692
00:56:38,000 --> 00:56:47,000
And I am on world record pace.

693
00:56:47,000 --> 00:56:50,000
That right.

694
00:56:50,000 --> 00:56:52,000
We're going up there.

695
00:56:52,000 --> 00:56:58,000
Why am I going up there?

696
00:56:58,000 --> 00:57:05,000
No, no, no, no, you're going to go on it.

697
00:57:05,000 --> 00:57:06,000
Shit.

698
00:57:06,000 --> 00:57:09,000
Need more speed.

699
00:57:09,000 --> 00:57:17,000
Is it where the A plus is stopped?

700
00:57:17,000 --> 00:57:22,000
Just kidding.

701
00:57:22,000 --> 00:57:29,000
I love that terminology.

702
00:57:29,000 --> 00:57:32,000
I hate fuck.

703
00:57:32,000 --> 00:57:41,000
Bring me my co-creep.

704
00:57:41,000 --> 00:57:44,000
I got to impatient.

705
00:57:44,000 --> 00:57:47,000
But that is how you're supposed to beat that.

706
00:57:47,000 --> 00:58:10,000
I need to just make that jump.

707
00:58:10,000 --> 00:58:15,000
This is a floater.

708
00:58:15,000 --> 00:58:19,000
Oh, this is one of those floaters.

709
00:58:19,000 --> 00:58:28,000
Still got it.

710
00:58:28,000 --> 00:58:34,000
Did that incorrectly?

711
00:58:34,000 --> 00:58:38,000
I did it correctly at the beginning.

712
00:58:38,000 --> 00:58:41,000
But then the fire guy hit me.

713
00:58:41,000 --> 00:58:48,000
I'm going to go.

714
00:58:48,000 --> 00:58:55,000
Ah!

715
00:58:55,000 --> 00:59:01,000
Oh my goodness.

716
00:59:01,000 --> 00:59:10,000
Oh my god, wait.

717
00:59:10,000 --> 00:59:14,000
I'm going to have to wait for a waiter.

718
00:59:14,000 --> 00:59:17,000
You know how fast I want to go?

719
00:59:17,000 --> 00:59:21,000
I don't want to have to wait for this shit.

720
00:59:21,000 --> 00:59:25,000
Now it's getting in my head.

721
00:59:25,000 --> 00:59:32,000
Always the damn waiter levels.

722
00:59:32,000 --> 00:59:36,000
I just did the thing where I turned my neck sideways

723
00:59:36,000 --> 00:59:43,000
and I'm getting mad.

724
00:59:43,000 --> 00:59:58,000
It's a waiting level.

725
00:59:58,000 --> 01:00:01,000
What is happening to my voice?

726
01:00:01,000 --> 01:00:06,000
Oh.

727
01:00:06,000 --> 01:00:10,000
If it's a waiter level, it's going to be an A plus

728
01:00:10,000 --> 01:00:14,000
as long as you get there by the time the platform has to be there.

729
01:00:14,000 --> 01:00:15,000
That's how those work.

730
01:00:15,000 --> 01:00:18,000
So I don't need to rush it.

731
01:00:18,000 --> 01:00:20,000
Like this one.

732
01:00:20,000 --> 01:00:27,000
Just going to stand here.

733
01:00:27,000 --> 01:00:34,000
I got to get some more bacon and eggs in me.

734
01:00:34,000 --> 01:00:41,000
Why did I think that that was going to work?

735
01:00:41,000 --> 01:00:54,000
Damn it.

736
01:00:54,000 --> 01:00:57,000
Now I slipped the helmet.

737
01:00:57,000 --> 01:01:04,000
How many seconds do I need to shave off of that?

738
01:01:04,000 --> 01:01:05,000
A huge amount.

739
01:01:05,000 --> 01:01:21,000
An absolutely massive amount of time has to be shaved off of it.

740
01:01:21,000 --> 01:01:27,000
That's got to be right there.

741
01:01:27,000 --> 01:01:31,000
Can I do that though?

742
01:01:31,000 --> 01:01:35,000
Maybe it's not.

743
01:01:35,000 --> 01:01:42,000
Let me shave like three full seconds off.

744
01:01:42,000 --> 01:01:48,000
Oh, yeah, I could shave seconds out there.

745
01:01:48,000 --> 01:01:51,000
I thought you were switching games after World 2.

746
01:01:51,000 --> 01:01:54,000
I was.

747
01:01:54,000 --> 01:02:00,000
Once I stop reliably getting A pluses within like 10 to 20 attempts on a level,

748
01:02:00,000 --> 01:02:08,000
that's when we're going to switch game.

749
01:02:08,000 --> 01:02:10,000
Oh, shit.

750
01:02:10,000 --> 01:02:16,000
I fucked that up.

751
01:02:16,000 --> 01:02:17,000
Shit.

752
01:02:17,000 --> 01:02:18,000
I fucked that up again.

753
01:02:18,000 --> 01:02:19,000
I'll hold on a bit.

754
01:02:19,000 --> 01:02:20,000
Shit.

755
01:02:20,000 --> 01:02:26,000
I fucked that up again.

756
01:02:26,000 --> 01:02:37,000
Oh, shit.

757
01:02:37,000 --> 01:02:43,000
Oh, that jump.

758
01:02:43,000 --> 01:02:45,000
Good morning.

759
01:02:45,000 --> 01:02:48,000
Need more speed.

760
01:02:48,000 --> 01:02:53,000
You always need more speed in V4.

761
01:02:53,000 --> 01:02:55,000
I should have grabbed onto the wall.

762
01:02:55,000 --> 01:02:59,000
That was a mistake.

763
01:02:59,000 --> 01:03:01,000
No, I went too fast that time.

764
01:03:01,000 --> 01:03:12,000
I'm not gonna have fast enough.

765
01:03:12,000 --> 01:03:14,000
I gotta get up there when I'm doing two jumps.

766
01:03:14,000 --> 01:03:15,000
That's really important.

767
01:03:15,000 --> 01:03:17,000
That has to happen.

768
01:03:17,000 --> 01:03:23,000
Well, that was like four jumps.

769
01:03:23,000 --> 01:03:26,000
Is there a meeple-drinking game?

770
01:03:26,000 --> 01:03:28,000
Probably.

771
01:03:28,000 --> 01:03:30,000
Oh, that was it too.

772
01:03:30,000 --> 01:03:32,000
I just was too psycho about it.

773
01:03:32,000 --> 01:03:34,000
Am I going to watch the Overwatch beta stream?

774
01:03:34,000 --> 01:03:36,000
Holy shit, yeah.

775
01:03:36,000 --> 01:03:39,000
I can't wait for that.

776
01:03:39,000 --> 01:03:42,000
I just want to play the game again, man.

777
01:03:42,000 --> 01:03:53,000
I just want to play Overwatch again.

778
01:03:53,000 --> 01:03:54,000
That's so easy to get.

779
01:03:54,000 --> 01:04:04,000
I like half to just get it.

780
01:04:04,000 --> 01:04:05,000
I'll get it.

781
01:04:05,000 --> 01:04:06,000
Just hold on.

782
01:04:06,000 --> 01:04:07,000
I never chill out.

783
01:04:07,000 --> 01:04:09,000
Everybody gets chill out.

784
01:04:09,000 --> 01:04:11,000
Yeah, you missed it.

785
01:04:11,000 --> 01:04:15,000
I better not see any yellow bells in that chat.

786
01:04:15,000 --> 01:04:32,000
If I missed this again, I swear to God, if I see a fucking goddamn yellow bell.

787
01:04:32,000 --> 01:04:34,000
Fuck the band-aid.

788
01:04:34,000 --> 01:04:43,000
Let's go.

789
01:04:43,000 --> 01:04:46,000
I'm seeing the yellow bells in the chat.

790
01:04:46,000 --> 01:04:49,000
Unbelievable.

791
01:04:49,000 --> 01:04:52,000
Unbelievable.

792
01:04:52,000 --> 01:04:55,000
Oh, I forget how you did this one.

793
01:05:03,000 --> 01:05:06,000
Pick it up. Pick up the...

794
01:05:06,000 --> 01:05:08,000
See if I did that right.

795
01:05:08,000 --> 01:05:13,000
That would have been fine.

796
01:05:13,000 --> 01:05:23,000
Yeah, I didn't even get it.

797
01:05:23,000 --> 01:05:24,000
You got it.

798
01:05:24,000 --> 01:05:27,000
You get it.

799
01:05:27,000 --> 01:05:29,000
Angry streamer.

800
01:05:29,000 --> 01:05:32,000
You guys are so angry.

801
01:05:32,000 --> 01:05:48,000
Somebody get this guy like a towel to wipe the sweat off of his forehead.

802
01:05:48,000 --> 01:05:58,000
Oh, fuck.

803
01:05:58,000 --> 01:05:59,000
Did it again.

804
01:05:59,000 --> 01:06:02,000
Hey, look what's in this level, guys.

805
01:06:02,000 --> 01:06:03,000
What is that?

806
01:06:03,000 --> 01:06:04,000
What is that platform?

807
01:06:04,000 --> 01:06:05,000
What is that platform?

808
01:06:05,000 --> 01:06:06,000
What am I doing?

809
01:06:06,000 --> 01:06:07,000
I'm waiting.

810
01:06:07,000 --> 01:06:13,000
And then I get all thrown off, and I can't do the next part.

811
01:06:13,000 --> 01:06:16,000
Waiter, remember the check.

812
01:06:16,000 --> 01:06:19,000
I'm going to fucking McDonald's.

813
01:06:19,000 --> 01:06:27,000
What's this dog food that you are serving us?

814
01:06:28,000 --> 01:06:33,000
Well, that's what that did.

815
01:06:33,000 --> 01:06:36,000
Well, that's what that did.

816
01:06:50,000 --> 01:06:52,000
I'm going to get a coffee soon.

817
01:06:52,000 --> 01:06:54,000
I could add, you know, I got a coffee already.

818
01:06:54,000 --> 01:06:55,000
I'm good, man.

819
01:06:55,000 --> 01:06:56,000
Appreciate it, though.

820
01:06:58,000 --> 01:06:59,000
Appreciate the offer.

821
01:07:04,000 --> 01:07:05,000
Shit.

822
01:07:13,000 --> 01:07:14,000
Ah.

823
01:07:22,000 --> 01:07:23,000
Fuck.

824
01:07:24,000 --> 01:07:28,000
I think I'm doing something a little bit wrong.

825
01:07:28,000 --> 01:07:30,000
What am I doing wrong, though?

826
01:07:30,000 --> 01:07:33,000
You have to go super fast.

827
01:07:38,000 --> 01:07:43,000
Now, no, no, I'm taking too much time to do it.

828
01:07:48,000 --> 01:07:50,000
I'm getting ready for school.

829
01:07:51,000 --> 01:07:52,000
Come on.

830
01:07:52,000 --> 01:07:54,000
Make sure you're not late.

831
01:07:54,000 --> 01:07:57,000
I don't want to, I don't want you to have watched this movie

832
01:07:57,000 --> 01:07:59,000
like late to go to school.

833
01:08:02,000 --> 01:08:03,000
No, whoops.

834
01:08:03,000 --> 01:08:07,000
I just like ran over the whole thing.

835
01:08:07,000 --> 01:08:09,000
Sorry, me, I just want you to do the jump.

836
01:08:09,000 --> 01:08:11,000
You don't want to land on that thing.

837
01:08:11,000 --> 01:08:12,000
Try to remember.

838
01:08:16,000 --> 01:08:18,000
I'm not going fast enough.

839
01:08:20,000 --> 01:08:21,000
Stop.

840
01:08:30,000 --> 01:08:31,000
Wendy's Big Mac.

841
01:08:31,000 --> 01:08:32,000
Wendee's Big Mac.

842
01:08:32,000 --> 01:08:33,000
Pick Doublemaker.

843
01:08:33,000 --> 01:08:35,000
What, Wendy's, what?

844
01:08:35,000 --> 01:08:37,000
You don't wanna, Wendy's Big Mac.

01:13:44,000 --> 01:13:49,000

01:13:49,000 --> 01:13:52,000

01:14:07,000 --> 01:14:09,000
I

881
01:14:13,000 --> 01:14:15,000

889
01:15:19,000 --> 01:15:20,000
it's like the hardest level in the whole game

890
01:15:32,000 --> 01:15:38,000
okay let's let's like continue let me like it at an A plus right now

891
01:15:42,000 --> 01:15:44,000
much we get this A plus

892
01:15:50,000 --> 01:15:52,000
much right here this is gonna be watch this A plus guys here it comes

893
01:16:02,000 --> 01:16:05,000
I just actually like forgot what that what I got I didn't I didn't even know what that level just did

894
01:16:12,000 --> 01:16:14,000
fucking dumbass saw blades

895
01:16:21,000 --> 01:16:23,000
I'm not gonna take nearly as many tries

896
01:16:28,000 --> 01:16:29,000
what just happened

897
01:16:31,000 --> 01:16:36,000
all right we're changing games after this I'm about to flip out you want to see somebody freak out

898
01:16:37,000 --> 01:16:39,000
all god it was a freak out

899
01:16:50,000 --> 01:16:52,000
fucking waiter level

900
01:16:53,000 --> 01:17:03,000
at least I'm gonna beat the waiter level in the first try oh dear fuck

901
01:17:05,000 --> 01:17:07,000
that's what I give opening my mouth

902
01:17:23,000 --> 01:17:23,000
okay

903
01:17:46,000 --> 01:17:49,000
first try those dodges

904
01:17:53,000 --> 01:17:58,000
okay let's let's remember what the level is before we try to do it

905
01:18:03,000 --> 01:18:10,000
okay this is another part that this one too is in there if I remember correctly

906
01:18:15,000 --> 01:18:16,000
uh well I

907
01:18:16,000 --> 01:18:18,000
I

908
01:18:19,000 --> 01:18:23,000
I just getting confused can't do this one fast what's the timer on this one

909
01:18:26,000 --> 01:18:33,000
I bet if this one's probably like a minute no 22 seconds this is not like an 8 second one

910
01:18:33,000 --> 01:18:45,000
just getting stuck on walls you sticky skinless fuck

911
01:18:56,000 --> 01:18:58,000
should I be able to jump from that or miss him's hitting the top of the wall

912
01:19:03,000 --> 01:19:08,000
oh no there that goes

913
01:19:16,000 --> 01:19:19,000
probably jump underneath those two and just not doing it whoa I fell off

914
01:19:19,000 --> 01:19:21,000
yeah

915
01:19:29,000 --> 01:19:31,000
I guess I do now you just gotta go

916
01:19:33,000 --> 01:19:36,000
all right now I know you can jump underneath them now I wasn't doing that before

917
01:19:50,000 --> 01:19:56,000
all right I'm switching to crib talk after this I know this is never gonna end well for me

918
01:19:58,000 --> 01:20:03,000
I'm just gonna get so mad and I'm gonna start like apt I'm gonna start breaking things in this room

919
01:20:03,000 --> 01:20:05,000
I'm just gonna start swinging around in circles

920
01:20:09,000 --> 01:20:10,000
no I'm not doing this one right

921
01:20:15,000 --> 01:20:17,000
wait a minute am I going too fast

922
01:20:20,000 --> 01:20:23,000
I think I'm just going too fast to be able to like complete this one

923
01:20:32,000 --> 01:20:32,000
let's see

924
01:20:36,000 --> 01:20:37,000
let's find out

925
01:20:42,000 --> 01:20:44,000
yeah I think I have to like wait longer don't I

926
01:20:45,000 --> 01:20:50,000
well I'll just wait till these go over the top of this then

927
01:20:52,000 --> 01:20:59,000
yeah huh well shit that's not cool

928
01:21:05,000 --> 01:21:12,000
maybe what another cycle like one two that would be one cycle there right

929
01:21:15,000 --> 01:21:25,000
no I know that that was bear that was not a full cycle that was like a half cycle

930
01:21:29,000 --> 01:21:34,000
one two no I'm gonna wait again

931
01:21:35,000 --> 01:21:36,000
one

932
01:21:42,000 --> 01:21:46,000
one two three

933
01:21:51,000 --> 01:21:53,000
fucking have to wait around

934
01:21:53,000 --> 01:21:55,000
I

935
01:22:03,000 --> 01:22:09,000
feel like that's not correct I think you just have to go faster through this

936
01:22:11,000 --> 01:22:15,000
not this one in particular but the other one like right when I get in here

937
01:22:15,000 --> 01:22:23,000
yeah yeah yeah I had it all wrong you kidding me right now you have to be

938
01:22:23,000 --> 01:22:29,000
kidding me give me like one second of teleport immunity please

939
01:22:39,000 --> 01:22:42,000
can I please get that like half second of teleport immunity

940
01:22:46,000 --> 01:22:53,000
what a pain in the dick

941
01:22:56,000 --> 01:22:59,000
that is such a pain in the balls it really is

942
01:23:04,000 --> 01:23:08,000
if only there was like a quarter of a tenth of a second of teleportation immunity

943
01:23:09,000 --> 01:23:10,000
that shit wouldn't happen

944
01:23:15,000 --> 01:23:21,000
all right get it

945
01:23:25,000 --> 01:23:26,000
look at all those me boys

946
01:23:32,000 --> 01:23:34,000
all right let's go

947
01:23:37,000 --> 01:23:39,000
don't kill me please don't kill me please don't kill me

948
01:23:39,000 --> 01:23:44,000
oh right I forgot he does that yes he does that

949
01:23:48,000 --> 01:23:51,000
this is a pattern I have to rememorize

950
01:23:54,000 --> 01:23:55,000
is it again on the other side

951
01:23:58,000 --> 01:23:59,000
oh that's not

952
01:24:05,000 --> 01:24:06,000
bang

953
01:24:09,000 --> 01:24:13,000
and then he goes crazy it hits like a couple times oh fuck can I use

954
01:24:13,000 --> 01:24:13,000
smashers his face

955
01:24:22,000 --> 01:24:26,000
smash your face down and then he does like one two three four with his fist right

956
01:24:29,000 --> 01:24:33,000
it's like left left middle middle or something left right middle middle

957
01:24:33,000 --> 01:24:39,000
yeah left right and then he goes in the middle and then he does it again

958
01:24:45,000 --> 01:24:51,000
wait too early but it's okay first jorma stream welcome how you doing man

959
01:24:54,000 --> 01:24:56,000
it's an easy pattern you have to jump three times you know those are the

960
01:24:56,000 --> 01:25:00,000
same but yeah I just I just have never it's been like a year so oh my god I'm too busy looking

961
01:25:00,000 --> 01:25:04,000
and talking and not even paying attention

962
01:25:07,000 --> 01:25:10,000
the last time I played this game was last time you watched me play it on my youtube

963
01:25:10,000 --> 01:25:13,000
channel three years ago

964
01:25:18,000 --> 01:25:21,000
do it go ahead

965
01:25:22,000 --> 01:25:28,000
and then again side is left

966
01:25:30,000 --> 01:25:33,000
till the right I know this smashers face again

967
01:25:43,000 --> 01:25:48,000
fuck oh it's so easy but you just have to memorize it

968
01:25:48,000 --> 01:25:51,000
trial and error memorization

969
01:26:01,000 --> 01:26:04,000
I was just on such a stupid spot

970
01:26:04,000 --> 01:26:06,000
oh

971
01:26:13,000 --> 01:26:18,000
bad please drop the fire right in the middle where I want to stand it'll be great

972
01:26:19,000 --> 01:26:20,000
no there you go thanks thank you do it it

973
01:26:22,000 --> 01:26:23,000
you're dingus

974
01:26:29,000 --> 01:26:33,000
oh oh I thought he smashed his face he smashed his face up to doing one

975
01:26:33,000 --> 01:26:35,000
time

976
01:26:39,000 --> 01:26:43,000
well we're I'm gonna change the cryptarch after this because this is like there's two more chapters

977
01:26:43,000 --> 01:26:49,000
after this but you know I kind of want to switch

978
01:26:55,000 --> 01:26:58,000
that seriously which is sitting there just blanking

979
01:26:58,000 --> 01:27:07,000
I was sitting there just like zoned out I was thinking about like breakfast sausage

980
01:27:09,000 --> 01:27:12,000
I honestly was sitting there going you know you know what's gonna be really I'm gonna have to like

981
01:27:12,000 --> 01:27:17,000
breakfast sausages I don't even need to move

982
01:27:17,000 --> 01:27:30,000
nice matches his face again right now don't pay stop paying attention to the sausages

983
01:27:30,000 --> 01:27:34,000
and pay attention to the game I think this is a safe spot

984
01:27:39,000 --> 01:27:44,000
which hand comes down I forget what's that one oh my god he does it two times in a row

985
01:27:47,000 --> 01:27:50,000
I fucking memorizing shit

986
01:27:56,000 --> 01:28:01,000
Jimmy Dean breakfast sausage and that's sound like good right now other than like

987
01:28:01,000 --> 01:28:04,000
rememorizing a boss fight in a meat boy that you haven't done it three years

988
01:28:04,000 --> 01:28:16,000
go for it

989
01:28:26,000 --> 01:28:27,000
I might be in some trouble here

990
01:28:28,000 --> 01:28:34,000
do it again

991
01:28:37,000 --> 01:28:47,000
oh why am I moving I don't need to move I didn't need to move there I just don't I just like

992
01:28:47,000 --> 01:28:56,000
don't care at all about this right now I always hated this boss I hate this boss because

993
01:28:56,000 --> 01:29:04,000
it's so slow and you just have to sit here and like you just get bored and by the time you

994
01:29:04,000 --> 01:29:07,000
know what he's doing

995
01:29:11,000 --> 01:29:18,000
now I'm just like why is he a big a meat boy to me that's not fair I want to be the big one

996
01:29:18,000 --> 01:29:20,000
yeah

997
01:29:24,000 --> 01:29:24,000
do it again

998
01:29:27,000 --> 01:29:32,000
smash your fucking head again please end the end thank you

999
01:29:38,000 --> 01:29:38,000
all right

1000
01:29:39,000 --> 01:29:54,000
I gotta use the force the rapture size doesn't matter this is one more

1001
01:29:54,000 --> 01:29:58,000
rapture the end I don't remember

1002
01:30:02,000 --> 01:30:04,000
we're gonna get we're just gonna get an A plus on this first one we're gonna do it with

1003
01:30:04,000 --> 01:30:12,000
commander video that that that's how I get my gamer license back I have to A plus one of these

1004
01:30:12,000 --> 01:30:23,000
levels with with commander video that's that's not gonna be an A plus in fact I think some of

1005
01:30:23,000 --> 01:30:29,000
these video some of these videos some of these videos some of these I think are not possible to

1006
01:30:29,000 --> 01:30:34,000
beat with commander video because he doesn't go fast enough let's see

1007
01:30:40,000 --> 01:30:42,000
why am I forgetting how to do this

1008
01:30:59,000 --> 01:31:00,000
22 seconds how long is that

1009
01:31:05,000 --> 01:31:09,000
how slow am I moving with this guy oh it was right there that was that that was the issue

1010
01:31:11,000 --> 01:31:15,000
get that right the first time and I'll have it yeah definitely let's do that again

1011
01:31:17,000 --> 01:31:18,000
give commander video

1012
01:31:21,000 --> 01:31:26,000
I can go I guess I don't think I've ever unlocked the 70 plus characters

1013
01:31:29,000 --> 01:31:35,000
I was a little sloppy but whatever yeah I'm gonna start over that was sloppy

1014
01:31:39,000 --> 01:31:42,000
oh whoops it is hey

1015
01:31:42,000 --> 01:31:44,000
I

1016
01:31:50,000 --> 01:31:52,000
wanted to grab and jump not float

1017
01:32:00,000 --> 01:32:05,000
fucking gonna crush up fucking glass and put it in my cereal

1018
01:32:05,000 --> 01:32:14,000
actually you know I probably see that with me boy is like the easiest jump you could ever do

1019
01:32:14,000 --> 01:32:15,000
you just go right through it

1020
01:32:16,000 --> 01:32:18,000
oh

1021
01:32:30,000 --> 01:32:36,000
commander video oh my god what am I doing just do three of those I got it

1022
01:32:46,000 --> 01:32:47,000
oh

1023
01:32:51,000 --> 01:32:53,000
dog

1024
01:33:04,000 --> 01:33:07,000
gotta go gotta go gotta go right now gotta go gotta go I didn't do that

1025
01:33:08,000 --> 01:33:13,000
like a name like 10 things you didn't want to do in your life floating right there as commander

1026
01:33:13,000 --> 01:33:18,000
video is one of them trying to go too fast

1027
01:33:24,000 --> 01:33:25,000
too slow

1028
01:33:30,000 --> 01:33:34,000
I remember when I played this game the first time just trying just trying to beat these level up

1029
01:33:34,000 --> 01:33:39,000
still too slow but how why am I still that slow right now I haven't nothing has changed

1030
01:33:39,000 --> 01:33:45,000
I'm still getting this one oh come on please

1031
01:33:49,000 --> 01:33:55,000
apparently you didn't want to float that time what the fuck are you doing commander video please

1032
01:33:55,000 --> 01:33:57,000
and all that is sacred what the fuck are you doing

1033
01:34:09,000 --> 01:34:16,000
go don't float this time

1034
01:34:22,000 --> 01:34:27,000
I what I had it I thought I was gonna miss the time I really did I really truly did

1035
01:34:30,000 --> 01:34:34,000
I honestly thought I was gonna get it I was gonna I was definitely gonna make the time though

1036
01:34:35,000 --> 01:34:42,000
so it'll happen it'll happen right now I had like three extra seconds I thought I'd only like one

1037
01:34:49,000 --> 01:34:53,000
yay I can't believe you've done this

1038
01:34:58,000 --> 01:35:02,000
all right last I definitely matter what happens here is the final thing I'm doing last time

1039
01:35:05,000 --> 01:35:09,000
after this like this is the last thing no matter what happens is the last life

1040
01:35:23,000 --> 01:35:31,000
all right do I get but I a plus to every meat boy is level into the into rapture and I want to play

1041
01:35:31,000 --> 01:35:40,000
kryptark do I have my learners permit back do I get to do I get to do the actual like the

1042
01:35:40,000 --> 01:35:50,000
driving test in like a week or two you said last one a whole chapter ago

1043
01:35:53,000 --> 01:35:57,000
what kind of freak is even up at this hour for any purpose other than eating sausage that's a good

1044
01:35:57,000 --> 01:36:05,000
question that's a really good question change my stream title

1045
01:36:08,000 --> 01:36:13,000
to rip dark

1046
01:36:13,000 --> 01:36:26,000
that's a lot of kryptark

1047
01:36:35,000 --> 01:36:38,000
set up a straw poll for what

1048
01:36:44,000 --> 01:36:52,000
what are we what are we doing a straw poll for for that's what we're doing is what we don't

1049
01:36:59,000 --> 01:37:04,000
it's really a carry rebirth run now that I did that's why we get we have to get our gaming license back

1050
01:37:04,000 --> 01:37:06,000
for

1051
01:37:12,000 --> 01:37:16,000
permit the current I got my I got my current learners permit

1052
01:37:21,000 --> 01:37:29,000
let me get let me get kryptark open

1053
01:37:34,000 --> 01:37:38,000
let's go ahead and open that

1054
01:37:41,000 --> 01:37:44,000
so I got to the I got to the I got to the kryptark I got to the end of this game

1055
01:37:45,000 --> 01:37:54,000
and I got a really really crazy awful generation and I lost but I'm just chilling I'm just

1056
01:37:54,000 --> 01:37:57,000
gonna do dumb builds I don't even care if I lose or not

1057
01:37:57,000 --> 01:38:05,000
you might even try the controller to to test it out and see how it is

1058
01:38:08,000 --> 01:38:11,000
what the fuck was that what are these weird animals

1059
01:38:16,000 --> 01:38:19,000
it's like animals always like outside making like weird noises

1060
01:38:19,000 --> 01:38:21,000
yeah

1061
01:38:23,000 --> 01:38:27,000
hold on a second I need to like see what like turkey or something is outside of her back

1062
01:40:19,000 --> 01:40:23,000
yeah that was where I heard a bunch of like weird animal noises outside I've been

1063
01:40:23,000 --> 01:40:28,000
not here there's a lot here and then I wouldn't got my dog

1064
01:40:36,000 --> 01:40:41,000
let's change it to this let's play kryptark

1065
01:40:41,000 --> 01:40:49,000
it's cap is shit out of germa what what

1066
01:40:53,000 --> 01:41:04,000
cap of him get him like let's get him cap of him I don't I don't get it you're gonna cap

1067
01:41:04,000 --> 01:41:07,000
of me why would you do such a thing

1068
01:41:10,000 --> 01:41:11,000
we're gonna do this do the easy stuff

1069
01:41:15,000 --> 01:41:17,000
just gonna do the easy stuff

1070
01:41:23,000 --> 01:41:26,000
capa imagine being that guy

1071
01:41:27,000 --> 01:41:35,000
your entire your face is a timeless internet thing

1072
01:41:40,000 --> 01:41:42,000
I don't know yeah we go you know I always go zip gun

1073
01:41:44,000 --> 01:41:48,000
no it's like the first level that's not even necessary it's gonna go to the

1074
01:41:48,000 --> 01:41:57,000
regular machine gun no no ramp spike you go just this standard blaster I think oh

1075
01:41:58,000 --> 01:42:03,000
mouse for no mouse war now works by the way my wife is a black screen what the hell

1076
01:42:07,000 --> 01:42:13,000
black screen what what

1077
01:42:13,000 --> 01:42:21,000
that doesn't make any sense why would that why why

1078
01:42:26,000 --> 01:42:35,000
oh god I figured it out hold on we gotta add this thought I added this already

1079
01:42:35,000 --> 01:42:43,000
apparently not apparently not

1080
01:42:47,000 --> 01:42:49,000
now I'm back hi now you can see

1081
01:42:55,000 --> 01:43:00,000
and bro I broke something I always breaks shit but anyways mouse for wasn't working for me

1082
01:43:00,000 --> 01:43:07,000
before it is now I can actually use grenades and not have to hit f which was a pain in the

1083
01:43:07,000 --> 01:43:15,000
uh but I'm okay with this in fact I don't even need this many grenades

1084
01:43:18,000 --> 01:43:22,000
load up max 100k no supply pods that sounds easy enough

1085
01:43:22,000 --> 01:43:25,000
you can take one of these down to probably

1086
01:43:29,000 --> 01:43:29,000
that sounds good to me

1087
01:43:34,000 --> 01:43:36,000
all right what are we working with

1088
01:43:39,000 --> 01:43:47,000
we've got shield here alarm system there and then cord to destroy this is kryptark by the way

1089
01:43:53,000 --> 01:43:58,000
you found your shield to mouse for in your second but that's actually not a bad idea I might try

1090
01:43:58,000 --> 01:44:07,000
that in a minute we'll see uh we're just gonna go in this way I'm taking the alarm system out

1091
01:44:07,000 --> 01:44:12,000
but I got up a bat get a couple tech upgrades get a couple keys and destroy this

1092
01:44:14,000 --> 01:44:17,000
but I cannot if I want to get the bonus as I can't take any supply pods

1093
01:44:18,000 --> 01:44:24,000
let's try to go around up to the top right and something I didn't know you can actually put

1094
01:44:24,000 --> 01:44:28,000
waypoints if you click did not know that at all the last time

1095
01:44:32,000 --> 01:44:32,000
let's go

1096
01:44:37,000 --> 01:44:37,000
kryptark

1097
01:44:38,000 --> 01:44:45,000
right in the door here oh

1098
01:44:47,000 --> 01:44:47,000
let's get it

1099
01:44:53,000 --> 01:44:55,000
now I can very effectively

1100
01:44:58,000 --> 01:45:02,000
that does work look at that you can actually block the

1101
01:45:02,000 --> 01:45:08,000
ship with your shield can't you you know it's triggerly alarm if you do that

1102
01:45:09,000 --> 01:45:12,000
something I didn't know before you know remember the last time I played this I didn't know

1103
01:45:12,000 --> 01:45:19,000
what the hell is going on well I sort of sort of do now he's the term very loosely

1104
01:45:23,000 --> 01:45:26,000
auto cannon okay that's one of the best items in the game

1105
01:45:26,000 --> 01:45:32,000
what we're going next we're gonna go down right here

1106
01:45:47,000 --> 01:45:48,000
yeah

1107
01:45:48,000 --> 01:45:52,000
yeah I think I got too many grenades too for the first level

1108
01:45:55,000 --> 01:45:55,000
maybe

1109
01:46:04,000 --> 01:46:10,000
away from me oh fuck green slime screwed my head there

1110
01:46:10,000 --> 01:46:17,000
it's anything else I want to do here go that way grab the tech

1111
01:46:23,000 --> 01:46:28,000
why do I know if I nuclear throne I don't know I knew that it's just to I never

1112
01:46:28,000 --> 01:46:34,000
never really appealed to me very much I thought it was cool concept but back when I

1113
01:46:34,000 --> 01:46:37,000
oh boy hold on I gotta pay attention here

1114
01:46:40,000 --> 01:46:44,000
these enemies are like awful they just shoot back they blow your stuff in random directions

1115
01:46:49,000 --> 01:46:51,000
try to get on good

1116
01:46:53,000 --> 01:46:58,000
the game was very very early when I first got like a chance to see it then like they've

1117
01:46:58,000 --> 01:47:01,000
been doing a ton of updates to it it's been getting a lot of updates pretty much

1118
01:47:01,000 --> 01:47:07,000
I can't figure out the wake or something right I don't know something I never really got into

1119
01:47:14,000 --> 01:47:17,000
one more yeah

1120
01:47:23,000 --> 01:47:29,000
I think I got all three of the bonuses too what's this an EU friendly stream

1121
01:47:32,000 --> 01:47:41,000
it is it's like afternoon plus three three max hole oh okay now wait I guess I screwed that up

1122
01:47:41,000 --> 01:47:52,000
did that wrong honestly games like this that are very very difficult that require a ton of

1123
01:47:52,000 --> 01:47:59,000
precision like a huge amount of concentration and a ton of like bullet dodging and I just

1124
01:47:59,000 --> 01:48:07,000
know I it my brain can't do it I get stuck in walls I overreacting and bad shit happens to me

1125
01:48:13,000 --> 01:48:18,000
I screw up one thing and then it's just a chain reaction but I have an auto cannon now so that's

1126
01:48:18,000 --> 01:48:29,000
really amazing I'm gonna put it on here really expensive max load up 60k I don't even care

1127
01:48:32,000 --> 01:48:33,000
got a trench gun

1128
01:48:38,000 --> 01:48:44,000
oh no stay with the machine gun for now I don't even actually know and take the auto cannon off

1129
01:48:44,000 --> 01:48:50,000
it's unnecessary for right now there's just too much money for it's like a level two place I don't

1130
01:48:50,000 --> 01:49:01,000
do that so let's instead put the blaster back on I will take another heal this time though just

1131
01:49:01,000 --> 01:49:10,000
no I won't I'm gonna take I think I'm gonna stay with that maybe do I need a key maybe

1132
01:49:11,000 --> 01:49:22,000
go right up here drone factory yeah these are drone factories are huge deal they just keep

1133
01:49:22,000 --> 01:49:28,000
spawning enemies can't do bullet dodging but plays pretty well in Isaac

1134
01:49:31,000 --> 01:49:38,000
Isaac I don't know Isaac is a lot slower right Isaac is a lot more deliberate and slower the

1135
01:49:38,000 --> 01:49:45,000
rooms are small and there's not a whole lot of things in the room this game and the games like

1136
01:49:45,000 --> 01:49:51,000
nuclear thrown in games that are in this kind of genre there's so much stuff happening around you

1137
01:49:51,000 --> 01:49:56,000
that it is almost impossible to slow down and like sin know what you're doing unless you have

1138
01:49:56,000 --> 01:50:01,000
like a really good like lightning reaction speeds that GPS wanted to take me in a really really

1139
01:50:01,000 --> 01:50:19,000
awful direction and plus I do I don't look I like the team meet games like Isaac

1140
01:50:19,000 --> 01:50:23,000
Meat Boy they're like very fun interesting games to me

1141
01:50:26,000 --> 01:50:28,000
all right where am I going here to go down in here

1142
01:50:35,000 --> 01:50:36,000
don't want to get rid of that yet

1143
01:50:39,000 --> 01:50:41,000
scared even touched that actually

1144
01:50:50,000 --> 01:50:57,000
oh shit oh fuck I forgot where to take me I don't even know where to put me

1145
01:50:59,000 --> 01:51:03,000
hopefully not that far away no thank god it didn't put me somewhere else horrible

1146
01:51:04,000 --> 01:51:06,000
forgot when you blow up those things they do that

1147
01:51:06,000 --> 01:51:19,000
is that affected by the alarm no thanks so put them on a mission

1148
01:51:19,000 --> 01:51:44,000
there we go no keep a keep alarm systems I hate the alarm systems I despise them so I'm

1149
01:51:44,000 --> 01:51:49,000
I'm totally happy with just blowing them up no supply pods I do want to take out

1150
01:51:50,000 --> 01:51:57,000
these the strong factory though no supply pods I can do that

1151
01:52:15,000 --> 01:52:17,000
stay away from that shit

1152
01:52:20,000 --> 01:52:25,000
yeah sorry I'm not like looking at chat right now this this game like requires you're 100% of your attention

1153
01:52:35,000 --> 01:52:43,000
it's very good though it's very good and it's in early access somehow this early access game

1154
01:52:43,000 --> 01:52:50,000
feels like it's it been done for a while I don't need a key

1155
01:52:56,000 --> 01:52:58,000
all right that's it that's all there is to it

1156
01:53:03,000 --> 01:53:06,000
you can actually cook the grenades I don't know why I'm not doing that more often

1157
01:53:13,000 --> 01:53:32,000
boom is the game for a game is not free I think it's like 10 bucks 15 10 12 so

1158
01:53:32,000 --> 01:53:34,000
might think it's on sale initially here

1159
01:53:43,000 --> 01:53:45,000
burn out all resources

1160
01:53:45,000 --> 01:54:04,000
you have your satis today or your what is it what's a p it's something like that it's the

1161
01:54:04,000 --> 01:54:07,000
original the first one the pre satis

1162
01:54:13,000 --> 01:54:17,000
I actually don't have frequently asked questions I feel bad for people that are kind of

1163
01:54:17,000 --> 01:54:24,000
just coming in here and being like oh who though what is this I'm not I'm not a streamer yet

1164
01:54:24,000 --> 01:54:28,000
but that's kind of trying to

1165
01:54:36,000 --> 01:54:40,000
all right I got money now stay will stay with the three

1166
01:54:41,000 --> 01:54:48,000
because these are very hard really like last time when I'm when I streamed this game

1167
01:54:48,000 --> 01:54:52,000
I was doing the hardest ones I was like going in with chain guns on every slot

1168
01:54:53,000 --> 01:54:59,000
it was really stupid so I'm just gonna stay nice and safe in my comfortable three

1169
01:55:00,000 --> 01:55:05,000
and eventually it's gonna be five but just to get this guess to get past the first few areas

1170
01:55:05,000 --> 01:55:11,000
there's no reason but in my opinion to blow money and waste it because you're trying to do like

1171
01:55:11,000 --> 01:55:20,000
the extremely difficult ships 48,000 followers and he's just starting out well here's my streamer

1172
01:55:21,000 --> 01:55:29,000
um story is the tale of my stream I streamed I've been like doing youtube and stuff for those of you

1173
01:55:29,000 --> 01:55:34,000
then I've just I've just I've somehow found this channel and you have no idea what's going on

1174
01:55:35,000 --> 01:55:42,000
I do I do like youtube I mean like I mostly do youtube and like four years ago I live streamed

1175
01:55:43,000 --> 01:55:48,000
like maybe once or twice a week for a while and then I stopped for two straight years

1176
01:55:49,000 --> 01:55:55,000
so like all these followers I would say it probably like 70% of the people that followed this

1177
01:55:55,000 --> 01:56:00,000
stream like four years ago or like three years ago that's where the majority of those

1178
01:56:00,000 --> 01:56:10,000
followers came from now I'm starting to uh start it back up again and get back into it a little

1179
01:56:10,000 --> 01:56:21,000
I guess you could say so do zip gun you're not gonna go zip gun I love this thing

1180
01:56:23,000 --> 01:56:29,000
zip gun will keep the blaster did I get any different grenades sticky grenades they're more expensive

1181
01:56:29,000 --> 01:56:39,000
I'm at 100k can't max 100k if I do another fixer will that

1182
01:56:42,000 --> 01:56:51,000
that'll be 10 could get rid of the blattin all I get I'll just stick with the regular grenades

1183
01:56:52,000 --> 01:56:53,000
that way I can stay on our 100k

1184
01:56:54,000 --> 01:57:00,000
do you think you started the new channel on youtube and no one knew who you were could you become

1185
01:57:01,000 --> 01:57:08,000
big again I don't know man it's a lot more difficult if you want to start streaming or start

1186
01:57:08,000 --> 01:57:13,000
doing youtube or start getting into this kind of like as you could call like I seen

1187
01:57:14,000 --> 01:57:19,000
back when I started five years ago there weren't as many people doing it then you know fast forward

1188
01:57:19,000 --> 01:57:25,000
a few years you go down there's just go to like browse a random game on twitch even if you open up

1189
01:57:25,000 --> 01:57:31,000
like one of the popular games there are like hundreds of potential channels maybe even at some point

1190
01:57:31,000 --> 01:57:36,000
like in like the multiple hundreds and hundreds maybe even like a thousand channels streaming

1191
01:57:36,000 --> 01:57:42,000
in a really popular game or something release hundreds so it's hard to stand out

1192
01:57:42,000 --> 01:57:48,000
shit it's got a cloaking device on it that sucks

1193
01:57:52,000 --> 01:58:00,000
sensor jamer repair what else we got this is the most obnoxious so that has to go

1194
01:58:02,000 --> 01:58:03,000
this kind of has to go

1195
01:58:04,000 --> 01:58:04,000
so

1196
01:58:08,000 --> 01:58:16,000
this has to go first then this then this so we're gonna go into here I'm gonna do I don't think I

1197
01:58:16,000 --> 01:58:25,000
even have the tech upgrade for the sensor I don't shit this is gonna be annoying I this is

1198
01:58:25,000 --> 01:58:31,000
really really really really we're gonna have to just go and blind I'm just gonna make sure I don't

1199
01:58:31,000 --> 01:58:33,000
die

1200
01:58:37,000 --> 01:58:42,000
let's see if there's an entrance up here if there's an entrance up here I'm gonna try to get rid of this

1201
01:58:42,000 --> 01:58:47,000
even though it's being held by repair there is an entrance right here but I don't want to trip the alarm

1202
01:58:47,000 --> 01:58:56,000
okay

1203
01:58:59,000 --> 01:59:05,000
tractor beam it's terrible it's dark in here

1204
01:59:05,000 --> 01:59:14,000
oh come on

1205
01:59:16,000 --> 01:59:18,000
it's too dark I can't see anything

1206
01:59:21,000 --> 01:59:24,000
I've already taken way too much damage I don't have the key to get in there

1207
01:59:25,000 --> 01:59:27,000
okay

1208
01:59:30,000 --> 01:59:32,000
key right there

1209
01:59:48,000 --> 01:59:51,000
these drones I gotta get rid of the drone factory

1210
01:59:51,000 --> 01:59:54,000
I might be able to go a different way but whatever

1211
02:00:02,000 --> 02:00:07,000
all right now that I have a second here sensor jammers been deactivated I need to go here I need

1212
02:00:07,000 --> 02:00:12,000
a key that's key right there we're golden let's go

1213
02:00:21,000 --> 02:00:24,000
I just a lot of shit on the screen right now I can't even see key right in the here

1214
02:00:26,000 --> 02:00:28,000
look at this

1215
02:00:42,000 --> 02:00:45,000
oh my goodness these stupid fucking things I hate these things

1216
02:00:45,000 --> 02:00:51,000
all right now that we have that out of the way

1217
02:00:53,000 --> 02:00:55,000
can get rid of the alarm system

1218
02:00:56,000 --> 02:00:59,000
I got your course I come back and I get hit that sucked

1219
02:01:02,000 --> 02:01:04,000
much I got plenty ammo be okay

1220
02:01:08,000 --> 02:01:11,000
that requires a key to do I have a key right no no I don't

1221
02:01:15,000 --> 02:01:19,000
I might just do this without oh yeah screw it who cares about the alarm

1222
02:01:21,000 --> 02:01:25,000
destroy sentry systems and no supply pods where are the sentry systems

1223
02:01:27,000 --> 02:01:32,000
way too far out of my way yeah we're just gonna go without it we're just gonna get rid of the

1224
02:01:32,000 --> 02:01:36,000
shield and just go right there and just trigger the alarm and hopefully we can destroy it fast enough

1225
02:01:40,000 --> 02:01:42,000
fuck that's not cool

1226
02:01:45,000 --> 02:01:56,000
I'm just behind the locked door

1227
02:02:06,000 --> 02:02:09,000
using ammo I didn't want to use

1228
02:02:15,000 --> 02:02:18,000
Is this behind a locked door too?

1229
02:02:18,000 --> 02:02:23,000
Please tell me it isn't. It is. Of course it is, but the least is a key right there.

1230
02:02:23,000 --> 02:02:34,000
He had a way for me. I saw you do that, you little shit.

1231
02:02:34,000 --> 02:02:53,000
I just fucking hit myself with a grenade. Be into impatient. I gotta slow it down. Be into impatient.

1232
02:02:53,000 --> 02:03:04,000
Let's get that key. This so many things in that room. How much time do I have left?

1233
02:03:04,000 --> 02:03:10,000
Not a whole lot. I don't think there is any more room. Now we have to go just boss the wall.

1234
02:03:10,000 --> 02:03:14,000
I'm just gonna have to go for it. Run out of ammo too.

1235
02:03:14,000 --> 02:03:25,000
So we're just gonna go destroy it and hope I can just spam grenades at it. Be on the win.

1236
02:03:25,000 --> 02:03:36,000
Anything in that room? No.

1237
02:03:36,000 --> 02:03:55,000
Wait for me. Alright boys and girls. We're going for spam strats.

1238
02:03:55,000 --> 02:04:02,000
That might have to clear this room a little though.

1239
02:04:02,000 --> 02:04:14,000
Spam scratch. Holy dog shit. Oh my god.

1240
02:04:14,000 --> 02:04:22,000
That's done to know where I am. Where I don't know what happened. That holy fuck.

1241
02:04:22,000 --> 02:04:26,000
Did you see how much stuff was in that room?

1242
02:04:26,000 --> 02:04:34,000
There were like four laser turrets on the walls. I actually did not. I saw the stuff.

1243
02:04:34,000 --> 02:04:41,000
That was dumb. Everything was behind a locked door and I didn't have any keys. That sucked.

1244
02:04:45,000 --> 02:04:51,000
Now I'm gonna look and see it. If every single god damn door is locked then I need to bring a key.

1245
02:04:51,000 --> 02:04:54,000
That was really fucking annoying.

1246
02:04:54,000 --> 02:05:03,000
Oh what's this? There is two locked doors in this whole place this time.

1247
02:05:03,000 --> 02:05:11,000
And look I can just go. Holy crap. You shitting me.

1248
02:05:11,000 --> 02:05:19,000
Well that's what happens when you roll the dice on a procedurally generated game.

1249
02:05:19,000 --> 02:05:24,000
Sometimes every single door will be locked and sometimes the brain will be protected by the shield.

1250
02:05:24,000 --> 02:05:32,000
That's literally 50 feet away from it. That's the way the cookie crumbles.

1251
02:05:32,000 --> 02:05:42,000
Look at this. Oh guys. I better watch out for this locked door.

1252
02:05:42,000 --> 02:05:48,000
How well I have a get in there. I have a get inside of that locked door.

1253
02:05:48,000 --> 02:05:50,000
Shit.

1254
02:05:53,000 --> 02:05:56,000
Alright. Enough complaining. Let's play.

1255
02:06:01,000 --> 02:06:04,000
Let me make sure there's nothing in here.

1256
02:06:06,000 --> 02:06:08,000
I don't care about that.

1257
02:06:08,000 --> 02:06:10,000
I could just get.

1258
02:06:10,000 --> 02:06:14,000
Yeah. I'm just... We're just gonna do the same thing.

1259
02:06:14,000 --> 02:06:18,000
There's no alarm system in this one either.

1260
02:06:18,000 --> 02:06:22,000
This one should be fairly easy.

1261
02:06:22,000 --> 02:06:28,000
Whoever made that door to lock it was shit-faced.

1262
02:06:32,000 --> 02:06:36,000
I'm just gonna do auto cannon.

1263
02:06:36,000 --> 02:06:40,000
I'm just gonna do auto cannon and get in there and just blow it down.

1264
02:06:40,000 --> 02:06:44,000
That sounds good.

1265
02:06:44,000 --> 02:06:46,000
I don't need any keys.

1266
02:06:46,000 --> 02:06:50,000
Right. There's all these doors are open.

1267
02:06:50,000 --> 02:06:52,000
I need one key.

1268
02:06:52,000 --> 02:06:58,000
Go in there and get the tech and then beat the level unless to a minute.

1269
02:06:58,000 --> 02:07:02,000
This game is cryptark.

1270
02:07:02,000 --> 02:07:06,000
It's on steam right now.

1271
02:07:06,000 --> 02:07:10,000
I'm not sure about if it's coming to consoles or not.

1272
02:07:10,000 --> 02:07:14,000
I don't know. I really just don't have any idea.

1273
02:07:14,000 --> 02:07:18,000
I wish I could TV that intel.

1274
02:07:18,000 --> 02:07:22,000
Oh shit. Hold on.

1275
02:07:22,000 --> 02:07:26,000
Make sure we're going the right way here.

1276
02:07:26,000 --> 02:07:34,000
There's no alarm system so I don't have to be worried about anything besides just clearing this room.

1277
02:07:34,000 --> 02:07:40,000
I guess I could put this shield down.

1278
02:07:40,000 --> 02:07:46,000
God, those things are so horrible.

1279
02:07:46,000 --> 02:07:52,000
Those things do like two points of damage ahead in this so brutal.

1280
02:07:52,000 --> 02:07:56,000
Okay, that room- this one's okay now.

1281
02:07:56,000 --> 02:08:00,000
I'm just gonna do this.

1282
02:08:00,000 --> 02:08:04,000
Watch out guys.

1283
02:08:04,000 --> 02:08:08,000
Shit. What are we- how are we gonna get rid of this?

1284
02:08:08,000 --> 02:08:12,000
I'm gonna get rid of this.

1285
02:08:12,000 --> 02:08:30,000
Oh, that's a bad way to go.

1286
02:08:30,000 --> 02:08:34,000
Oh wow, holy fuck.

1287
02:08:34,000 --> 02:08:36,000
I was wrong.

1288
02:08:36,000 --> 02:08:38,000
I forgot that. I forgot it was not the one-

1289
02:08:38,000 --> 02:08:46,000
Okay, right. That's what I get for not paying attention to that.

1290
02:08:46,000 --> 02:08:54,000
Damn.

1291
02:08:54,000 --> 02:09:02,000
At least there's no alarm system.

1292
02:09:02,000 --> 02:09:08,000
Put your shield down.

1293
02:09:08,000 --> 02:09:16,000
There's a lot of these turrets in this one too, unfortunately.

1294
02:09:16,000 --> 02:09:28,000
I might actually get the- yeah, I'm gonna get it.

1295
02:09:28,000 --> 02:09:32,000
I just totally forgot that it did whatever was connected to what-

1296
02:09:32,000 --> 02:09:34,000
So what was that shielding then?

1297
02:09:34,000 --> 02:09:40,000
That's the question.

1298
02:09:52,000 --> 02:09:56,000
This whole level is turrets.

1299
02:09:56,000 --> 02:10:08,000
Nikes.

1300
02:10:08,000 --> 02:10:12,000
More locks.

1301
02:10:12,000 --> 02:10:18,000
At least the ones that are connected do.

1302
02:10:18,000 --> 02:10:22,000
Kinetic buffer.

1303
02:10:22,000 --> 02:10:28,000
I've never heard of that one.

1304
02:10:28,000 --> 02:10:30,000
Ah, you are so annoying.

1305
02:10:30,000 --> 02:10:32,000
You are very, very annoying.

1306
02:10:32,000 --> 02:10:40,000
All right, so that will take that down.

1307
02:10:40,000 --> 02:10:42,000
What was it I have to destroy the flacking trolleys?

1308
02:10:42,000 --> 02:10:44,000
Oh, that's not a flacking trolleur.

1309
02:10:44,000 --> 02:10:46,000
Did I already get them all?

1310
02:10:46,000 --> 02:10:54,000
I got all the flacking trolleys.

1311
02:10:54,000 --> 02:10:58,000
I don't even need to do that.

1312
02:10:58,000 --> 02:11:04,000
There's nothing protecting you, but wasn't- what?

1313
02:11:04,000 --> 02:11:12,000
I'm kind of confused here.

1314
02:11:12,000 --> 02:11:20,000
I'm confused.

1315
02:11:20,000 --> 02:11:22,000
I'll have to attack.

1316
02:11:22,000 --> 02:11:24,000
Is there any more tech? I don't have any tech.

1317
02:11:24,000 --> 02:11:26,000
There's one up there.

1318
02:11:26,000 --> 02:11:32,000
Kind of running at a time, but- whatever.

1319
02:11:32,000 --> 02:11:38,000
Whatever. Let's just get rid of it.

1320
02:11:38,000 --> 02:12:02,000
All right, you're going to like the nest.

1321
02:12:02,000 --> 02:12:04,000
Do you have to destroy everything?

1322
02:12:04,000 --> 02:12:06,000
No, you don't.

1323
02:12:06,000 --> 02:12:08,000
I don't know if you- did I even take out another?

1324
02:12:08,000 --> 02:12:10,000
I like to watch that part of the stream back.

1325
02:12:10,000 --> 02:12:16,000
Because I took out the shield, and it was still shielded.

1326
02:12:16,000 --> 02:12:18,000
But the thing that I destroyed up there, that wasn't a shield?

1327
02:12:18,000 --> 02:12:20,000
Was it? Was it the thing that I went up there?

1328
02:12:20,000 --> 02:12:22,000
A shield?

1329
02:12:22,000 --> 02:12:24,000
I don't know.

1330
02:12:24,000 --> 02:12:28,000
Apparently not.

1331
02:12:36,000 --> 02:12:46,000
Where am I going now?

1332
02:12:46,000 --> 02:12:50,000
It was the redundancy building.

1333
02:12:50,000 --> 02:12:54,000
Potentially.

1334
02:12:54,000 --> 02:13:04,000
A door lock system and something else.

1335
02:13:04,000 --> 02:13:08,000
Yeah, I want to watch that part back.

1336
02:13:08,000 --> 02:13:12,000
No idea.

1337
02:13:12,000 --> 02:13:18,000
It was very odd.

1338
02:13:18,000 --> 02:13:20,000
Definitely keeping the auto cannon though.

1339
02:13:20,000 --> 02:13:22,000
That different machine, though.

1340
02:13:22,000 --> 02:13:24,000
These are- you know.

1341
02:13:24,000 --> 02:13:26,000
The current game is Victor-Vran.

1342
02:13:26,000 --> 02:13:40,000
It's not- it is not Victor-Vran.

1343
02:13:40,000 --> 02:13:48,000
Nightbot- you really screwed this up.

1344
02:13:48,000 --> 02:13:50,000
I need more ammo than that though.

1345
02:13:50,000 --> 02:13:52,000
What's the max?

1346
02:13:52,000 --> 02:13:54,000
A lot of 60k.

1347
02:13:54,000 --> 02:13:56,000
I'm not going to be able to do that.

1348
02:13:56,000 --> 02:14:00,000
Yeah, this is the Victor-Vran of the future.

1349
02:14:00,000 --> 02:14:04,000
The current game is a Victor-Vran.

1350
02:14:04,000 --> 02:14:08,000
This Victor-Vran game sure looks fun.

1351
02:14:08,000 --> 02:14:12,000
Maybe it really is.

1352
02:14:12,000 --> 02:14:14,000
I'm not going to stay.

1353
02:14:14,000 --> 02:14:16,000
Just try and true with the machine gun.

1354
02:14:16,000 --> 02:14:18,000
It's just too good.

1355
02:14:18,000 --> 02:14:20,000
And the auto cannon.

1356
02:14:20,000 --> 02:14:22,000
Yeah, we're just going to stay with that.

1357
02:14:22,000 --> 02:14:24,000
I also got a new- what if I got something new?

1358
02:14:24,000 --> 02:14:26,000
Didn't I?

1359
02:14:26,000 --> 02:14:30,000
Laser.

1360
02:14:30,000 --> 02:14:32,000
I'm not going to stay with that.

1361
02:14:32,000 --> 02:14:36,000
I'm not going to stay with that.

1362
02:14:36,000 --> 02:14:46,000
That's really expensive.

1363
02:14:46,000 --> 02:14:54,000
I'm not going to do it.

1364
02:14:54,000 --> 02:14:58,000
Okay.

1365
02:14:58,000 --> 02:15:00,000
Repair station up here.

1366
02:15:00,000 --> 02:15:02,000
Is there more than one reviewer?

1367
02:15:02,000 --> 02:15:04,000
There are more than- all these the worst.

1368
02:15:04,000 --> 02:15:12,000
These are the worst.

1369
02:15:12,000 --> 02:15:14,000
Yeah, I have a Twitch partnership from like four years ago.

1370
02:15:14,000 --> 02:15:20,000
So whatever the partnership was, four years ago is the one that I have.

1371
02:15:20,000 --> 02:15:24,000
So when you have two repair stations, it really sucks because you have to end up going in

1372
02:15:24,000 --> 02:15:30,000
and- both of these pretty much have to be destroyed.

1373
02:15:30,000 --> 02:15:38,000
So I'm going to have to go down.

1374
02:15:38,000 --> 02:15:40,000
Yeah, we're going to go in here.

1375
02:15:40,000 --> 02:15:42,000
We're going to go down.

1376
02:15:42,000 --> 02:15:44,000
There's a key.

1377
02:15:44,000 --> 02:15:46,000
I have a key.

1378
02:15:46,000 --> 02:15:48,000
There's also one there.

1379
02:15:48,000 --> 02:15:50,000
I need a key to get into the- the more locked doors everywhere.

1380
02:15:50,000 --> 02:15:56,000
I picked the wrong one.

1381
02:15:56,000 --> 02:15:58,000
Does this guy really deserve to have his gaming license back?

1382
02:15:58,000 --> 02:16:02,000
He's still going around using a faulty nightbot.

1383
02:16:02,000 --> 02:16:04,000
I don't have it back.

1384
02:16:04,000 --> 02:16:10,000
I have my learned experiment.

1385
02:16:10,000 --> 02:16:11,000
I'm going to go down.

1386
02:16:11,000 --> 02:16:12,000
I got a key.

1387
02:16:12,000 --> 02:16:13,000
There's a key right there I can take.

1388
02:16:13,000 --> 02:16:18,000
I'm going to destroy the two repair stations as we go.

1389
02:16:18,000 --> 02:16:20,000
So I'm going to do- sounds good to me.

1390
02:16:20,000 --> 02:16:25,000
How about it?

1391
02:16:25,000 --> 02:16:28,000
I don't want to go that way.

1392
02:16:28,000 --> 02:16:32,000
My GPS device is freaking out.

1393
02:16:32,000 --> 02:16:34,000
Greetings from Bulgaria.

1394
02:16:34,000 --> 02:16:35,000
Hi.

1395
02:16:35,000 --> 02:16:40,000
Greetings from the United States.

1396
02:16:40,000 --> 02:16:42,000
I got to go all the way out.

1397
02:16:42,000 --> 02:16:50,000
This is going to be a long one.

1398
02:16:50,000 --> 02:16:57,000
I don't know if I have faith in this one.

1399
02:16:57,000 --> 02:16:59,000
It might not even be worth destroying that drone.

1400
02:16:59,000 --> 02:17:05,000
Drawing- drawing- drawing facility just yet.

1401
02:17:05,000 --> 02:17:06,000
But I don't know.

1402
02:17:06,000 --> 02:17:13,000
I don't know how much time I'm going to have.

1403
02:17:13,000 --> 02:17:19,000
Because if there's two repair facilities, I'm going to have to call ass after this is destroyed.

1404
02:17:19,000 --> 02:17:28,000
Gotta go.

1405
02:17:28,000 --> 02:17:29,000
Gotta go.

1406
02:17:29,000 --> 02:17:35,000
All ass.

1407
02:17:35,000 --> 02:17:36,000
Oh shit.

1408
02:17:36,000 --> 02:17:40,000
That's the thing that blows up right?

1409
02:17:40,000 --> 02:17:41,000
No, I don't want to go that way.

1410
02:17:41,000 --> 02:17:42,000
It's a waste of key.

1411
02:17:42,000 --> 02:17:43,000
You see what I'm saying?

1412
02:17:43,000 --> 02:17:46,000
With two of those facilities going?

1413
02:17:46,000 --> 02:17:49,000
It's hard to-

1414
02:17:49,000 --> 02:17:51,000
Yeah, it's going to come back.

1415
02:17:51,000 --> 02:17:58,000
But at least they've gotten rid of some of those drones without being too much of pain they have.

1416
02:17:58,000 --> 02:18:01,000
I really wish you two weren't so annoying.

1417
02:18:01,000 --> 02:18:05,000
I really wish you weren't that annoying.

1418
02:18:05,000 --> 02:18:07,000
You just block in the way in.

1419
02:18:07,000 --> 02:18:15,000
You chump get out of the way.

1420
02:18:16,000 --> 02:18:20,000
Oh my god.

1421
02:18:20,000 --> 02:18:25,000
Whenever the he's- it's just getting repaired too.

1422
02:18:25,000 --> 02:18:27,000
It's tiny little rum.

1423
02:18:27,000 --> 02:18:31,000
Oh, that was horrible.

1424
02:18:31,000 --> 02:18:33,000
I have to get rid of this other one.

1425
02:18:33,000 --> 02:18:41,000
Quick, quick, quick, quick, quick.

1426
02:18:41,000 --> 02:18:43,000
All right, call me crazy.

1427
02:18:43,000 --> 02:18:46,000
You can go ahead and call me crazy.

1428
02:18:46,000 --> 02:18:49,000
I'm going around the ship.

1429
02:18:49,000 --> 02:18:57,000
I'm going to go around the damn ship and go in the not so hostile way.

1430
02:18:57,000 --> 02:19:00,000
20%

1431
02:19:00,000 --> 02:19:04,000
Which way right in here and then down and around.

1432
02:19:04,000 --> 02:19:11,000
I need to get that fucking key.

1433
02:19:12,000 --> 02:19:14,000
Is there a key right there?

1434
02:19:14,000 --> 02:19:21,000
Nope.

1435
02:19:21,000 --> 02:19:23,000
Where's the key?

1436
02:19:23,000 --> 02:19:30,000
Up there.

1437
02:19:30,000 --> 02:19:32,000
How much time do I got?

1438
02:19:32,000 --> 02:19:36,000
41%.

1439
02:19:36,000 --> 02:19:37,000
No, what?

1440
02:19:37,000 --> 02:19:38,000
No.

1441
02:19:38,000 --> 02:19:39,000
What the hell?

1442
02:19:39,000 --> 02:19:41,000
Oh my god.

1443
02:19:41,000 --> 02:19:43,000
What the fuck?

1444
02:19:43,000 --> 02:19:47,000
I'm trying to open a door.

1445
02:19:47,000 --> 02:19:48,000
Refill ammo?

1446
02:19:48,000 --> 02:19:50,000
No, I don't want to refill ammo.

1447
02:19:50,000 --> 02:19:53,000
Okay, well now just get destroyed because you didn't open the door.

1448
02:19:53,000 --> 02:20:02,000
And I'm very, very angry.

1449
02:20:02,000 --> 02:20:08,000
I just got it.

1450
02:20:08,000 --> 02:20:10,000
Let's get rid of this.

1451
02:20:10,000 --> 02:20:14,000
Now we can take my time because now things aren't respawning every two seconds.

1452
02:20:14,000 --> 02:20:23,000
Get trolled.

1453
02:20:23,000 --> 02:20:37,000
I actually am going to take this because I want the cannon.

1454
02:20:37,000 --> 02:20:40,000
The cannon is so amazing.

1455
02:20:40,000 --> 02:20:44,000
That door is locked.

1456
02:20:44,000 --> 02:20:45,000
Is that stuck in there?

1457
02:20:45,000 --> 02:20:52,000
Can I not even go in that room?

1458
02:20:52,000 --> 02:20:56,000
I'm going to have to reroute this.

1459
02:20:56,000 --> 02:20:59,000
I can't get in there.

1460
02:20:59,000 --> 02:21:01,000
Can I like cheese it and get it?

1461
02:21:01,000 --> 02:21:06,000
No.

1462
02:21:06,000 --> 02:21:08,000
Holy shit.

1463
02:21:08,000 --> 02:21:15,000
No, you hit me.

1464
02:21:15,000 --> 02:21:24,000
See you in health.

1465
02:21:24,000 --> 02:21:34,000
Get out of my way.

1466
02:21:34,000 --> 02:21:36,000
God.

1467
02:21:36,000 --> 02:21:38,000
I really want to shut this alarm off.

1468
02:21:38,000 --> 02:21:41,000
It's worth me doing the key.

1469
02:21:41,000 --> 02:21:44,000
I will do this.

1470
02:21:44,000 --> 02:21:49,000
Don't want the alarm to go off because there are so many horrible things in that room down there.

1471
02:21:49,000 --> 02:22:00,000
I would not want to get swarmed with everything.

1472
02:22:00,000 --> 02:22:02,000
I'm going to get out of here.

1473
02:22:02,000 --> 02:22:04,000
What are you doing in here?

1474
02:22:04,000 --> 02:22:06,000
You're going to be a hero?

1475
02:22:06,000 --> 02:22:16,000
I don't think so, dude.

1476
02:22:16,000 --> 02:22:22,000
Well, so if you'd like to know what happened right there, my game froze.

1477
02:22:22,000 --> 02:22:25,000
I just didn't move.

1478
02:22:25,000 --> 02:22:27,000
I know it's worth probably freezing.

1479
02:22:27,000 --> 02:22:29,000
I don't think so.

1480
02:22:29,000 --> 02:22:35,000
Kind of a little.

1481
02:22:35,000 --> 02:22:40,000
I have to try and avoid all that for the game to freeze.

1482
02:22:40,000 --> 02:22:42,000
And you can hit by the alarm.

1483
02:22:42,000 --> 02:22:51,000
That's just fucking fantastic.

1484
02:22:52,000 --> 02:23:01,000
I need to look and see if there's one anywhere.

1485
02:23:01,000 --> 02:23:03,000
There is, but it's all the way over there.

1486
02:23:03,000 --> 02:23:10,000
I need to just sit in the corner and please game, please stop doing this.

1487
02:23:10,000 --> 02:23:14,000
I'm going to sit in this corner until this end.

1488
02:23:14,000 --> 02:23:17,000
Okay.

1489
02:23:18,000 --> 02:23:21,000
Nope.

1490
02:23:21,000 --> 02:23:26,000
I should be able to get back though.

1491
02:23:26,000 --> 02:23:31,000
Come on, come on.

1492
02:23:31,000 --> 02:23:39,000
This is going to be very, very difficult to do this.

1493
02:23:39,000 --> 02:23:44,000
I'm running out of time, but even if you run out of time, you don't lose.

1494
02:23:44,000 --> 02:23:46,000
But look at all the stuff that's in here.

1495
02:23:46,000 --> 02:23:55,000
This was a terrible, terrible one.

1496
02:23:55,000 --> 02:24:02,000
I'm just going to die because I want to restart the game.

1497
02:24:02,000 --> 02:24:05,000
It's just for some reason is doing like stuttering all over the place.

1498
02:24:05,000 --> 02:24:06,000
Give me a second.

1499
02:24:06,000 --> 02:24:08,000
Give me one second.

1500
02:24:08,000 --> 02:24:13,000
It saves my progress, don't worry.

1501
02:24:14,000 --> 02:24:18,000
My progress is saved.

1502
02:24:18,000 --> 02:24:23,000
Oh.

1503
02:24:23,000 --> 02:24:31,000
How am I going to exit?

1504
02:24:31,000 --> 02:24:40,000
Like that.

1505
02:24:40,000 --> 02:24:44,000
Remember me and Star we're talking about this the other day.

1506
02:24:44,000 --> 02:24:52,000
This game is amazing except for when it does that.

1507
02:24:52,000 --> 02:24:55,000
Should be right here.

1508
02:24:55,000 --> 02:24:58,000
Oh, key, key.

1509
02:24:58,000 --> 02:25:01,000
Yeah, that's Grova.

1510
02:25:01,000 --> 02:25:09,000
That's supposed to be good old Grova.

1511
02:25:09,000 --> 02:25:14,000
Yeah, that hold on screen was like 40 bucks.

1512
02:25:14,000 --> 02:25:27,000
I paid myself 40 dollars.

1513
02:25:27,000 --> 02:25:30,000
All right, are we good?

1514
02:25:30,000 --> 02:25:31,000
I think so.

1515
02:25:31,000 --> 02:25:34,000
I hope so.

1516
02:25:34,000 --> 02:25:45,000
That's a real run killer.

1517
02:25:45,000 --> 02:25:53,000
Keep the alarm systems.

1518
02:25:53,000 --> 02:25:55,000
I'm going to get on with the stickies on.

1519
02:25:55,000 --> 02:26:02,000
I like the sticky grenades a little bit better I think.

1520
02:26:02,000 --> 02:26:08,000
Now let's see what we got this time.

1521
02:26:08,000 --> 02:26:10,000
Oh, but I love God.

1522
02:26:10,000 --> 02:26:21,000
No, another one of these.

1523
02:26:21,000 --> 02:26:23,000
I got to try to get rid of that.

1524
02:26:23,000 --> 02:26:24,000
Is there any prepared things?

1525
02:26:24,000 --> 02:26:31,000
Yeah, all the way down here.

1526
02:26:31,000 --> 02:26:33,000
I'm going to go around this way.

1527
02:26:33,000 --> 02:26:35,000
These have to go down first.

1528
02:26:35,000 --> 02:26:40,000
Otherwise buildings just come back.

1529
02:26:40,000 --> 02:26:45,000
Why don't you have a stream of normal USA times that are like 7 a.m.

1530
02:26:45,000 --> 02:26:49,000
Because I'm trying to stay awake.

1531
02:26:49,000 --> 02:26:56,000
I'm trying to reset my sleep schedule in a way.

1532
02:26:56,000 --> 02:26:57,000
Max 100k.

1533
02:26:57,000 --> 02:26:58,000
What's my loadout right now?

1534
02:26:58,000 --> 02:26:59,000
123.

1535
02:26:59,000 --> 02:27:06,000
That's too much money.

1536
02:27:06,000 --> 02:27:07,000
Did I even need this key?

1537
02:27:07,000 --> 02:27:09,000
I guess I can't tell if I need the key because I can't save

1538
02:27:09,000 --> 02:27:10,000
there are any locked doors.

1539
02:27:10,000 --> 02:27:11,000
So we're going to keep it.

1540
02:27:11,000 --> 02:27:21,000
There's only two around the sport.

1541
02:27:21,000 --> 02:27:25,000
All right, well, I could try to keep none.

1542
02:27:25,000 --> 02:27:27,000
I don't need to take a supply pot.

1543
02:27:27,000 --> 02:27:30,000
Keeping the alarm systems is a really awful risk human over.

1544
02:27:30,000 --> 02:27:33,000
But especially when you can't see anything.

1545
02:27:33,000 --> 02:27:37,000
And I don't have the upgrade to be able to see things to go through it.

1546
02:27:37,000 --> 02:27:42,000
So we're going to try to get rid of the repair facility first.

1547
02:27:42,000 --> 02:27:44,000
I'm going to go down and around.

1548
02:27:44,000 --> 02:27:46,000
Where's my ship?

1549
02:27:46,000 --> 02:27:50,000
Up here.

1550
02:27:50,000 --> 02:27:59,000
I'm going to check out Victor Vran.

1551
02:27:59,000 --> 02:28:03,000
Hopefully there's an entryway down here.

1552
02:28:03,000 --> 02:28:05,000
Be great if there was one literally right here.

1553
02:28:05,000 --> 02:28:08,000
It would be amazing.

1554
02:28:08,000 --> 02:28:11,000
Yes, there is.

1555
02:28:11,000 --> 02:28:17,000
It's dark as hell.

1556
02:28:17,000 --> 02:28:35,000
I think I had a key.

1557
02:28:35,000 --> 02:28:37,000
Just keep coming from every direction.

1558
02:28:37,000 --> 02:28:40,000
And I don't know where to go.

1559
02:28:40,000 --> 02:28:41,000
I did to get rid of that sensor.

1560
02:28:41,000 --> 02:28:46,000
Sell that.

1561
02:28:46,000 --> 02:28:52,000
I just don't know the efficient way to move that way.

1562
02:28:52,000 --> 02:28:53,000
There isn't alarm.

1563
02:28:53,000 --> 02:29:01,000
Don't get touched by that.

1564
02:29:16,000 --> 02:29:24,000
I wish I had a better machine gun.

1565
02:29:24,000 --> 02:29:30,000
I can't even tell what a wall is.

1566
02:29:30,000 --> 02:29:31,000
That's really killing me.

1567
02:29:31,000 --> 02:29:32,000
He's not having a machine gun.

1568
02:29:32,000 --> 02:29:33,000
That's better.

1569
02:29:33,000 --> 02:29:35,000
Like a heavy machine gun or something.

1570
02:29:35,000 --> 02:29:37,000
Hopefully I can go in here.

1571
02:29:37,000 --> 02:29:43,000
Please don't make him go in there and get it.

1572
02:29:43,000 --> 02:29:45,000
Looks like I've done up.

1573
02:29:45,000 --> 02:29:52,000
No.

1574
02:29:52,000 --> 02:29:53,000
Oh my goodness.

1575
02:29:53,000 --> 02:29:58,000
Get away from me.

1576
02:29:58,000 --> 02:29:59,000
No, I can't go.

1577
02:29:59,000 --> 02:30:09,000
I got to go up through here.

1578
02:30:09,000 --> 02:30:13,000
God damn it.

1579
02:30:13,000 --> 02:30:17,000
Give me like a sneaky back entrance.

1580
02:30:17,000 --> 02:30:21,000
While I waste all this time looking for a how to move in this area.

1581
02:30:21,000 --> 02:30:30,000
Thank you.

1582
02:30:30,000 --> 02:30:41,000
Please let that be light.

1583
02:30:41,000 --> 02:30:49,000
How old are you going away from me?

1584
02:30:49,000 --> 02:30:52,000
Please.

1585
02:30:52,000 --> 02:30:53,000
You got no shield.

1586
02:30:53,000 --> 02:31:10,000
You need to second for the charge back up so I don't die.

1587
02:31:10,000 --> 02:31:12,000
Oh my brain.

1588
02:31:12,000 --> 02:31:21,000
Bullet hell.

1589
02:31:21,000 --> 02:31:28,000
Only the darkness wasn't consuming my body.

1590
02:31:28,000 --> 02:31:30,000
Oh, I can see.

1591
02:31:30,000 --> 02:31:37,000
Thank God.

1592
02:31:37,000 --> 02:31:47,000
Oh, we got to go down here.

1593
02:31:47,000 --> 02:31:55,000
It'll be so safe if I go down that way.

1594
02:31:55,000 --> 02:31:59,000
I love me a sneaky back entrance.

1595
02:31:59,000 --> 02:32:04,000
There's a key here but I mean mine as well just go that way anyways.

1596
02:32:04,000 --> 02:32:07,000
I just don't want to take unnecessary damage.

1597
02:32:07,000 --> 02:32:11,000
I don't know if it heals left.

1598
02:32:11,000 --> 02:32:14,000
I got 16 shots in the cannon.

1599
02:32:14,000 --> 02:32:19,000
I'm running out of ammo.

1600
02:32:19,000 --> 02:32:21,000
Thankfully there's not a whole lot left.

1601
02:32:21,000 --> 02:32:28,000
Is there a supply pod somewhere on the way?

1602
02:32:28,000 --> 02:32:31,000
We're going to play it safe.

1603
02:32:31,000 --> 02:32:34,000
I'm going to refill my ammo.

1604
02:32:34,000 --> 02:32:38,000
I know it'll be a really big deal later.

1605
02:32:38,000 --> 02:32:40,000
I'm going to be really mad if I didn't get it.

1606
02:32:40,000 --> 02:32:58,000
Keep alarm systems.

1607
02:32:58,000 --> 02:33:01,000
Extra money.

1608
02:33:01,000 --> 02:33:04,000
I don't know if I want to do that.

1609
02:33:04,000 --> 02:33:09,000
I haven't trouble enough as it is.

1610
02:33:09,000 --> 02:33:23,000
Quick shield.

1611
02:33:23,000 --> 02:33:26,000
No, is it worth it?

1612
02:33:26,000 --> 02:33:29,000
No, it's not.

1613
02:33:29,000 --> 02:33:32,000
Don't be a dummy.

1614
02:33:32,000 --> 02:33:35,000
Get rid of the alarm.

1615
02:33:35,000 --> 02:33:38,000
The dash across the whole screen in less than a second.

1616
02:33:38,000 --> 02:33:41,000
Make sure you get rid of those too.

1617
02:33:57,000 --> 02:34:00,000
Actually my put shield on a base button.

1618
02:34:00,000 --> 02:34:04,000
I feel like that would be a lot easier rather than have to hold down right click.

1619
02:34:04,000 --> 02:34:14,000
I said earlier, that guy is a smart guy.

1620
02:34:14,000 --> 02:34:16,000
Can't even walk into this room.

1621
02:34:16,000 --> 02:34:23,000
Dear Lord.

1622
02:34:35,000 --> 02:34:44,000
Open up.

1623
02:34:44,000 --> 02:34:51,000
Be really sneaky on this one.

1624
02:34:51,000 --> 02:34:53,000
Running out of health too.

1625
02:34:53,000 --> 02:35:00,000
That's a concern.

1626
02:35:00,000 --> 02:35:04,000
I don't want you to come up behind me and shoot right in my spine.

1627
02:35:04,000 --> 02:35:12,000
This is a busy ass room.

1628
02:35:12,000 --> 02:35:16,000
You just shot that away.

1629
02:35:16,000 --> 02:35:20,000
Running into the negative time here.

1630
02:35:20,000 --> 02:35:24,000
Whoa, getting stuck on shit.

1631
02:35:30,000 --> 02:35:56,000
40 seconds into the time.

1632
02:35:56,000 --> 02:35:59,000
Damn.

1633
02:35:59,000 --> 02:36:05,000
I'm going to lose money.

1634
02:36:05,000 --> 02:36:11,000
Running low on funds.

1635
02:36:11,000 --> 02:36:14,000
Why am I called Jerma?

1636
02:36:14,000 --> 02:36:17,000
My name is Jeremy.

1637
02:36:17,000 --> 02:36:20,000
That's it.

1638
02:36:20,000 --> 02:36:23,000
This is where we lose.

1639
02:36:23,000 --> 02:36:28,000
I only have 260,000.

1640
02:36:28,000 --> 02:36:31,000
It's going to be extremely difficult.

1641
02:36:31,000 --> 02:36:36,000
And you know how I do when it comes to like extremely difficult things.

1642
02:36:36,000 --> 02:36:39,000
Maybe we'll see.

1643
02:36:39,000 --> 02:36:41,000
What do we got there?

1644
02:36:41,000 --> 02:36:44,000
Let me look at the other ones.

1645
02:36:44,000 --> 02:36:46,000
Two repair ones.

1646
02:36:46,000 --> 02:36:47,000
Forget this one.

1647
02:36:47,000 --> 02:36:49,000
Two alarms and two repairs.

1648
02:36:49,000 --> 02:36:54,000
This one only has one alarm and one repair.

1649
02:36:54,000 --> 02:36:57,000
Look at all this stuff on this one.

1650
02:36:57,000 --> 02:37:04,000
Geez.

1651
02:37:04,000 --> 02:37:05,000
Did you do that?

1652
02:37:05,000 --> 02:37:07,000
Yes, I was the...

1653
02:37:07,000 --> 02:37:10,000
I'm the engineering in this game.

1654
02:37:10,000 --> 02:37:14,000
I'm like the tutorial and I tell you all kinds of things.

1655
02:37:14,000 --> 02:37:17,000
I teach you about how to play.

1656
02:37:17,000 --> 02:37:22,000
All that stuff.

1657
02:37:22,000 --> 02:37:24,000
Did you get my FOD email?

1658
02:37:24,000 --> 02:37:25,000
I did.

1659
02:37:25,000 --> 02:37:28,000
I opened it up and I immediately closed it.

1660
02:37:28,000 --> 02:37:30,000
You stunk up my office, dude.

1661
02:37:30,000 --> 02:37:35,000
Thanks.

1662
02:37:35,000 --> 02:37:37,000
Let's look at this.

1663
02:37:37,000 --> 02:37:42,000
Thankfully we don't have to deal with a sensor.

1664
02:37:42,000 --> 02:37:44,000
Seven minutes.

1665
02:37:44,000 --> 02:37:46,000
Shabba-batch.

1666
02:37:46,000 --> 02:37:50,000
Shabba-batch is all I gave you.

1667
02:37:50,000 --> 02:37:56,000
Only one repair, which is good, and it's right in the front door.

1668
02:37:56,000 --> 02:38:03,000
The juggernauts are a real huge issue if you're not taking out.

1669
02:38:03,000 --> 02:38:09,000
I think we're just going to have to go slow here and take out like every single thing in this whole area.

1670
02:38:09,000 --> 02:38:12,000
This whole part of the game here.

1671
02:38:12,000 --> 02:38:17,000
We're going to go down with it and then we're going to go up with it and then we're going to go right out this door.

1672
02:38:18,000 --> 02:38:23,000
And the landbam right into the core.

1673
02:38:23,000 --> 02:38:25,000
No, we are not.

1674
02:38:25,000 --> 02:38:26,000
We are not going to do that.

1675
02:38:26,000 --> 02:38:31,000
We're going to go here first because that's a nuclear device, which means in this tiny little cramped area,

1676
02:38:31,000 --> 02:38:36,000
if I destroy one of these, it makes a giant nuke explosion happen and we'll just kill you.

1677
02:38:36,000 --> 02:38:38,000
So we're going to go up there first.

1678
02:38:38,000 --> 02:38:41,000
Are there any more of those?

1679
02:38:41,000 --> 02:38:44,000
No.

1680
02:38:45,000 --> 02:38:48,000
So we got to go here.

1681
02:38:48,000 --> 02:38:51,000
Oh, you know what?

1682
02:38:51,000 --> 02:38:55,000
I could destroy this first and just get the hell out of here.

1683
02:38:55,000 --> 02:38:57,000
Come up here and then destroy that.

1684
02:38:57,000 --> 02:38:59,000
Which is, yeah, that's what I'm going to do.

1685
02:38:59,000 --> 02:39:01,000
That's a better idea because then I won't be able to repair.

1686
02:39:01,000 --> 02:39:04,000
I'm going to do that.

1687
02:39:04,000 --> 02:39:05,000
This is Cryptarch.

1688
02:39:05,000 --> 02:39:09,000
Did you just join us?

1689
02:39:09,000 --> 02:39:14,000
The point of the game is that you make a loadout, you go and you destroy the cores.

1690
02:39:14,000 --> 02:39:16,000
You have to destroy cores.

1691
02:39:16,000 --> 02:39:20,000
Everything's randomly, procedurally, procedurally generated.

1692
02:39:20,000 --> 02:39:23,000
I'm not a slagging.

1693
02:39:26,000 --> 02:39:27,000
Nice out of happening though.

1694
02:39:27,000 --> 02:39:28,000
There we go.

1695
02:39:28,000 --> 02:39:29,000
That was weird.

1696
02:39:29,000 --> 02:39:34,000
Everything's procedurally generated, which means you can get severely screwed.

1697
02:39:34,000 --> 02:39:38,000
Or, you know, it could be like a walk in the park.

1698
02:39:38,000 --> 02:39:40,000
This one shouldn't be too bad.

1699
02:39:40,000 --> 02:39:43,000
And I say that before we get going.

1700
02:39:43,000 --> 02:39:50,000
We all know how stuff like that goes though.

1701
02:39:50,000 --> 02:39:54,000
Where I'm really taking a big hurt hit here.

1702
02:39:54,000 --> 02:39:56,000
I'm not picking up enough tech upgrades.

1703
02:39:56,000 --> 02:39:59,000
So I'm stuck with the medium machine guns.

1704
02:39:59,000 --> 02:40:07,000
Which really, at this stage of the game, you need to be doing a lot more damage.

1705
02:40:07,000 --> 02:40:10,000
And all I've picked up, I've gotten all the shotguns.

1706
02:40:10,000 --> 02:40:16,000
But I'm not a fan of the shotguns unless it's like an assault shotgun.

1707
02:40:16,000 --> 02:40:25,000
I do have this though, which is thankfully really, really good.

1708
02:40:25,000 --> 02:40:27,000
Quick shield is hard to use.

1709
02:40:27,000 --> 02:40:30,000
So I don't want to use it in laser up.

1710
02:40:30,000 --> 02:40:35,000
I'm tempted to try the laser, but I don't think I want to, because I want to try to, like, at least get to the Cryptarch.

1711
02:40:35,000 --> 02:40:39,000
Maybe if that's possible, or at least get to like, I might just die here.

1712
02:40:39,000 --> 02:40:43,000
This is going to be really hard probably.

1713
02:40:43,000 --> 02:40:46,000
We're going to go with the zip gun though.

1714
02:40:46,000 --> 02:40:48,000
No, we aren't.

1715
02:40:48,000 --> 02:41:04,000
I need to save money.

1716
02:41:04,000 --> 02:41:06,000
I'll stay with the 50.

1717
02:41:06,000 --> 02:41:10,000
Those are so necessary to destroy the big tanky things.

1718
02:41:10,000 --> 02:41:13,000
I don't have two types of grenades, so they're staying.

1719
02:41:13,000 --> 02:41:17,000
And I'll keep the 5-5 and the key.

1720
02:41:17,000 --> 02:41:20,000
Never know when you're going to need a key.

1721
02:41:20,000 --> 02:41:24,000
Except not this time, because there's no locked doors that I need to go into.

1722
02:41:24,000 --> 02:41:28,000
If I go there up here, that's not locked.

1723
02:41:28,000 --> 02:41:32,000
This is also not locked, and none of these are locked.

1724
02:41:32,000 --> 02:41:37,000
So that key can kind of just go into trash.

1725
02:41:37,000 --> 02:41:42,000
Save myself a few thousand G's.

1726
02:41:42,000 --> 02:41:49,000
Oh.

1727
02:41:49,000 --> 02:41:51,000
I like that sounds really cool.

1728
02:41:51,000 --> 02:41:55,000
I shoot more, and they're more accurate.

1729
02:41:55,000 --> 02:42:01,000
For 15 grand, well, we kind of have to put all of our money in the pot anyways, because if I lose here, I pretty much lose the game.

1730
02:42:02,000 --> 02:42:05,000
Do you need good PC specs to run this?

1731
02:42:05,000 --> 02:42:07,000
I don't think so.

1732
02:42:07,000 --> 02:42:15,000
The only problem that this game has is, like, what happened the last time is it's a very precise game that you need to be paying a lot of attention to.

1733
02:42:15,000 --> 02:42:19,000
And sometimes the game will just hang, you know, that typical, like,

1734
02:42:19,000 --> 02:42:25,000
of the game just kind of stops for like two seconds, and it will get killed.

1735
02:42:25,000 --> 02:42:31,000
Even if that happens for like a quarter of a second, a game like this that requires like a quarter of a second reflexes,

1736
02:42:31,000 --> 02:42:37,000
that like, it screw you up, then it happens in this game.

1737
02:42:37,000 --> 02:42:40,000
But they're probably going to iron that out.

1738
02:42:40,000 --> 02:42:44,000
It is early access, so they're, I'm sure they're doing all kind of bug fixes and stuff.

1739
02:42:44,000 --> 02:42:46,000
It is a very, very, very fun game.

1740
02:42:46,000 --> 02:42:49,000
Extremely difficult, but very, very, very fun.

1741
02:42:49,000 --> 02:42:51,000
Let's stop talking about it.

1742
02:42:51,000 --> 02:42:52,000
Let's just show it.

1743
02:42:52,000 --> 02:42:53,000
Let's take a look, huh?

1744
02:42:53,000 --> 02:42:54,000
Whoa.

1745
02:42:54,000 --> 02:42:56,000
I don't think I've even seen the enemy before.

1746
02:42:56,000 --> 02:42:58,000
It's like a Reaper.

1747
02:42:58,000 --> 02:43:00,000
Fucking mine, right off the bat.

1748
02:43:00,000 --> 02:43:01,000
Two mines.

1749
02:43:01,000 --> 02:43:03,000
There's a room full of mines.

1750
02:43:03,000 --> 02:43:05,000
That's what that was, a room full of mines.

1751
02:43:05,000 --> 02:43:08,000
Slow calm down, calm down, calm it down.

1752
02:43:17,000 --> 02:43:18,000
Great!

1753
02:43:19,000 --> 02:43:23,000
Stick me in a room with eight mines in it in the front door.

1754
02:43:28,000 --> 02:43:31,000
Now I'm minus four health.

1755
02:43:40,000 --> 02:43:43,000
Now I got to be even more careful.

1756
02:43:44,000 --> 02:43:48,000
All right, there's a tech upgrade up there.

1757
02:43:50,000 --> 02:43:52,000
Alarm Laura, I don't need that.

1758
02:43:52,000 --> 02:43:53,000
I don't need that.

1759
02:44:14,000 --> 02:44:16,000
That's the detonator, right?

1760
02:44:16,000 --> 02:44:18,000
That's the Juggernaut factory.

1761
02:44:18,000 --> 02:44:20,000
I do not want to be killing that.

1762
02:44:20,000 --> 02:44:22,000
I've got to go down and around.

1763
02:44:22,000 --> 02:44:24,000
I'm going to go through the huge guy, great.

1764
02:44:24,000 --> 02:44:26,000
Still going to go this way.

1765
02:44:30,000 --> 02:44:32,000
Okay, I got to go.

1766
02:44:33,000 --> 02:44:35,000
Fucking mine!

1767
02:44:35,000 --> 02:44:36,000
Another mine!

1768
02:44:36,000 --> 02:44:38,000
Get out of the way!

1769
02:44:41,000 --> 02:44:42,000
Should've got that key!

1770
02:44:42,000 --> 02:44:44,000
Should've got that key!

1771
02:44:44,000 --> 02:44:47,000
Should've got that damn key!

1772
02:44:47,000 --> 02:44:49,000
Remember I said it didn't need a key?

1773
02:44:49,000 --> 02:44:50,000
Oh!

1774
02:44:52,000 --> 02:44:54,000
At least it's gone.

1775
02:44:54,000 --> 02:44:57,000
I feel like this is going to save Haven down here.

1776
02:45:05,000 --> 02:45:06,000
Mine.

1777
02:45:08,000 --> 02:45:10,000
All right, this is a drone factory.

1778
02:45:10,000 --> 02:45:11,000
It's going to do the explosion.

1779
02:45:11,000 --> 02:45:14,000
I can actually outrun it if I go all the way up.

1780
02:45:14,000 --> 02:45:15,000
I'm going to go for it.

1781
02:45:15,000 --> 02:45:17,000
The parastation is dead.

1782
02:45:21,000 --> 02:45:24,000
Let me get all the stuff that's down here that I need.

1783
02:45:25,000 --> 02:45:28,000
Rail cannon, I don't even know what that is.

1784
02:45:31,000 --> 02:45:32,000
Here comes the Juggernaut.

1785
02:45:32,000 --> 02:45:34,000
That's a dead end.

1786
02:45:34,000 --> 02:45:36,000
You shitbag!

1787
02:45:42,000 --> 02:45:44,000
Okay, come down.

1788
02:45:49,000 --> 02:45:51,000
Let's go get rid of that thing up there.

1789
02:45:55,000 --> 02:45:58,000
That will stop the buildings from exploding.

1790
02:45:58,000 --> 02:46:02,000
Hopefully, that would be great.

1791
02:46:05,000 --> 02:46:07,000
There's no mines in the front door.

1792
02:46:07,000 --> 02:46:10,000
Inside the fucking sealant vent.

1793
02:46:12,000 --> 02:46:15,000
Oh, my god, these mines are going to drive me crazy.

1794
02:46:16,000 --> 02:46:17,000
Something.

1795
02:46:17,000 --> 02:46:20,000
Oh, my god, these mines are going to drive me crazy.

1796
02:46:37,000 --> 02:46:39,000
You can't even see.

1797
02:46:39,000 --> 02:46:41,000
I'd like to see.

1798
02:46:46,000 --> 02:46:49,000
I'm not going to get that yet.

1799
02:46:49,000 --> 02:46:51,000
There's a Juggernaut in here.

1800
02:46:52,000 --> 02:46:55,000
There's a Juggernaut in here with me.

1801
02:46:56,000 --> 02:46:58,000
There's two Juggernauts in here.

1802
02:46:59,000 --> 02:47:02,000
Oh, what a mess.

1803
02:47:03,000 --> 02:47:04,000
There's nowhere I can go.

1804
02:47:04,000 --> 02:47:06,000
I have to get that repair.

1805
02:47:06,000 --> 02:47:08,000
I got to get this.

1806
02:47:09,000 --> 02:47:10,000
What?

1807
02:47:11,000 --> 02:47:12,000
Jump dead.

1808
02:47:12,000 --> 02:47:13,000
Jump dead.

1809
02:47:14,000 --> 02:47:15,000
Yeah, I'm dead.

1810
02:47:15,000 --> 02:47:18,000
Two Juggernauts in a tiny little room with all these explosions.

1811
02:47:18,000 --> 02:47:19,000
Game over.

1812
02:47:21,000 --> 02:47:23,000
Holy shit, that was impossible.

1813
02:47:25,000 --> 02:47:29,000
Without any more ammo in that cannon by default machine gun.

1814
02:47:29,000 --> 02:47:32,000
GG. There's no way I was beating that one.

1815
02:47:34,000 --> 02:47:39,000
If you're curious, the Juggernauts spawn every minute, I think, or every two minutes.

1816
02:47:39,000 --> 02:47:42,000
If you don't destroy the Juggernaut towns.

1817
02:47:44,000 --> 02:47:45,000
And they take...

1818
02:47:45,000 --> 02:47:49,000
It's pretty much a giant tank that has explosions that shoot out of it.

1819
02:47:49,000 --> 02:47:51,000
And they were just two things.

1820
02:47:51,000 --> 02:47:54,000
They were two of them in that room.

1821
02:47:56,000 --> 02:47:57,000
And there was no escaping them.

1822
02:47:57,000 --> 02:47:58,000
The turret's all over the walls.

1823
02:47:58,000 --> 02:47:59,000
Shit.

1824
02:48:03,000 --> 02:48:04,000
Well, I lost.

1825
02:48:04,000 --> 02:48:05,000
Game over.

1826
02:48:09,000 --> 02:48:11,000
There's Cryptarch.

1827
02:48:15,000 --> 02:48:18,000
So I got to two before the Cryptarch before I died.

1828
02:48:22,000 --> 02:48:24,000
But that's the worst part, right?

1829
02:48:24,000 --> 02:48:29,000
So there's like ten different building types in this game.

1830
02:48:30,000 --> 02:48:33,000
They're all horrible, right?

1831
02:48:33,000 --> 02:48:35,000
You have to pick you a poison in this game.

1832
02:48:36,000 --> 02:48:37,000
You either like...

1833
02:48:38,000 --> 02:48:40,000
Like for instance, those two Juggernauts...

1834
02:48:40,000 --> 02:48:42,000
The Juggernaut stations, or whatever you want to call them.

1835
02:48:43,000 --> 02:48:45,000
If I went and got those first,

1836
02:48:45,000 --> 02:48:48,000
the nuclear explosion was still what happened.

1837
02:48:48,000 --> 02:48:51,000
If I didn't, you know, if you don't get the nuclear explosion,

1838
02:48:51,000 --> 02:48:55,000
building destroyed, then you screw in...

1839
02:48:55,000 --> 02:48:57,000
Every way you're screwing yourself in this game.

1840
02:48:57,000 --> 02:49:00,000
You have to like pick which one you'd rather deal with.

1841
02:49:01,000 --> 02:49:04,000
So, and you saw right there,

1842
02:49:04,000 --> 02:49:06,000
I decided to try to get rid of the nukes

1843
02:49:06,000 --> 02:49:08,000
because they take up like the whole screen.

1844
02:49:09,000 --> 02:49:11,000
And I left the Juggernaut stations,

1845
02:49:11,000 --> 02:49:13,000
and then two of them were in the same room with me.

1846
02:49:13,000 --> 02:49:15,000
And then you just die.

1847
02:49:15,000 --> 02:49:17,000
Because if there's that many in a small area

1848
02:49:17,000 --> 02:49:19,000
and they just shoot the explosive, the fucking bombs.

1849
02:49:24,000 --> 02:49:25,000
But yeah, that's Cryptarch.

1850
02:49:25,000 --> 02:49:27,000
That did voice acting work for this game.

1851
02:49:27,000 --> 02:49:28,000
It's really fun.

1852
02:49:28,000 --> 02:49:30,000
It's just excruciatingly difficult.

1853
02:49:32,000 --> 02:49:35,000
If you're into that sort of thing, I highly recommend it.

1854
02:49:38,000 --> 02:49:40,000
You can... I would not recommend playing this game from bed.

1855
02:49:44,000 --> 02:49:46,000
Playing this game from bed would probably be a pretty bad idea.

1856
02:49:47,000 --> 02:49:48,000
You might die.

1857
02:49:53,000 --> 02:49:55,000
There are angels in the Elfield, bro. You gotta believe.

1858
02:49:59,000 --> 02:50:01,000
Alright, let me switch to this for a second.

1859
02:50:10,000 --> 02:50:12,000
I'm probably gonna do a video on it.

1860
02:50:12,000 --> 02:50:17,000
I might do a video on this game showing like the character

1861
02:50:17,000 --> 02:50:19,000
that I'm doing and stuff.

1862
02:50:19,000 --> 02:50:21,000
Talk about it for a few minutes, maybe.

1863
02:50:22,000 --> 02:50:24,000
Okay, let's close out the stream a little bit of...

1864
02:50:24,000 --> 02:50:25,000
It's only $11, too.

1865
02:50:30,000 --> 02:50:32,000
Now, hold on, Grover, man.

1866
02:50:32,000 --> 02:50:33,000
You gotta hold on one second.

1867
02:50:48,000 --> 02:50:50,000
Cryptarch, very fun.

1868
02:50:50,000 --> 02:50:52,000
It's just a very dice-roly.

1869
02:50:54,000 --> 02:50:58,000
You saw some of those places that had like, you know, almost every door was locked

1870
02:50:58,000 --> 02:50:59,000
and I didn't have enough keys.

1871
02:50:59,000 --> 02:51:01,000
And I kind of just had to run around like a check with my head cut off.

1872
02:51:06,000 --> 02:51:07,000
What the fuck is that?

1873
02:51:10,000 --> 02:51:12,000
Did I get tractor just drive by my window?

1874
02:51:15,000 --> 02:51:17,000
Did some dude do it like a tractor just drove by?

1875
02:51:21,000 --> 02:51:24,000
Alright, I'm gonna...

1876
02:51:24,000 --> 02:51:26,000
I'll close out the stream with a little bit of TF2.

1877
02:51:34,000 --> 02:51:35,000
Why not, right?

1878
02:51:35,000 --> 02:51:37,000
I need to beat that Cryptarch, though.

1879
02:51:37,000 --> 02:51:38,000
I will.

1880
02:51:38,000 --> 02:51:40,000
I will beat the Cryptarch one day.

1881
02:52:06,000 --> 02:52:08,000
You gotta change my stream title.

1882
02:52:11,000 --> 02:52:12,000
Thanks for hanging out.

1883
02:52:12,000 --> 02:52:13,000
Those of you that are here.

1884
02:52:13,000 --> 02:52:15,000
If it's early, early in the morning for you.

1885
02:52:15,000 --> 02:52:17,000
Thanks for chilling.

1886
02:52:28,000 --> 02:52:30,000
Well, I try to reset my sleep schedule.

1887
02:52:30,000 --> 02:52:31,000
Thanks.

1888
02:52:36,000 --> 02:52:38,000
I'm gonna go back to sleep.

1889
02:52:48,000 --> 02:52:49,000
Hold on a second.

1890
02:52:53,000 --> 02:52:54,000
Okay.

1891
02:52:54,000 --> 02:52:58,000
I mean, load up that game that we're talking about.

1892
02:53:02,000 --> 02:53:03,000
Fortress team.

1893
02:53:06,000 --> 02:53:10,000
Does this mean no Euro streams when you reset the schedule?

1894
02:53:10,000 --> 02:53:11,000
No.

1895
02:53:11,000 --> 02:53:12,000
Not necessarily.

1896
02:53:12,000 --> 02:53:14,000
It just means that...

1897
02:53:14,000 --> 02:53:16,000
That is gonna be random times, you know.

1898
02:53:16,000 --> 02:53:18,000
It might be two o'clock in the morning.

1899
02:53:18,000 --> 02:53:20,000
It might be two p.m., I don't know.

1900
02:53:36,000 --> 02:53:37,000
Change this.

1901
02:53:41,000 --> 02:53:43,000
Give me a second, guys.

1902
02:53:49,000 --> 02:53:51,000
Dung!

1903
02:53:55,000 --> 02:53:57,000
Where it is gonna go here.

1904
02:53:59,000 --> 02:54:01,000
I don't need to play anything in particular.

1905
02:54:01,000 --> 02:54:03,000
I just kinda wanna unwind for a little bit.

1906
02:54:06,000 --> 02:54:07,000
I just wanna unwind.

1907
02:54:23,000 --> 02:54:25,000
Now that I know it's a black screen, I'm sorry.

1908
02:54:25,000 --> 02:54:27,000
I'm sorry about the black screen.

1909
02:54:36,000 --> 02:54:40,000
Well, incoming Chrome, that sounds like a real big problem.

1910
02:54:44,000 --> 02:54:47,000
He might wanna call your local doctor's office and ask them...

1911
02:54:49,000 --> 02:54:52,000
What your course of action should probably be?

1912
02:55:06,000 --> 02:55:08,000
Okay, we're gonna...

1913
02:55:08,000 --> 02:55:11,000
I'm just gonna be a demo night freak.

1914
02:55:14,000 --> 02:55:15,000
Demo freak show.

1915
02:55:24,000 --> 02:55:27,000
That was a Windows 7 game, you know what?

1916
02:55:28,000 --> 02:55:29,000
I don't have Windows 7.

1917
02:55:29,000 --> 02:55:30,000
You don't...

1918
02:55:30,000 --> 02:55:34,000
I keep accidentally clicking on the Windows 10 thing.

1919
02:55:35,000 --> 02:55:36,000
I don't wanna do it.

1920
02:55:36,000 --> 02:55:37,000
Not yet.

1921
02:55:38,000 --> 02:55:42,000
And every time I go down to my taskbar, I end up accidentally having to sit through that loading screen.

1922
02:55:48,000 --> 02:55:50,000
It's probably not a good idea to do this on this map.

1923
02:55:52,000 --> 02:55:53,000
On offense.

1924
02:55:53,000 --> 02:55:54,000
Full demo night.

1925
02:55:54,000 --> 02:55:56,000
That's not a good idea.

1926
02:56:00,000 --> 02:56:02,000
Oh god, the unlock of Buser, damn.

1927
02:56:05,000 --> 02:56:07,000
How about we sit in forever?

1928
02:56:07,000 --> 02:56:08,000
Let's go.

1929
02:56:08,000 --> 02:56:10,000
I wish there was a way you could speed up the setup time.

1930
02:56:10,000 --> 02:56:13,000
Like, hold F and the speed up, it'll speed it up.

1931
02:56:18,000 --> 02:56:19,000
It's part of a spy.

1932
02:56:24,000 --> 02:56:26,000
Sojour on this car, I think.

1933
02:56:29,000 --> 02:56:31,000
Your spy seemed like you are.

1934
02:56:36,000 --> 02:56:38,000
Oh, that was bad.

1935
02:56:41,000 --> 02:56:43,000
I just like shot me in the wrong direction.

1936
02:56:51,000 --> 02:56:53,000
Yeah, I'm just doing this on wide.

1937
02:56:54,000 --> 02:56:56,000
I'm just doing this to unzip, you know.

1938
02:56:58,000 --> 02:56:59,000
Maybe we should really get...

1939
02:56:59,000 --> 02:57:00,000
No, maybe it could be 10 minutes.

1940
02:57:00,000 --> 02:57:02,000
We could be like an hour.

1941
02:57:02,000 --> 02:57:03,000
We'll find out, right?

1942
02:57:06,000 --> 02:57:08,000
We'll find out, won't we?

1943
02:57:19,000 --> 02:57:20,000
Anybody in here?

1944
02:57:23,000 --> 02:57:25,000
I'm always so scared to turn this corner because of right there.

1945
02:57:25,000 --> 02:57:26,000
There's always a century there.

1946
02:57:30,000 --> 02:57:31,000
We're way far ahead now.

1947
02:57:36,000 --> 02:57:37,000
Doo!

1948
02:57:45,000 --> 02:57:46,000
Where the hell is red team?

1949
02:57:48,000 --> 02:57:49,000
What's going on?

1950
02:57:49,000 --> 02:57:50,000
Are we just moving together?

1951
02:57:50,000 --> 02:57:51,000
Is anybody on the other team?

1952
02:57:56,000 --> 02:57:57,000
Okay.

1953
02:58:00,000 --> 02:58:01,000
Why would that far?

1954
02:58:01,000 --> 02:58:03,000
Like, are we that far ahead?

1955
02:58:05,000 --> 02:58:06,000
I guess we were.

1956
02:58:16,000 --> 02:58:17,000
Yeah, I was moving.

1957
02:58:17,000 --> 02:58:18,000
I keep thinking that, dude.

1958
02:58:18,000 --> 02:58:19,000
It's a spy.

1959
02:58:21,000 --> 02:58:22,000
Every time.

1960
02:58:24,000 --> 02:58:26,000
I don't know if we're just rolling them right now, but...

1961
02:58:27,000 --> 02:58:29,000
I've seen like two people on red this whole time.

1962
02:58:29,000 --> 02:58:30,000
One of them was that part of...

1963
02:58:31,000 --> 02:58:33,000
What the hell is that guy doing?

1964
02:58:36,000 --> 02:58:37,000
This is...

1965
02:58:44,000 --> 02:58:45,000
Okay.

1966
02:58:49,000 --> 02:58:50,000
Watch out for this guy.

1967
02:58:50,000 --> 02:58:51,000
He's got like arms.

1968
02:58:51,000 --> 02:58:53,000
What is happening with this dude?

1969
02:58:55,000 --> 02:58:56,000
He's got arms coming out of his back.

1970
02:58:56,000 --> 02:58:57,000
He's got four arms.

1971
02:58:58,000 --> 02:59:01,000
And he's about to stick that spy cycle in his own...

1972
02:59:01,000 --> 02:59:02,000
...boy.

1973
02:59:02,000 --> 02:59:03,000
Yeah.

1974
02:59:05,000 --> 02:59:06,000
Uh...

1975
02:59:06,000 --> 02:59:08,000
Let's go on red.

1976
02:59:09,000 --> 02:59:10,000
This is what's happening.

1977
02:59:10,000 --> 02:59:11,000
Okay.

1978
02:59:17,000 --> 02:59:18,000
Holy shit.

1979
02:59:20,000 --> 02:59:21,000
Is that two FLOG pyros?

1980
02:59:24,000 --> 02:59:25,000
Is that guy for Crits?

1981
02:59:25,000 --> 02:59:26,000
Okay.

1982
02:59:26,000 --> 02:59:27,000
I know that was fine.

1983
02:59:33,000 --> 02:59:35,000
I was doing the box...

1984
02:59:35,000 --> 02:59:37,000
...tongue with the boxes and showing.

1985
02:59:40,000 --> 02:59:41,000
Time.

1986
02:59:46,000 --> 02:59:48,000
Well, that was a crazy round, I guess.

1987
02:59:49,000 --> 02:59:51,000
I saw three people on red team.

1988
02:59:52,000 --> 02:59:53,000
And then I went to red team.

1989
02:59:54,000 --> 02:59:57,000
And then I was locked in by FLOG Geistinator pyros.

1990
02:59:59,000 --> 03:00:00,000
Stop distancing it once.

1991
03:00:01,000 --> 03:00:02,000
Stop distancing it once.

1992
03:00:07,000 --> 03:00:08,000
Oh, how childish.

1993
03:00:08,000 --> 03:00:10,000
How childish I'm gonna be dancing.

1994
03:00:16,000 --> 03:00:17,000
Fucking childish.

1995
03:00:26,000 --> 03:00:28,000
FLOG pyros are the true evil in this game.

1996
03:00:31,000 --> 03:00:32,000
Nah, I wouldn't say that.

1997
03:00:38,000 --> 03:00:40,000
So, is that a pyro?

1998
03:00:40,000 --> 03:00:42,000
And is that an engineer in a pyro?

1999
03:00:42,000 --> 03:00:44,000
Who's two hands of those?

2000
03:00:48,000 --> 03:00:50,000
Yeah, who's hands of those?

2001
03:00:50,000 --> 03:00:52,000
No, that's a heavy in an engineer.

2002
03:00:52,000 --> 03:00:53,000
Is it heavy in pyro?

2003
03:00:53,000 --> 03:00:56,000
I forget all the default loadouts look like.

2004
03:00:56,000 --> 03:00:58,000
Sorry, I'll get you next time.

2005
03:01:01,000 --> 03:01:02,000
Oh.

2006
03:01:14,000 --> 03:01:16,000
Hey, hey, quick dancing, man.

2007
03:01:16,000 --> 03:01:18,000
There's like shit going on outside.

2008
03:01:19,000 --> 03:01:21,000
Look, there's a battle going on.

2009
03:01:23,000 --> 03:01:25,000
We're under attack by red team.

2010
03:01:25,000 --> 03:01:27,000
There's no time to be dancing, I spawn.

2011
03:01:31,000 --> 03:01:33,000
Okay, well, you're over there.

2012
03:01:39,000 --> 03:01:40,000
I'm as an engineer.

2013
03:01:41,000 --> 03:01:42,000
No moving.

2014
03:01:57,000 --> 03:02:00,000
This is this pyro blow and flames in my face.

2015
03:02:02,000 --> 03:02:03,000
Okay.

2016
03:02:11,000 --> 03:02:13,000
I wish I could hit a shot, that would be great.

2017
03:02:16,000 --> 03:02:18,000
Oh boy, I'm being surrounded.

2018
03:02:33,000 --> 03:02:34,000
Centry?

2019
03:02:34,000 --> 03:02:35,000
Maybe? Centry?

2020
03:02:35,000 --> 03:02:36,000
Maybe?

2021
03:02:36,000 --> 03:02:37,000
No.

2022
03:02:41,000 --> 03:02:43,000
You want to try to stare at me?

2023
03:02:46,000 --> 03:02:48,000
Are we going to try to do?

2024
03:02:48,000 --> 03:02:50,000
Come on now, where'd you go?

2025
03:02:54,000 --> 03:02:55,000
Aha!

2026
03:03:01,000 --> 03:03:04,000
The night is seriously going to step right in my face.

2027
03:03:04,000 --> 03:03:05,000
Come on now.

2028
03:03:05,000 --> 03:03:12,000
I was trying to avoid that as best I could, it still didn't work.

2029
03:03:26,000 --> 03:03:28,000
Team fortress two.

2030
03:03:36,000 --> 03:03:38,000
What's happening right now?

2031
03:03:41,000 --> 03:03:44,000
My brain is kind of on ice right now.

2032
03:03:44,000 --> 03:03:46,000
I still haven't gone to bed.

2033
03:03:46,000 --> 03:03:48,000
I still haven't gone to bed.

2034
03:03:54,000 --> 03:03:55,000
I think I was just...

2035
03:04:03,000 --> 03:04:04,000
Shit.

2036
03:04:06,000 --> 03:04:07,000
I gotta play something.

2037
03:04:07,000 --> 03:04:10,000
What requires like zero brain power?

2038
03:04:16,000 --> 03:04:18,000
When did I go to bed last?

2039
03:04:18,000 --> 03:04:19,000
I remember.

2040
03:04:21,000 --> 03:04:23,000
I think it was like...

2041
03:04:23,000 --> 03:04:26,000
3 or 4 am yesterday?

2042
03:04:26,000 --> 03:04:28,000
Day before, whatever it was.

2043
03:04:29,000 --> 03:04:30,000
I don't remember.

2044
03:04:30,000 --> 03:04:32,000
Dude, it's like memento.

2045
03:04:32,000 --> 03:04:34,000
I don't have like no memories.

2046
03:04:36,000 --> 03:04:37,000
Dude!

2047
03:04:40,000 --> 03:04:42,000
I have a sandwich, I don't think so.

2048
03:04:51,000 --> 03:04:52,000
Oh shit.

2049
03:04:58,000 --> 03:05:01,000
Hey, when life gives you lemons...

2050
03:05:03,000 --> 03:05:04,000
Play heavy.

2051
03:05:06,000 --> 03:05:08,000
You still alive.

2052
03:05:08,000 --> 03:05:11,000
Maybe I'll take a knife in my face.

2053
03:05:19,000 --> 03:05:21,000
Don't get me, don't get me.

2054
03:05:36,000 --> 03:05:38,000
Where did he go?

2055
03:05:41,000 --> 03:05:43,000
There he is.

2056
03:05:49,000 --> 03:05:50,000
Nobody's on the car.

2057
03:05:50,000 --> 03:05:52,000
The car's just all the way back there.

2058
03:05:56,000 --> 03:05:58,000
What do you say, do a what?

2059
03:05:58,000 --> 03:05:59,000
Do a triple...

2060
03:06:00,000 --> 03:06:04,000
Do a triple chin chair engee for the end of the stream.

2061
03:06:06,000 --> 03:06:08,000
Do it again.

2062
03:06:08,000 --> 03:06:10,000
Do it again, get me again.

2063
03:06:10,000 --> 03:06:12,000
Holy shit, there's another one.

2064
03:06:14,000 --> 03:06:16,000
Come on, come on, which one of you wants it?

2065
03:06:16,000 --> 03:06:18,000
Which one of you wants to get me?

2066
03:06:18,000 --> 03:06:19,000
Huh?

2067
03:06:19,000 --> 03:06:20,000
Which one?

2068
03:06:28,000 --> 03:06:30,000
I wanted to punch that guy.

2069
03:06:36,000 --> 03:06:38,000
I'm not going to die.

2070
03:06:38,000 --> 03:06:40,000
I'm not going to die.

2071
03:06:40,000 --> 03:06:42,000
I'm not going to die.

2072
03:06:42,000 --> 03:06:44,000
I'm not going to die.

2073
03:06:44,000 --> 03:06:46,000
I'm not going to die.

2074
03:06:46,000 --> 03:06:48,000
I'm not going to die.

2075
03:06:52,000 --> 03:06:55,000
I skipped school to watch this.

2076
03:06:55,000 --> 03:06:57,000
Don't do that.

2077
03:06:57,000 --> 03:06:59,000
No, it's skipped school.

2078
03:06:59,000 --> 03:07:02,000
The stream's ending in like 10 minutes.

2079
03:07:02,000 --> 03:07:04,000
I really hope that's a joke.

2080
03:07:06,000 --> 03:07:07,000
Oh, here we go.

2081
03:07:07,000 --> 03:07:08,000
I skipped school.

2082
03:07:08,000 --> 03:07:09,000
That's like, get out the popcorn.

2083
03:07:09,000 --> 03:07:11,000
I'm going to watch this live stream.

2084
03:07:11,000 --> 03:07:14,000
It's just a- it ended the stream.

2085
03:07:15,000 --> 03:07:18,000
All right, so when that happens, just go to school.

2086
03:07:18,000 --> 03:07:21,000
And just like, go with like a tardy notice.

2087
03:07:28,000 --> 03:07:30,000
Be like, I couldn't find my shoes.

2088
03:07:30,000 --> 03:07:32,000
That's a good excuse.

2089
03:07:33,000 --> 03:07:34,000
What teacher can argue that?

2090
03:07:36,000 --> 03:07:37,000
You know what I mean?

2091
03:07:37,000 --> 03:07:38,000
Going to school late?

2092
03:07:38,000 --> 03:07:40,000
Walk up to the front desk?

2093
03:07:40,000 --> 03:07:42,000
Hey, I'm here. I'm late.

2094
03:07:42,000 --> 03:07:45,000
Okay, well, sweetie, why are you late?

2095
03:07:47,000 --> 03:07:49,000
I couldn't find my shoes.

2096
03:07:50,000 --> 03:07:51,000
Oh.

2097
03:07:51,000 --> 03:07:54,000
Okay, well, you found them, obviously.

2098
03:07:54,000 --> 03:07:55,000
You found them.

2099
03:07:55,000 --> 03:07:58,000
Yeah, I found them, but I couldn't find them before.

2100
03:07:59,000 --> 03:08:02,000
Okay, well, please go to class.

2101
03:08:03,000 --> 03:08:04,000
How are you going to argue that?

2102
03:08:06,000 --> 03:08:08,000
What are you going to say about that?

2103
03:08:15,000 --> 03:08:16,000
Okay, that's going to be right behind me.

2104
03:08:16,000 --> 03:08:17,000
And he's second now.

2105
03:08:22,000 --> 03:08:23,000
He's right next to me.

2106
03:08:23,000 --> 03:08:24,000
I want to try to get the medic.

2107
03:08:24,000 --> 03:08:25,000
I'm not going to be able to.

2108
03:08:27,000 --> 03:08:29,000
I'm so paranoid of those two.

2109
03:08:29,000 --> 03:08:31,000
Trying to shoot my own guys.

2110
03:08:36,000 --> 03:08:38,000
Oh, stay heavy. Why not?

2111
03:08:38,000 --> 03:08:40,000
I'm so tired at this point.

2112
03:08:40,000 --> 03:08:42,000
I'm playing anything else.

2113
03:08:42,000 --> 03:08:43,000
This is a bad idea.

2114
03:08:44,000 --> 03:08:46,000
I'm a little bit of just walk the runway.

2115
03:08:46,000 --> 03:08:47,000
Hey, you!

2116
03:08:54,000 --> 03:08:55,000
Coming for you.

2117
03:08:55,000 --> 03:08:58,000
I'm going to be able to get the medic.

2118
03:08:58,000 --> 03:09:00,000
I'm going to be able to get the medic.

2119
03:09:00,000 --> 03:09:02,000
I'm going to be able to get the medic.

2120
03:09:02,000 --> 03:09:03,000
I'm going to be able to get the medic.

2121
03:09:04,000 --> 03:09:05,000
Coming for you.

2122
03:09:06,000 --> 03:09:07,000
Coming for you.

2123
03:09:13,000 --> 03:09:15,000
You saw the flash light?

2124
03:09:15,000 --> 03:09:16,000
You saw the flash last night.

2125
03:09:19,000 --> 03:09:21,000
The flash movie or the flash like TV.

2126
03:09:21,000 --> 03:09:22,000
Isn't there a flash TV show?

2127
03:09:30,000 --> 03:09:32,000
It's so close.

2128
03:09:32,000 --> 03:09:33,000
Somebody get on it.

2129
03:09:36,000 --> 03:09:37,000
Let's go this way.

2130
03:09:51,000 --> 03:09:52,000
Oh shit.

2131
03:09:57,000 --> 03:09:59,000
I skipped my breakfast to this.

2132
03:10:03,000 --> 03:10:05,000
I'm just going to punch a guy.

2133
03:10:05,000 --> 03:10:08,000
I'm just going to punch one guy and then I'm going to disconnect.

2134
03:10:11,000 --> 03:10:14,000
I would have punched that guy.

2135
03:10:14,000 --> 03:10:16,000
Oh, I did hit him.

2136
03:10:16,000 --> 03:10:18,000
I did punch him once.

2137
03:10:33,000 --> 03:10:35,000
I'm going to punch this guy.

2138
03:10:38,000 --> 03:10:40,000
Whoever comes out.

2139
03:10:44,000 --> 03:10:46,000
They're going to get punched.

2140
03:10:50,000 --> 03:10:53,000
How many scenes are we coming out of this way?

2141
03:10:54,000 --> 03:10:56,000
I'm going to punch him.

2142
03:11:00,000 --> 03:11:01,000
Punch him.

2143
03:11:07,000 --> 03:11:09,000
Punch this guy too.

2144
03:11:12,000 --> 03:11:13,000
Give me one.

2145
03:11:13,000 --> 03:11:15,000
I'm just top scoring apparently.

2146
03:11:20,000 --> 03:11:21,000
Who is this guy?

2147
03:11:21,000 --> 03:11:23,000
He sucks at team fortress.

2148
03:11:23,000 --> 03:11:24,000
Does he even play sixes?

2149
03:11:24,000 --> 03:11:26,000
No, I don't.

2150
03:11:26,000 --> 03:11:27,000
I don't play sixes.

2151
03:11:27,000 --> 03:11:28,000
Sorry.

2152
03:11:40,000 --> 03:11:41,000
Huh!

2153
03:11:47,000 --> 03:11:50,000
All right, I've been awake for like 20-some odd hours now.

2154
03:11:52,000 --> 03:12:02,000
Are they just trying to go to bed or eat food and try to relax and do something?

2155
03:12:05,000 --> 03:12:07,000
I wanted to stay up at least another few hours.

2156
03:12:18,000 --> 03:12:19,000
Go to bed.

2157
03:12:22,000 --> 03:12:24,000
I'm getting phone calls.

2158
03:12:30,000 --> 03:12:33,000
I'm going to answer this call.

2159
03:12:37,000 --> 03:12:39,000
There's just telephone call.

2160
03:12:40,000 --> 03:12:42,000
They'll call back.

2161
03:12:47,000 --> 03:12:49,000
It's pretty catchy ringtone.

2162
03:12:50,000 --> 03:12:52,000
I don't know how the fuck this is.

2163
03:13:00,000 --> 03:13:02,000
Oh, all right, but I, yeah, I'm going to take off guys.

2164
03:13:04,000 --> 03:13:06,000
It has been fun.

2165
03:13:06,000 --> 03:13:07,000
There's always.

2166
03:13:09,000 --> 03:13:12,000
I'm going to go try to work on a video at some point later tonight.

2167
03:13:13,000 --> 03:13:15,000
Maybe upload it tomorrow with the next day.

2168
03:13:16,000 --> 03:13:17,000
We'll see.

2169
03:13:18,000 --> 03:13:21,000
Yeah, I don't know if I'll complete me, boy.

2170
03:13:22,000 --> 03:13:25,000
I got to the end there kind of and I just decided to play Cryptarch.

2171
03:13:26,000 --> 03:13:28,000
And then got my ass kicked in Cryptarch, which is great.

2172
03:13:30,000 --> 03:13:32,000
But yeah, thanks for coming guys.

2173
03:13:32,000 --> 03:13:33,000
I love you.

2174
03:13:35,000 --> 03:13:36,000
Take it easy.

2175
03:13:37,000 --> 03:13:38,000
Have a good one.
