hey look it there we are

52
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:27,000
all right so what's the reason that I'm wondering what this is we're gonna just

53
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:37,000
just just sit here and enjoy this song I'm gonna enjoy this music is this the

54
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:47,000
like a rory music let me try it a little bit more you're about to play sport all right

55
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:56,000
well you can you listen to this how does this sound I thought you did the

56
00:05:56,000 --> 00:06:03,000
I thought you could have played mobile games no not today not it sounds it sounds

57
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:12,000
better now okay okay so Armour Crog if you don't know what what this is we'll

58
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:17,000
give a brief synopsis of this before we actually start playing the game this is

59
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:22,000
one of my favorite games of all time was a neverhood came out like 20 years

60
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:27,000
ago it's a claymation game it's a point and click you walk around you interact with

61
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:33,000
stuff is a lot of dialogue and this is the the guys it made Armour Crog I mean

62
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:39,000
the guy that made neverhood made this game this was a kickstarter game and it's

63
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:43,000
really awesome because the guys that made the original game came together finally

64
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:50,000
after a long time to make a new one so hopefully they still have like every

65
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:54,000
they still have the passion and they still have the creativity like they did 20

66
00:06:54,000 --> 00:07:11,000
years ago so we're gonna sit here for another five minutes maybe I'll turn up

67
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:22,000
the sound like during the cutscene maybe that should be better yeah yeah I was

68
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:26,000
listening to the volume yeah everything in general seems fine it's all a little

69
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:31,000
low people say I could barely hear but they don't understand that there's a

70
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:35,000
volume slider on the website twitch that television I'd look on the lower left

71
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:38,000
hand side of your screen you're gonna see a thing that looks like an old

72
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:42,000
tiny old-fashioned speaker that's not actually what speakers are really looking

73
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:46,000
like nowadays anymore but they still use that to help people understand you know

74
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:52,000
the same way there's a telephone all right so let's to cut you off this game

75
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:59,000
requires a pen and paper and I'm gonna say this right now I ain't speed running

76
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:03,000
this game I'm not going through this fast I want to enjoy this because I've been

77
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:09,000
waiting for like 20 years for this game to come up so I I might take a little

78
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:14,000
while in some places I might want to listen to songs and stuff like that so if

79
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:18,000
you're one of those people that's just like get on with it and do the puzzle

80
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:21,000
what are you doing you're probably not gonna you're probably gonna want to

81
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:29,000
just hang tight because this game is going to be like a chill I'm just gonna

82
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:33,000
play and run and hack up my little note pad here I could have scribbled some notes

83
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:37,000
on it and stuff you know how it is

84
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:44,000
yeah how many people are here like four like showed up I think you turned the

85
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:50,000
volume up by maybe just like the in-game volume you know like 10% boost then

86
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:55,000
no there's there's there's 10%

87
00:08:55,000 --> 00:09:00,000
we're looking we're looking quite keen you know oh but you better not talk to

88
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:05,000
any cutscenes if you speak during a cutscene I am just going to end I'm gonna

89
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:08,000
end the call I'm I'm just gonna get out of here the only thing I'm gonna say

90
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:14,000
during a cutscene that I'm not saying anything

91
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:23,000
all right so here we go that's your answer yeah I got my pen I got my paper I

92
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:26,000

93
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:31,000

102
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:27,000
there could be Carpacian rain stuckers

103
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:42,000
here we are beakeake what is this place got me I know this looks too hard I think I'd

104
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:45,000
stop here actually but I'm gonna do this because it probably would be a good idea

105
00:12:45,000 --> 00:13:00,000
let's turn on some subtitles that probably helped all right so this is me there's

106
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:08,000
Tommy not there's little dog okay I can click on the dog and move the dog around so you

107
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:13,000
control two characters in this game all right interesting well let's go pick up this

108
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:26,000
take a look outside yeah I am a little louder no no whatever I don't worry about it man

109
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:30,000
what the hell was that

110
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:42,000
haha all right I got I got to pay attention because the these guys the neverhood guys they put

111
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:47,000
random weird clues that you'll need like four hours from now in these rooms in these first

112
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:51,000
rooms if I remember from the last game there's a lot of wacky shit so

113
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:59,000
just take a look at some of the stuff over here I mean that was that was 20 years ago do you

114
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:03,000
think you're gonna need to know the information from 20 years ago that'd be cool if you did

115
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:08,000
and I can't click on this from the back of the box the cell number that looks like that looks

116
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:18,000
like a dog hole but you know okay I just bought here there we go okay easiest pie

117
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:31,000
this room is so cool I am gonna apologize in advance like I'm gonna take in every single room

118
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:38,000
what is that is that a piece of cheese it's like a fuzzy piece of cheese

119
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:50,000
I knew you'd come you've traveled far yet your true journey begins through the exit unseen

120
00:14:53,000 --> 00:15:00,000
okay anything else know this to open one door you must block another

121
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:12,000
as the beast blocks your entrance your exit shall appear okay can I do anything over here

122

00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:45,000
what's that what did I just eat

135
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:50,000
shit I should have paid attention with the way I just ate something I don't know what the hell it was

136
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:57,000
I'm gonna come out the doggy door right yeah first control I there's another symbol right

137
00:16:57,000 --> 00:17:00,000
this one down there's another symbol what I wait a hold on a second

138
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:04,000
uh it's a box

139
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:12,000
all right a little swirly in the middle and then two squares next to it

140
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:21,000
can you do it can you do anything else can I go walk in now this door is closed

141
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:28,000
jelly roll that's a good day for it yeah jelly roll looks like the end of an arm chair

142
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:33,000
yes me dude kind of does he's not tall enough to grab that but

143
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:44,000
okay I got another symbol though so that's good to know now is this because the light is on

144
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:48,000
what are the lights off because I don't think I can switch back to Tommy not

145
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:55,000
what happens if I turn let's put the light on and try that again but

146
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:58,000
oh he just puked up a lever oh shit

147
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:04,000
uh I just ate it again

148
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:17,000
what does the second lever go oh no this you okay there's a lever in this next room

149
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:23,000
over here I remember I remember there it is

150
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:37,000
so that opens that door that door I couldn't open before I can push this fuzzy guy I love this character by the way

00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:42,000
the fuzzy guy yeah well what what the fuck

155
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:11,000
I kind of feel like I need to click this greetings friend I am Abraham Lincoln

156
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:17,000
one two

157
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:24,000
there was one two one two three one I'm gonna see that again hold on

158
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:26,000
Ant Lincoln

159
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:34,000
two three one okay Ant Lincoln

160
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:42,000
two three one was there anything else in there what what what what what what what what should

161
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:51,000
what one two three four five lines I have no idea what this means I'm sure maybe the

162
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:59,000
later I'll figure it out what's the significance you think of him being the tallest American

163
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:04,000
president um white quite the stature even without the other top idol for James Madison

164
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:12,000
James Madison five four really didn't stand up to anything Abraham Lincoln had accomplished

165
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:18,000
I say politicians have to be tall I think you're gonna have to be tall to do one of these puzzles

166
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:22,000
yeah yeah I'm not I don't think I'm tall enough to do this puzzle

167
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:32,000
well this obviously correlates to the ant guy so I mean I see a couple top charts on that top

168
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:44,000
row you're scrolling by any of these symbols guard chair was on the top row yeah I thought it

169
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:52,000
was two but does that mean anything this is the only role that's lit up

170
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:59,000
well can't you push them down who's the ups and the downs yeah I guess oh yeah I can

171
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:05,000
shell okay yeah cool geez I guess I guess I have to make what you do without me so let's let's

172
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:14,000
try to make the uh the jelly roll right well can I do I don't think I even will hold on

173
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:23,000
there any more swords too

174
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:34,000
I'm gonna come back to this in a second I want to go down to

175
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:42,000
I want to look at this one more thing because I want to turn the light on and let him go down

176
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:53,000
go down there can you not go down there whoa well let's head back down

177
00:21:58,000 --> 00:22:06,000
oh boy wow look at this look at this feel like this has something to do with it

178
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:10,000
oh does it yeah it does right I mean it black why wouldn't it

179
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:18,000
oh man I can remember so this is obviously the top row right

180
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:25,000
okay I'm gonna I'm gonna come back to this room but I do want to turn that light on

181
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:33,000
so you go in there now that it's on because there might be something else in here I didn't see

182
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:42,000
can I hear your dog rising up well I can hear it hold on it's very faint

183
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:47,000
just had to point out um you had a real horn dog

184
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:05,000
why did you have to find that out you would only know what it was if you were listening for it

185
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:16,000
yeah okay well obviously that's the same so let's go back in this room can I what does the light

186
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:26,000
have to be on all right please thank you again a loose bike of closure

187
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:36,000
so I should probably write some of these down all right let's make this let's make this circle

188
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:40,000
here what I don't with these symbols even up there

189
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:49,000
can I get a look at these let's see this guy can just tell me anything

190
00:23:49,000 --> 00:23:56,000
okay in turn you shall find two rooms in the round

191
00:23:58,000 --> 00:24:08,000
hmm in turn you shall find two rooms in the round interesting I'm gonna go look and see if those

192
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:15,000
symbols are up there if these symbols are up there then obviously that's the first second

193
00:24:15,000 --> 00:24:18,000
thread bro

194
00:24:19,000 --> 00:24:28,000
Ant Lincoln does this again greetings friend I am Abraham Lincoln I could just take

195
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:35,000
pictures with my phone you're right why does he take so long to do the third one

196
00:24:39,000 --> 00:24:42,000
okay where are those

197
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:47,000
not noticing any really

198
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:59,000
that's like astronauts and

199
00:25:09,000 --> 00:25:11,000
I bet I get maybe there's one picture in here that I can even make

200
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:20,000
can you reset that thing to default I wonder maybe it'll just go to default no

201
00:25:23,000 --> 00:25:26,000
I feel like there's just one picture in here that you can actually make

202
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:39,000
you know I mean like why would this line be here it's it's obviously telling me that

203
00:25:39,000 --> 00:25:45,000
there's something has to be in these three lines right so what can be right moving them each

204
00:25:45,000 --> 00:25:54,000
in the number of clicks that he did possibly but I mean there's got to be one picture I can make here

205
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:06,000
well that's that guy's face downstairs

206
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:15,000
yeah the yellow button is to say hey I did it

207
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:26,000
well it just for fun let's do it was two three one right yeah but that doesn't

208
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:29,000
doesn't that that doesn't determine up or down no

209
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:39,000
it's definitely a picture you have to make in this row but what is the picture

210
00:26:43,000 --> 00:26:46,000
I'll check Instagram check Instagram

211
00:26:51,000 --> 00:26:52,000
scales

212
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:03,000
there's anything else I can click on here no

213
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:20,000
who's that it's got to put the glasses on

214
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:28,000
it has to involve the jelly roll right that's the thing that's been

215
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:32,000
well

216
00:27:35,000 --> 00:27:39,000
hold on I want to go back to the first room because remember I don't think I pushed

217
00:27:39,000 --> 00:27:46,000
I didn't push that thing all the way forward can I keep pushing this I think I can right yeah

218
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:50,000
should be able to no I guess not

219
00:27:56,000 --> 00:27:59,000
not I guess not

220
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:09,000
what about this this is the only row that like is full

221
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:19,000
in turn you shall find two rooms in the round

222
00:28:23,000 --> 00:28:24,000
now that just opens the door

223
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:30,000
yeah I'm gonna send the dog back in

224
00:28:31,000 --> 00:28:36,000
well go and go in I think he actually used to be in the room

225
00:28:43,000 --> 00:28:47,000
symbols of this show have to mean something

226
00:28:47,000 --> 00:28:56,000
me

227
00:28:59,000 --> 00:28:59,000
me

228
00:29:03,000 --> 00:29:08,000
all right look that okay all right all right all right all right all right that jelly roll is

229
00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:12,000
in that spot look at one two three jelly rolled absolutely goes in the left spot

230
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:20,000
but apps are positive a little why would they have these three squares so if that's the first one

231
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:24,000
what determines the second and third slot

232
00:29:27,000 --> 00:29:32,000
is it the two things the two things I broke down but were those even pictures I don't remember

233
00:29:33,000 --> 00:29:36,000
let's go find out

234
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:41,000
but yeah the jelly roll app is in the first spot

235
00:29:49,000 --> 00:29:56,000
let's just let's go back to that room when do you get it gone

236
00:29:57,000 --> 00:30:05,000
hmm I want to look at the symbols again that were on this thing

237
00:30:09,000 --> 00:30:16,000
I love it this is a heart it's like beating okay let's get the jelly roll here

238
00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:27,000
there is all right this has to be in this spot I can't put this anywhere else it has to be here

239
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:30,000
now where is

240
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:38,000
anything else all right

241
00:30:38,000 --> 00:30:50,000
is there a spike that kind of looks like it right not really though

242
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:56,000
oh

243
00:30:58,000 --> 00:31:09,000
well can I maybe I can see oh geez Louise you can fucking go higher whatever happened here

244
00:31:09,000 --> 00:31:18,000
it was not good all right well we figured it out we could go up a rub look at this guy

245
00:31:19,000 --> 00:31:24,000
can you go any higher yes there's even more all right there's a whole lot going on here let's

246
00:31:25,000 --> 00:31:30,000
holy shit that's gross can I talk to this guy yeah you're gonna want to write that down

247
00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:35,000
term and there were a lot of people saying they salted it already even without knowing you could

248
00:31:35,000 --> 00:31:45,000
go up this isn't really doing anything sure you this is going to walk over here

249
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:51,000
okay another piece to pick up I should probably take this

250
00:31:55,000 --> 00:31:56,000
can't put anything in here

251
00:31:56,000 --> 00:32:10,000
I guess I can't walk over here yet can the dog go over there no I like did get another lever

252
00:32:15,000 --> 00:32:21,000
this looks very important look at that mess I'm gonna have to figure that out eventually

253
00:32:21,000 --> 00:32:26,000
this remind I believe is the important room

254
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:36,000
anything I can do in here well this is where the lever goes

255
00:32:43,000 --> 00:32:43,000
okay

256
00:32:43,000 --> 00:32:55,000
there's two rooms in the ground I guess I had to just keep going what about that can you do

257
00:32:55,000 --> 00:33:06,000
anything with that dog yes you can nice work peak peak this is a cool room

258
00:33:06,000 --> 00:33:12,000
oh

259
00:33:12,000 --> 00:33:16,000
hopefully oh I've seen these symbols too

260
00:33:19,000 --> 00:33:26,000
yep this square was on top of the octopus I don't I gotta turn the machine on though

261
00:33:28,000 --> 00:33:29,000
right I think I do

262
00:33:29,000 --> 00:33:31,000
I

263
00:33:34,000 --> 00:33:35,000
turns on a vacuum he has to go up there

264
00:33:42,000 --> 00:33:44,000
do I have enough time to get there

265
00:33:46,000 --> 00:33:51,000
I'm not sure right that down maybe I should write that part down

266
00:33:51,000 --> 00:34:02,000
so one thing I have noticed is yes these correspond to certain rooms right that down

267
00:34:03,000 --> 00:34:06,000
I don't need to write down yet I must get a remember

268
00:34:07,000 --> 00:34:11,000
can the dog come in the dog can't come in here no right that dog

269
00:34:11,000 --> 00:34:17,000
can I make it before this now I can't

270
00:34:19,000 --> 00:34:20,000
anything else in here that I need to

271
00:34:24,000 --> 00:34:25,000
is there a crystal floating up there

272
00:34:27,000 --> 00:34:30,000
but we talked about the notebook this is why you have the notebook

273
00:34:32,000 --> 00:34:34,000
now I'm gonna go back to the other room let's figure out the first thing first

274
00:34:34,000 --> 00:34:37,000
because these things might not all be in the same order

275
00:34:38,000 --> 00:34:41,000
is there still another room to go into

276
00:34:45,000 --> 00:34:48,000
so see here I want to I want to just remember this because look up here

277
00:34:50,000 --> 00:34:53,000
that rectangle right here

278
00:34:55,000 --> 00:34:59,000
corresponds to the octopus these three prongs

279
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:11,000
was this game handmade yes it was this whole game is made out of clay and stuff and blocks and

280
00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:14,000
word and all kinds of cool things

281
00:35:18,000 --> 00:35:19,000
there's a button press the button

282
00:35:24,000 --> 00:35:25,000
move the dog has to press it

283
00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:31,000
can why don't you press the button please

284
00:35:39,000 --> 00:35:43,000
touch it it's got a lightning bolt on it I need to write that down

285
00:35:52,000 --> 00:35:54,000
lightning bolt over button

286
00:35:55,000 --> 00:36:02,000
there a lightning bolt was also over the car the top right oh it was

287
00:36:04,000 --> 00:36:07,000
I don't need more that's down maybe that's how you power the that's probably how you power the car

288
00:36:09,000 --> 00:36:10,000
so I guess you go

289
00:36:13,000 --> 00:36:19,000
you know I'm gonna put the dog in here obviously another trippy freaky ass room

290
00:36:24,000 --> 00:36:28,000
feel like we're getting closer to solving the first Abraham Lincoln puzzle

291
00:36:30,000 --> 00:36:36,000
oh there it is there's the second symbol there's the second symbol

292
00:36:39,000 --> 00:36:42,000
I'd call that I'd call that

293
00:36:45,000 --> 00:36:46,000
Pac-Man's cousin eating a lightning bolt

294
00:36:54,000 --> 00:37:01,000
now theoretically the here's like the theoretical right we could go do that and then just

295
00:37:01,000 --> 00:37:04,000
wild guess on the third one and get it eventually uh germa

296
00:37:06,000 --> 00:37:10,000
that is actually baby carriage can struck by lightning I don't want to make sure you got that

297
00:37:10,000 --> 00:37:22,000
that symbol right no it's Pac-Man's super cool sideburn brother

298
00:37:22,000 --> 00:37:29,000
eating a lightning power up in the new Pac-Man's cousin game it's a different power up

299
00:37:29,000 --> 00:37:40,000
oh okay I still haven't played that one yeah remember that though okay let's go back

300
00:37:44,000 --> 00:37:52,000
this is armacrog it's currently oh I just clicked out of the window whoops

301
00:37:52,000 --> 00:38:02,000
let's see if we can actually finish that puzzle

302
00:38:04,000 --> 00:38:07,000
go back down

303
00:38:12,000 --> 00:38:15,000
Pac-Man Elvis impersonator that there there you go there it is

304
00:38:15,000 --> 00:38:20,000
okay where is it

305
00:38:26,000 --> 00:38:28,000
hmm this is not lined up correctly is it

306
00:38:32,000 --> 00:38:35,000
there's that one can I get the jelly back here though

307
00:38:39,000 --> 00:38:41,000
where's the jelly I gotta get it in the right spot

308
00:38:46,000 --> 00:38:52,000
oh this is tough this is like a puzzle within a puzzle

309
00:38:54,000 --> 00:39:01,000
no is there only one it must have to be like perfectly lined up

310
00:39:06,000 --> 00:39:07,000
what the hell is the jelly

311
00:39:16,000 --> 00:39:24,000
there it is oh oh okay I get it okay let's see if that's the one

312
00:39:34,000 --> 00:39:36,000
yeah but I don't know what the last symbol is there's no way to tell

313
00:39:38,000 --> 00:39:44,000
you just have to spam it see which the last one I gotta get it video no I didn't

314
00:39:45,000 --> 00:39:50,000
always it just no it's just different every time I thought I had it all right well there's

315
00:39:50,000 --> 00:39:57,000
no way to determine that because I might have to move these around too like this so we need to find

316
00:39:57,000 --> 00:40:04,000
that last symbol it's only like 50 other possibilities

317
00:40:04,000 --> 00:40:18,000
one thing that's been a common factor here is the dog is the one that sees them so

318
00:40:20,000 --> 00:40:25,000
did I miss an area where he can go I don't think I did

319
00:40:25,000 --> 00:40:29,000
go back in here

320
00:40:35,000 --> 00:40:36,000
I touch anything in this room

321
00:40:43,000 --> 00:40:43,000
don't think so

322
00:40:49,000 --> 00:40:51,000
I feel like I should be able to press this button

323
00:40:56,000 --> 00:40:57,000
for some reason I can't I don't know

324
00:40:57,000 --> 00:40:59,000
I know

325
00:41:18,000 --> 00:41:24,000
bohoo ok that is symbol is in this room

326
00:41:24,000 --> 00:41:29,000
Star pay attention that symbols in this room. Oh, thanks little buddy. Oh

327
00:41:33,000 --> 00:41:37,000
That lowered it I still can't operate this though

328
00:41:42,000 --> 00:41:44,000
Okay, right that down

329
00:41:45,000 --> 00:41:48,000
Yeah, the right it down

330
00:41:54,000 --> 00:41:56,000
down

331
00:42:04,000 --> 00:42:11,000
So for that to activate that has to be there so I can't do that puzzle until that room is in the right spot

332
00:42:19,000 --> 00:42:21,000
That's different

333
00:42:25,000 --> 00:42:27,000
Oh, wait, what the fuck is this thing?

334
00:42:29,000 --> 00:42:31,000
I'm like scared to go in this room. I feel like he's gonna eat me

335
00:42:37,000 --> 00:42:39,000
Oh boy

336
00:42:44,000 --> 00:42:46,000
What was that

337
00:42:47,000 --> 00:42:55,000
It's a it's baby

338
00:42:59,000 --> 00:43:04,000
Can you imagine the wandering monsters this thing is attracting I'm just saying

339
00:43:07,000 --> 00:43:11,000
Tommy Tommy don't touch that thing you don't know where it's fun

340
00:43:16,000 --> 00:43:18,000
Oh

341
00:43:21,000 --> 00:43:23,000
P

342
00:43:23,000 --> 00:43:25,000
Okay

343
00:43:27,000 --> 00:43:36,000
There you go Tommy not has you now I'll take care of you and I'll just strike that baby with lighting figure out how to get you back to where you belong

344
00:43:41,000 --> 00:43:46,000
So I hold I have there's put the baby in my wife when I just put that baby

345
00:43:47,000 --> 00:43:49,000
I'm gonna deliver

346
00:43:53,000 --> 00:43:55,000
A little weird look at this thing

347
00:44:07,000 --> 00:44:10,000
Something else has to be in this room. This is a weird pattern for the cracks

348
00:44:16,000 --> 00:44:18,000
Was that a symbol I don't remember

349
00:44:22,000 --> 00:44:25,000
Well, just remember that's a good square with the

350
00:44:27,000 --> 00:44:29,000
I got what what can I do with that lever

351
00:44:31,000 --> 00:44:33,000
Can't grab any of this stuff can I

352
00:44:37,000 --> 00:44:39,000
Cracks weird pattern right that down

353
00:44:40,000 --> 00:44:50,000
Yeah, that lever has to go somewhere so let's find out where I was gonna remember that weird crack symbol looking thing

354
00:44:53,000 --> 00:45:01,000
Please cry wait what I'm like pulling up oh boy

355
00:45:10,000 --> 00:45:15,000
Um, so I can't leave oh

356
00:45:18,000 --> 00:45:20,000
Shit

357
00:45:27,000 --> 00:45:29,000
Did I get it

358
00:45:40,000 --> 00:45:42,000
Oh

359
00:45:44,000 --> 00:45:46,000
It's a song

360
00:45:46,000 --> 00:45:48,000
Oh

361
00:46:08,000 --> 00:46:10,000
It's not right

362
00:46:17,000 --> 00:46:19,000
That goes there right

363
00:46:23,000 --> 00:46:26,000
Okay, that's in the right spot. So yeah, these two just need to be flipped

364
00:46:29,000 --> 00:46:31,000
This is the one

365
00:46:32,000 --> 00:46:35,000
Write that down write that song down didn't even need to write it down

366
00:46:38,000 --> 00:46:40,000
I get blow it

367
00:46:40,000 --> 00:46:42,000
Oh

368
00:46:46,000 --> 00:46:48,000
I can take the other ones off oh

369
00:46:49,000 --> 00:46:51,000
I hope that doesn't mean I have to take off the punch of these

370
00:47:05,000 --> 00:47:07,000
So the back ones are the ones that are correct

371
00:47:10,000 --> 00:47:12,000
Oh

372
00:47:24,000 --> 00:47:26,000
Yeah

373
00:47:31,000 --> 00:47:33,000
Just wrap them all off

374
00:47:34,000 --> 00:47:38,000
All right, so it goes

375
00:47:40,000 --> 00:47:42,000
No, no, I've worked I got it

376
00:47:44,000 --> 00:47:46,000
You threw up a well that was interesting

377
00:47:49,000 --> 00:47:51,000
So there's one of these crystals pick it up please

378
00:47:53,000 --> 00:47:56,000
There was another crystal in the other one back here, but I got a lever right

379
00:47:56,000 --> 00:48:04,000
Let's find where that lever needs to go I think it's up here

380
00:48:10,000 --> 00:48:12,000
No

381
00:48:14,000 --> 00:48:16,000
Go back up there to me

382
00:48:16,000 --> 00:48:18,000
I

383
00:48:26,000 --> 00:48:28,000
Can probably now use this to repress the button

384
00:48:29,000 --> 00:48:32,000
Thank good thing star was there to contribute and tell me what I needed to do

385
00:48:36,000 --> 00:48:38,000
Pull it

386
00:48:47,000 --> 00:48:49,000
Huh the hell's he doing?

387
00:48:50,000 --> 00:48:52,000
Is he all right, who's this freaking out?

388
00:48:53,000 --> 00:48:57,000
So I have to power it on but I couldn't press that button before

389
00:48:58,000 --> 00:49:01,000
Maybe was can he just go no

390
00:49:03,000 --> 00:49:07,000
There's no power here the power needs to be turned on in this room

391
00:49:09,000 --> 00:49:11,000
I am going to piss my pants by the way I

392
00:49:13,000 --> 00:49:16,000
Can't I got it I got to get this first like area done

393
00:49:16,000 --> 00:49:18,000
Before I piss my pants

394
00:49:19,000 --> 00:49:21,000
It's really important

395
00:49:21,000 --> 00:49:24,000
Now we're gonna turn the room back to where it was

396
00:49:28,000 --> 00:49:30,000
Now what is what is

397
00:49:32,000 --> 00:49:35,000
This means that there's power when I turn it to the right spot

398
00:49:41,000 --> 00:49:45,000
You know what I mean I mean I know I have to like oh turn the power on but that light turned on

399
00:49:47,000 --> 00:49:56,000
Because there's some connection that has to be made to this button

400
00:50:05,000 --> 00:50:11,000
I'm I'm just gonna say that I'm gonna try that I'm gonna make I'm gonna turn this so the light turns on because then there's

401
00:50:11,000 --> 00:50:13,000
Maybe germ hour

402
00:50:14,000 --> 00:50:22,000
And regards to the power if I assume you do with the green Nickelodeon sludge in the pipes in the room below that is the room you can't get into

403
00:50:23,000 --> 00:50:29,000
Maybe I want to try this first. That's my vibe I'm getting I just want to see because that like the light is on now

404
00:50:29,000 --> 00:50:31,000
I wonder if that does anything

405
00:50:34,000 --> 00:50:36,000
Okay, germa

406
00:50:36,000 --> 00:50:38,000
If you say boss

407
00:50:39,000 --> 00:50:41,000
Okay

408
00:50:41,000 --> 00:50:47,000
The dial upstairs can be used

409
00:50:57,000 --> 00:50:59,000
This turning this

410
00:51:12,000 --> 00:51:20,000
All right, so that turns remember where that is so see what happens when I spin stuff

411
00:51:23,000 --> 00:51:25,000
Wow spin the wind

412
00:51:26,000 --> 00:51:28,000
Because this there are things all over this

413
00:51:35,000 --> 00:51:37,000
All right, yeah, so that's changing

414
00:51:41,000 --> 00:51:47,000
Do it again this is a speedrun

415
00:51:53,000 --> 00:51:55,000
Well, that was kind of that was buggy

416
00:52:01,000 --> 00:52:03,000
One more time maybe

417
00:52:03,000 --> 00:52:05,000
I

418
00:52:08,000 --> 00:52:15,000
Got a quiz have you been writing these things down star I've written everything down that has happened I am the cartographer good

419
00:52:20,000 --> 00:52:22,000
What's the quiz

420
00:52:23,000 --> 00:52:26,000
The quizzes just did that there was no quiz

421
00:52:30,000 --> 00:52:32,000
It's gonna be on a test

422
00:52:34,000 --> 00:52:39,000
You know it might just be can I just not press the button? I feel like it's not I feel like it's gonna be lined up when that room is

423
00:52:40,000 --> 00:52:42,000
Connected I

424
00:52:42,000 --> 00:52:47,000
Really do I feel like when that room is connected to the one with the button and it'll be lined up, but I can't press the button

425
00:52:48,000 --> 00:52:50,000
Hope that's not a bug. I

426
00:52:51,000 --> 00:52:53,000
Hope that isn't a bug

427
00:52:54,000 --> 00:52:56,000
You can hear what I said you moron

428
00:52:57,000 --> 00:52:59,000
Too busy paying attention to the video game

429
00:53:01,000 --> 00:53:03,000
Go look in the power room again

430
00:53:03,000 --> 00:53:05,000
You're gonna agree with you once you see it

431
00:53:05,000 --> 00:53:09,000
You talk about the green slime. Yeah, and they glow to in goo. Yeah

432
00:53:10,000 --> 00:53:13,000
You need to amp up that goo way before you can power

433
00:53:14,000 --> 00:53:17,000
There's no way to work. I want to just get this in the right spot. I

434
00:53:21,000 --> 00:53:23,000
Never gonna do it dude

435
00:53:25,000 --> 00:53:27,000
Shit

436
00:53:27,000 --> 00:53:29,000
Can those even line up I feel like it

437
00:53:33,000 --> 00:53:38,000
All right, let's see. It's probably gonna be lined up

438
00:53:39,000 --> 00:53:41,000
With thank right

439
00:53:42,000 --> 00:53:44,000
No, it isn't

440
00:53:48,000 --> 00:53:50,000
I don't even feel like

441
00:53:50,000 --> 00:53:55,000
Be worried about this right now. No, but I just wanted to make sure I wanted to get it in the right spot that power

442
00:53:56,000 --> 00:53:58,000
So you're saying in this room you're talking about in here, right?

443
00:53:58,000 --> 00:54:00,000
like this

444
00:54:00,000 --> 00:54:06,000
Green go shit. Yeah, it's a very low and the room below that the where you didn't imagine the green

445
00:54:06,000 --> 00:54:10,000
Group is coming from you can't get into yet. So I'd leave this until you figure that out. Yeah

446
00:54:12,000 --> 00:54:14,000
I just wish I could press the button. I

447
00:54:15,000 --> 00:54:17,000
Just love pressing buttons. I know I do

448
00:54:25,000 --> 00:54:27,000
Every time I press button I write it down

449
00:54:30,000 --> 00:54:32,000
Yeah, the squiggles are aligned now

450
00:54:33,000 --> 00:54:35,000
Right no

451
00:54:38,000 --> 00:54:42,000
Dude, I'm gonna buy the game and raise you raise me

452
00:54:47,000 --> 00:54:49,000
Those other one I didn't do on I want to do this

453
00:54:56,000 --> 00:54:59,000
It's a lot of trial and error to see if this works

454
00:55:01,000 --> 00:55:07,000
I did skip one although you're getting the error heart down right

455
00:55:10,000 --> 00:55:12,000
What is on it? Let's go look under there

456
00:55:16,000 --> 00:55:18,000
Yeah, cuz I can't get in this room

457
00:55:20,000 --> 00:55:23,000
Man, I wish I could just like accidentally get this

458
00:55:26,000 --> 00:55:28,000
And let's wait a second wait a second wait a second wait just a second

459
00:55:30,000 --> 00:55:37,000
Like maybe this is like a go symbol, right? Maybe it's like a green go symbol

460
00:55:38,000 --> 00:55:42,000
The third and most important symbol has been that lightning bolt. Is there a lightning bolt symbol?

461
00:55:43,000 --> 00:55:47,000
Let's find out that's true. The lightning bolt is on the baby carriage, so maybe not

462
00:55:57,000 --> 00:55:59,000
Is there a baby maybe that's a baby?

463
00:56:00,000 --> 00:56:02,000
oh

464
00:56:18,000 --> 00:56:20,000
As this calls these collete's a baby

465
00:56:20,000 --> 00:56:21,000
No.

466
00:56:21,000 --> 00:56:33,000
All right, well, I think we could sit here and wild guess as much as we want.

467
00:56:33,000 --> 00:56:36,000
But that's not going to work.

468
00:56:36,000 --> 00:56:41,000
So I can't get in this room, have to get in this room to figure out the power, so maybe

469
00:56:41,000 --> 00:56:43,000
we go down.

470
00:56:43,000 --> 00:56:44,000
Can I touch this?

471
00:56:44,000 --> 00:56:45,000
Can I do anything here?

472
00:56:45,000 --> 00:56:46,000
Greetings, friend.

473
00:56:46,000 --> 00:56:49,000
I am Abraham Hantling.

474
00:56:49,000 --> 00:57:06,000
Let's take a look at the...

475
00:57:06,000 --> 00:57:16,000
Nothing in the middle row, at least speaks to me.

476
00:57:16,000 --> 00:57:18,000
Try it, though.

477
00:57:18,000 --> 00:57:23,000
Got it.

478
00:57:23,000 --> 00:57:25,000
Got it.

479
00:57:25,000 --> 00:57:30,000
Oh boy, this is not good.

480
00:57:30,000 --> 00:57:35,000
What does that do?

481
00:57:35,000 --> 00:57:37,000
Oh Jesus.

482
00:57:37,000 --> 00:57:41,000
Are you serious?

483
00:57:41,000 --> 00:57:44,000
I got to like freeze the room.

484
00:57:44,000 --> 00:57:51,000
I got to line this up.

485
00:57:51,000 --> 00:57:54,000
Uh.

486
00:57:54,000 --> 00:58:02,000
Let's go all the way to the left.

487
00:58:02,000 --> 00:58:09,000
You can only go a certain amount of ways, right?

488
00:58:09,000 --> 00:58:16,000
What does that mean?

489
00:58:16,000 --> 00:58:19,000
Slow down.

490
00:58:19,000 --> 00:58:23,000
Slow down.

491
00:58:23,000 --> 00:58:27,000
Slow down.

492
00:58:27,000 --> 00:58:45,000
Oh, okay, so one, two, two.

493
00:58:45,000 --> 00:58:47,000
I guess I have to make it hit it twice.

494
00:58:47,000 --> 00:58:51,000
There needs to be two in the middle.

495
00:58:51,000 --> 00:58:55,000
Yeah, I think that's what you have to do.

496
00:58:55,000 --> 00:58:57,000
Oh shit, no, it's doing, okay, see what it's doing?

497
00:58:57,000 --> 00:59:01,000
It's doing each part of you.

498
00:59:01,000 --> 00:59:03,000
Oh, yeah, man, dude, come on, man.

499
00:59:03,000 --> 00:59:08,000
I really do think of it as part of the scene.

500
00:59:08,000 --> 00:59:14,000
So it's gotta go over here.

501
00:59:14,000 --> 00:59:15,000
It's like a, it's a safe.

502
00:59:15,000 --> 00:59:16,000
It's a lock.

503
00:59:16,000 --> 00:59:19,000
So let's try this.

504
00:59:19,000 --> 00:59:24,000
Let's get this one here.

505
00:59:24,000 --> 00:59:25,000
So that one is not frozen.

506
00:59:25,000 --> 00:59:26,000
Let's see.

507
00:59:26,000 --> 00:59:31,000
That one will start to move.

508
00:59:31,000 --> 00:59:42,000
I'm assuming this is the answer, right?

509
00:59:42,000 --> 00:59:44,000
Let's try and do that again.

510
00:59:44,000 --> 00:59:54,000
Let me go to the right.

511
00:59:54,000 --> 01:00:02,000
I'm going to assume this is correct.

512
01:00:02,000 --> 01:00:03,000
There it is.

513
01:00:03,000 --> 01:00:09,000
All right, so this is the line, power, check, and I should be able to press the button now.

514
01:00:09,000 --> 01:00:11,000
Should I pull this?

515
01:00:11,000 --> 01:00:12,000
No.

516
01:00:12,000 --> 01:00:14,000
I'm scared to pull that.

517
01:00:14,000 --> 01:00:18,000
I don't want to let you reset it.

518
01:00:18,000 --> 01:00:25,000
So let's go back up.

519
01:00:25,000 --> 01:00:28,000
Now go back in this room.

520
01:00:28,000 --> 01:00:37,000
I wonder if we have a thing I can do if I can press the button.

521
01:00:37,000 --> 01:00:47,000
One more.

522
01:00:47,000 --> 01:00:47,000
We all doubted him.

523
01:00:47,000 --> 01:00:48,000
He's a genius.

524
01:00:48,000 --> 01:00:54,000
Nothing, not really.

525
01:00:54,000 --> 01:00:58,000
Ah.

526
01:00:58,000 --> 01:01:08,000
Well, shit.

527
01:01:08,000 --> 01:01:21,000
The camera didn't solve it the way that I wanted.

528
01:01:21,000 --> 01:01:25,000
This is connected now.

529
01:01:25,000 --> 01:01:28,000
So now, okay, now, this should be power to it.

530
01:01:28,000 --> 01:01:32,000
If I get to the power side.

531
01:01:32,000 --> 01:01:36,000
All right.

532
01:01:36,000 --> 01:01:42,000
I'm going to go up there first just to make sure.

533
01:01:42,000 --> 01:01:47,000
I don't want to spin the, I can't press that button.

534
01:01:47,000 --> 01:01:50,000
I love this song, by the way.

535
01:01:50,000 --> 01:02:06,000
I want to listen to it for a second.

536
01:02:06,000 --> 01:02:13,000
Look at this complete.

537
01:02:13,000 --> 01:02:17,000
Shit.

538
01:02:17,000 --> 01:02:25,000
There's one of the tubes.

539
01:02:25,000 --> 01:02:35,000
Now, the real question is, is this going to be lined up?

540
01:02:35,000 --> 01:02:41,000
If the power turns on here.

541
01:02:41,000 --> 01:02:44,000
So now, okay, we got power.

542
01:02:44,000 --> 01:02:50,000
I wonder if this is going to be out of alignment now.

543
01:02:50,000 --> 01:02:52,000
Not still in alignment.

544
01:02:52,000 --> 01:02:57,000
But I don't think there's any power.

545
01:02:57,000 --> 01:03:00,000
No, there's not.

546
01:03:00,000 --> 01:03:01,000
Gotta hit that button.

547
01:03:01,000 --> 01:03:08,000
I have to activate that button.

548
01:03:08,000 --> 01:03:17,000
I got to suck up the dog in that vacuum.

549
01:03:17,000 --> 01:03:24,000
I'm going to go back down here.

550
01:03:24,000 --> 01:03:31,000
I'm going to look in here one more time.

551
01:03:31,000 --> 01:03:38,000
No, I don't want to change that.

552
01:03:38,000 --> 01:03:55,000
What does he have to say anything?

553
01:03:55,000 --> 01:03:56,000
Nothing.

554
01:03:56,000 --> 01:03:59,000
All is in your hands now.

555
01:03:59,000 --> 01:04:01,000
The threshold has been crossed.

556
01:04:01,000 --> 01:04:02,000
Who is this by the way?

557
01:04:02,000 --> 01:04:06,000
Is that like Noah?

558
01:04:06,000 --> 01:04:13,000
I don't think there's anything I'm doing here.

559
01:04:13,000 --> 01:04:24,000
I'm going to go to the vacuum room.

560
01:04:24,000 --> 01:04:28,000
I'm definitely going to pee though.

561
01:04:28,000 --> 01:04:31,000
I'll let you guys enjoy this while I go pee.

562
01:04:31,000 --> 01:04:33,000
I'll be back in like two minutes.

563
01:04:33,000 --> 01:04:35,000
Quick bathroom break.

564
01:04:35,000 --> 01:04:40,000
I'm going to go over this in my head.

565
01:04:40,000 --> 01:04:42,000
Somebody's just making like what's your fart noises?

566
01:04:42,000 --> 01:04:44,000
All right, I'll be right back.

567
01:04:44,000 --> 01:04:45,000
I'm going to just pee.

568
01:04:45,000 --> 01:04:50,000
Here's my professional hold on screen.

569
01:04:50,000 --> 01:04:57,000
I'll be right back.

570
01:04:57,000 --> 01:04:58,000
Start.

571
01:04:58,000 --> 01:05:00,000
Tell them a funny story.

572
01:05:00,000 --> 01:05:03,000
I want to be your funny story.

573
01:05:03,000 --> 01:05:07,000
Once upon a time,

574
01:05:07,000 --> 01:05:12,000
Jerma played our frog.

575
01:05:12,000 --> 01:05:20,000
He was um...

576
01:05:20,000 --> 01:05:30,000
One spawn time.

577
01:05:30,000 --> 01:05:35,000
I was never been writing down any jokes.

578
01:05:35,000 --> 01:05:38,000
I really haven't been paying that much attention.

579
01:05:38,000 --> 01:05:41,000
It's really hard to follow what's been going on on screen

580
01:05:41,000 --> 01:05:49,000
because he's saying everything like 15 seconds ahead of me seeing it.

581
01:05:49,000 --> 01:06:10,000
That's typical streamer boy stuff.

582
01:06:10,000 --> 01:06:12,000
Yeah, the stream was really dead without you.

583
01:06:12,000 --> 01:06:14,000
Where are you dude?

584
01:06:14,000 --> 01:06:17,000
I thought I heard a door.

585
01:06:17,000 --> 01:06:24,000
Maybe that was a door in real life.

586
01:06:24,000 --> 01:06:38,000
Yeah.

587
01:06:38,000 --> 01:06:53,000
Just sitting here at the Elmo screen.

588
01:06:53,000 --> 01:07:20,000
Here you come out.

589
01:07:20,000 --> 01:07:23,000
I hope the story was good.

590
01:07:23,000 --> 01:07:26,000
I think people are still laughing about it.

591
01:07:26,000 --> 01:07:31,000
It was awesome.

592
01:07:31,000 --> 01:07:34,000
It was awesome.

593
01:07:34,000 --> 01:07:37,000
Okay, let's go over a couple things in my brain here.

594
01:07:37,000 --> 01:07:39,000
I have a crystal.

595
01:07:39,000 --> 01:07:46,000
I have the power turned on.

596
01:07:46,000 --> 01:07:49,000
What was the power run?

597
01:07:49,000 --> 01:07:52,000
I actually had the power in it.

598
01:07:52,000 --> 01:07:55,000
Now the stream is boring again.

599
01:07:55,000 --> 01:07:59,000
That turned us back.

600
01:07:59,000 --> 01:08:02,000
You know what you can do.

601
01:08:02,000 --> 01:08:09,000
You can suck an egg.

602
01:08:09,000 --> 01:08:12,000
What a weird insult that is.

603
01:08:12,000 --> 01:08:15,000
Thanks little buddy.

604
01:08:15,000 --> 01:08:25,000
That's pretty weird.

605
01:08:25,000 --> 01:08:30,000
Can this be activated now?

606
01:08:30,000 --> 01:08:34,000
Maybe if I put something up here.

607
01:08:34,000 --> 01:08:36,000
I feel like the dog has to be in here with me.

608
01:08:36,000 --> 01:08:37,000
Can I weigh that down?

609
01:08:37,000 --> 01:08:40,000
Maybe I can put the baby on the green thing?

610
01:08:40,000 --> 01:08:46,000
Maybe too.

611
01:08:46,000 --> 01:08:50,000
Obviously the dog has to go up there.

612
01:08:50,000 --> 01:08:52,000
But how do I get...

613
01:08:52,000 --> 01:08:56,000
I might have to actually put the baby on that.

614
01:08:56,000 --> 01:09:02,000
Kill the baby.

615
01:09:02,000 --> 01:09:09,000
Because this doesn't really seem to do anything yet, at least.

616
01:09:09,000 --> 01:09:15,000
You know that baby vomited it?

617
01:09:15,000 --> 01:09:18,000
I get threw up and gave it that green crystal.

618
01:09:18,000 --> 01:09:23,000
And then you suck it to vomit back in your stomach with it.

619
01:09:23,000 --> 01:09:27,000
So?

620
01:09:27,000 --> 01:09:34,000
I can't go on here.

621
01:09:35,000 --> 01:09:40,000
Can't interact with that.

622
01:09:40,000 --> 01:09:45,000
Alright, let's go over a couple of things.

623
01:09:45,000 --> 01:09:48,000
I have a crystal.

624
01:09:48,000 --> 01:10:03,000
I need to turn the power on so I can use the roller coaster.

625
01:10:03,000 --> 01:10:06,000
And then there's the vacuum there that he sucked the dog up.

626
01:10:06,000 --> 01:10:16,000
And the dog ends up up here.

627
01:10:16,000 --> 01:10:18,000
I'm assuming, right?

628
01:10:18,000 --> 01:10:26,000
He comes out of one of these tubes.

629
01:10:27,000 --> 01:10:33,000
Whatever.

630
01:10:33,000 --> 01:10:41,000
I can't really keep him there either.

631
01:10:41,000 --> 01:10:50,000
I'm gonna go back in the room.

632
01:10:50,000 --> 01:10:57,000
There's nothing else in there besides the dog.

633
01:10:57,000 --> 01:11:14,000
That's just free.

634
01:11:15,000 --> 01:11:21,000
He's going up.

635
01:11:21,000 --> 01:11:31,000
He goes in here and he comes up the other side.

636
01:11:31,000 --> 01:11:36,000
Let's want to look at this again.

637
01:11:36,000 --> 01:11:40,000
Can he go anywhere?

638
01:11:40,000 --> 01:11:47,000
I don't think he can go anywhere else.

639
01:11:47,000 --> 01:11:53,000
Alright.

640
01:11:53,000 --> 01:12:00,000
He can't do this either.

641
01:12:00,000 --> 01:12:15,000
And click every single inch of this.

642
01:12:15,000 --> 01:12:20,000
Because that is right in his wheelhouse.

643
01:12:20,000 --> 01:12:24,000
He's ready to press this button.

644
01:12:24,000 --> 01:12:31,000
Look at how ready he is just to put his face in the button.

645
01:12:31,000 --> 01:12:43,000
At least you should be able to press it, right?

646
01:12:43,000 --> 01:12:50,000
Even if it doesn't do anything.

647
01:12:50,000 --> 01:12:54,000
Maybe it's just an indicator.

648
01:12:54,000 --> 01:13:08,000
Otto, what are you doing?

649
01:13:08,000 --> 01:13:10,000
I'm going to go down.

650
01:13:10,000 --> 01:13:16,000
I'm going to look at the orange thing.

651
01:13:16,000 --> 01:13:26,000
This can't be interacted with.

652
01:13:26,000 --> 01:13:33,000
These don't mean anything yet.

653
01:13:33,000 --> 01:13:35,000
Oh, hold on.

654
01:13:35,000 --> 01:13:40,000
Hold on a second.

655
01:13:40,000 --> 01:13:42,000
Wait a second.

656
01:13:42,000 --> 01:13:45,000
That's the same type of button that's up there.

657
01:13:45,000 --> 01:13:51,000
Where if we just turning the power off down here means the power on upstairs can be turned on.

658
01:13:51,000 --> 01:13:55,000
That would be crazy if that's what this was.

659
01:13:55,000 --> 01:14:00,000
That is a very never-hoot thing if that's what the problem is.

660
01:14:00,000 --> 01:14:02,000
Like, oh, you can't.

661
01:14:02,000 --> 01:14:09,000
You've got to use the power upstairs.

662
01:14:09,000 --> 01:14:12,000
I guess not.

663
01:14:12,000 --> 01:14:24,000
Should have wrote that down.

664
01:14:24,000 --> 01:14:27,000
Does the octopus talk?

665
01:14:27,000 --> 01:14:33,000
No, he doesn't.

666
01:14:33,000 --> 01:14:40,000
I wonder if you can make him like stay.

667
01:14:40,000 --> 01:14:48,000
Trying to think about what hasn't been done.

668
01:14:48,000 --> 01:15:15,000
The only thing I can think of is trying to get into the crystal room, but that power is not like on.

669
01:15:15,000 --> 01:15:18,000
Maybe the power has to be on here.

670
01:15:18,000 --> 01:15:21,000
Then I can put the dog on here and then go in and do that.

671
01:15:21,000 --> 01:15:26,000
Try that. Maybe this works.

672
01:15:26,000 --> 01:15:28,000
See what that does.

673
01:15:28,000 --> 01:15:31,000
Nice work, beak, beak.

674
01:15:31,000 --> 01:15:32,000
You know what I mean?

675
01:15:32,000 --> 01:15:35,000
Now is this turned on?

676
01:15:35,000 --> 01:15:56,000
No, the dog come with me.

677
01:16:26,000 --> 01:16:33,000
Fucking stopped.

678
01:16:33,000 --> 01:16:40,000
I'm stopped.

679
01:16:40,000 --> 01:16:55,000
Let's take the dog back through here.

680
01:16:55,000 --> 01:17:00,000
Try to have the dog talk to the octopus and the weird.

681
01:17:00,000 --> 01:17:02,000
That's a good idea.

682
01:17:02,000 --> 01:17:03,000
That's a very good idea.

683
01:17:03,000 --> 01:17:08,000
I'm going to do that.

684
01:17:08,000 --> 01:17:10,000
Maybe he'll tell me something like,

685
01:17:10,000 --> 01:17:13,000
you need to turn the power on, press the button.

686
01:17:13,000 --> 01:17:18,000
That's not the right room.

687
01:17:18,000 --> 01:17:19,000
I hope that works.

688
01:17:19,000 --> 01:17:24,000
Otherwise, I'm not entirely sure what else to do.

689
01:17:24,000 --> 01:17:28,000
Any thoughts?

690
01:17:28,000 --> 01:17:29,000
Start.

691
01:17:29,000 --> 01:17:31,000
Tell me on the loud paper.

692
01:17:31,000 --> 01:17:33,000
I really forgot that people could even hear.

693
01:17:33,000 --> 01:17:35,000
I would have just been spacing out.

694
01:17:35,000 --> 01:17:37,000
Yeah, you've been totally spaced out.

695
01:17:37,000 --> 01:17:38,000
Oh fuck.

696
01:17:38,000 --> 01:17:39,000
No, I wanted to click on...

697
01:17:39,000 --> 01:17:40,000
Damn it, come on.

698
01:17:40,000 --> 01:17:41,000
Can I hold this?

699
01:17:41,000 --> 01:17:42,000
No.

700
01:17:42,000 --> 01:17:43,000
Yes, I can.

701
01:17:43,000 --> 01:17:45,000
Hey, move on to click on that again.

702
01:17:45,000 --> 01:17:48,000
You hit the baby with lightning yet.

703
01:17:48,000 --> 01:17:49,000
No.

704
01:17:49,000 --> 01:17:50,000
I have not.

705
01:17:50,000 --> 01:17:53,000
You can't do that.

706
01:17:53,000 --> 01:18:00,000
Yeah, I mean, this is a game by the guys that made the neighborhood.

707
01:18:00,000 --> 01:18:01,000
So there are...

708
01:18:01,000 --> 01:18:02,000
It's very, very much.

709
01:18:02,000 --> 01:18:05,000
You have to remember a lot of things.

710
01:18:05,000 --> 01:18:08,000
I'm in it for the long haul though.

711
01:18:08,000 --> 01:18:11,000
It might take me a little while, but I'm in it for the long haul.

712
01:18:11,000 --> 01:18:13,000
I'll be back in three weeks.

713
01:18:13,000 --> 01:18:15,000
Yeah, see you in like six months.

714
01:18:15,000 --> 01:18:18,000
You're just turning this lever.

715
01:18:18,000 --> 01:18:21,000
What do I do?

716
01:18:21,000 --> 01:18:28,000
Alright, please let me talk to the octopus as the dog in the secret world.

717
01:18:28,000 --> 01:18:31,000
That's an MMO.

718
01:18:31,000 --> 01:18:34,000
There we go.

719
01:18:34,000 --> 01:18:35,000
Hey you.

720
01:18:35,000 --> 01:18:36,000
Oh, it worked.

721
01:18:36,000 --> 01:18:38,000
Oh, it worked.

722
01:18:38,000 --> 01:18:46,000
I don't speak this language.

723
01:18:47,000 --> 01:18:53,000
I don't speak this language.

724
01:18:53,000 --> 01:19:00,000
I don't speak this language.

725
01:19:00,000 --> 01:19:03,000
Can't write this all down.

726
01:19:03,000 --> 01:19:07,000
Yeah, I don't speak this language.

727
01:19:07,000 --> 01:19:12,000
I don't speak this language.

728
01:19:12,000 --> 01:19:19,000
Can't write this all down.

729
01:19:19,000 --> 01:19:26,000
I need a good job.

730
01:19:26,000 --> 01:19:32,000
I need a good job.

731
01:19:32,000 --> 01:19:33,000
I'm a man.

732
01:19:33,000 --> 01:19:34,000
You are a man.

733
01:19:34,000 --> 01:19:35,000
I'm a man.

734
01:19:35,000 --> 01:19:36,000
I'm a man.

735
01:19:36,000 --> 01:19:37,000
I'm a man.

736
01:19:37,000 --> 01:19:38,000
I'm a man.

737
01:19:38,000 --> 01:19:39,000
I'm a man.

738
01:19:39,000 --> 01:19:40,000
I'm a man.

739
01:19:40,000 --> 01:19:41,000
I'm a man.

740
01:19:41,000 --> 01:19:42,000
I'm a man.

741
01:19:42,000 --> 01:19:43,000
I'm a man.

742
01:19:43,000 --> 01:19:44,000
I'm a man.

743
01:19:44,000 --> 01:19:45,000
I'm a man.

744
01:19:45,000 --> 01:19:46,000
I'm a man.

745
01:19:46,000 --> 01:19:47,000
I'm a man.

746
01:19:47,000 --> 01:19:48,000
I'm a man.

747
01:19:48,000 --> 01:19:49,000
I'm a man.

748
01:19:49,000 --> 01:19:50,000
I'm a man.

749
01:19:50,000 --> 01:19:51,000
I'm a man.

750
01:19:51,000 --> 01:19:52,000
I'm a man.

751
01:19:52,000 --> 01:19:53,000
I'm a man.

752
01:19:53,000 --> 01:19:54,000
I'm a man.

753
01:19:54,000 --> 01:19:55,000
I'm a man.

754
01:19:55,000 --> 01:19:56,000
I'm a man.

755
01:19:56,000 --> 01:19:57,000
I'm a man.

756
01:19:57,000 --> 01:19:58,000
I'm a man.

757
01:19:58,000 --> 01:19:59,000
I'm a man.

758
01:19:59,000 --> 01:20:00,000
I'm a man.

759
01:20:00,000 --> 01:20:01,000
I'm a man.

760
01:20:01,000 --> 01:20:03,000
Another new entertainer,

761
01:20:03,000 --> 01:20:04,000
Hasan Feed.

762
01:20:04,000 --> 01:20:05,000
O God.

763
01:20:05,000 --> 01:20:06,000
The city right,

764
01:20:06,000 --> 01:20:07,000
Gujaba Ra,

765
01:20:07,000 --> 01:20:08,000
Hasan Feed.

766
01:20:08,000 --> 01:20:10,000
Deray Aftal Ojaba.

767
01:20:10,000 --> 01:20:11,000
O God.

768
01:20:11,000 --> 01:20:12,000
O God.

769
01:20:12,000 --> 01:20:13,000
I'm a man.

770
01:20:13,000 --> 01:20:14,000
I'm a man.

771
01:20:14,000 --> 01:20:16,000
So these people were all killed?

772
01:20:16,000 --> 01:20:17,000
O lasyenas,

773
01:20:17,000 --> 01:20:18,000
the crew lay.

774
01:20:18,000 --> 01:20:19,000
Deravasi,

775
01:20:19,000 --> 01:20:20,000
in Nakh,

776
01:20:20,000 --> 01:20:21,000
the sea.

777
01:20:21,000 --> 01:20:22,000
Ua,

778
01:20:22,000 --> 01:20:23,000
Uas,

779
01:20:23,000 --> 01:20:24,000
a Ua,

780
01:20:24,000 --> 01:20:25,000
a Ura,

781
01:20:25,000 --> 01:20:26,000
a sun,

782
01:20:26,000 --> 01:20:27,000
a sun,

783
01:20:27,000 --> 01:20:28,000
a Miqas,

784
01:20:28,000 --> 01:20:29,000
a Ederdab.

785
01:20:29,000 --> 01:20:30,000
Yasi,

786
01:20:30,000 --> 01:20:33,000
his

787
01:20:33,000 --> 01:20:37,000
Mom

788
01:20:37,000 --> 01:20:47,000
and

789
01:20:47,000 --> 01:20:50,000
dead

790
01:20:50,000 --> 01:20:52,000
I'd like to hear the transcript. What is it?

791
01:20:52,000 --> 01:20:58,000
Trava Nevi, Bobby, dad, Trava Vichara, Trava, Flafi, Flafla, Trava, Flafla, Flafla, Flafla.

792
01:20:58,000 --> 01:21:00,000
Yeah, I just-

793
01:21:00,000 --> 01:21:01,000
That was just by this first part.

794
01:21:01,000 --> 01:21:03,000
Just in case I'm gonna see if-

795
01:21:03,000 --> 01:21:09,000
Why do I feel like this game would be trivial and really easy if you spoke galactic space octopus?

796
01:21:09,000 --> 01:21:11,000
I picked up a thing, right?

797
01:21:11,000 --> 01:21:15,000
Yeah, what if that entire thing just told you every single puzzle?

798
01:21:15,000 --> 01:21:18,000
It sounded like it was telling you at least two or three of them.

799
01:21:19,000 --> 01:21:21,000
I think- it probably was.

800
01:21:21,000 --> 01:21:22,000
It probably was-

801
01:21:22,000 --> 01:21:27,000
At least at the beginning it was like, okay, you use this one, this one you go here and you're gonna need that.

802
01:21:29,000 --> 01:21:31,000
Oh, it puked.

803
01:21:31,000 --> 01:21:35,000
I think my audio may have gotten screwed up.

804
01:21:37,000 --> 01:21:41,000
Yeah, I have no- the game is not making any more like sounds.

805
01:21:41,000 --> 01:21:44,000
Wow, quiet world, dude.

806
01:21:44,000 --> 01:21:46,000
Let me save it and restart it.

807
01:21:46,000 --> 01:21:47,000
I think that's-

808
01:21:47,000 --> 01:21:48,000
Yeah.

809
01:21:48,000 --> 01:21:49,000
You'll find a Cooper.

810
01:21:49,000 --> 01:21:50,000
Okay, hold on.

811
01:21:50,000 --> 01:21:52,000
Yeah, I've lost audio.

812
01:21:52,000 --> 01:21:54,000
We ran into a bug.

813
01:21:54,000 --> 01:21:59,000
There's a bug after that cutscene sometimes, maybe you lose all audio.

814
01:21:59,000 --> 01:22:03,000
Save the game.

815
01:22:07,000 --> 01:22:10,000
Audio.

816
01:22:11,000 --> 01:22:13,000
Ha, ha, ha.

817
01:22:13,000 --> 01:22:16,000
Well, it sounds back now.

818
01:22:18,000 --> 01:22:22,000
Is it just not in some places?

819
01:22:22,000 --> 01:22:27,000
Yeah, it killed the audio in random places.

820
01:22:27,000 --> 01:22:30,000
That's where that fits.

821
01:22:30,000 --> 01:22:31,000
Now I can probably press the button.

822
01:22:31,000 --> 01:22:32,000
Yeah, I want to-

823
01:22:32,000 --> 01:22:33,000
I want to-

824
01:22:33,000 --> 01:22:36,000
Hold on a second.

825
01:22:36,000 --> 01:22:39,000
Hold on, just one second.

826
01:22:39,000 --> 01:22:45,000
Should lower my volume to a little bit.

827
01:22:45,000 --> 01:22:49,000
I- I kind of can't because you're coming through the same line as the game.

828
01:22:49,000 --> 01:22:51,000
Can't you lower Skype's volume in Windows?

829
01:22:51,000 --> 01:22:53,000
I've done it.

830
01:22:53,000 --> 01:22:54,000
That is what I have done.

831
01:22:54,000 --> 01:22:57,000
Do it a little more.

832
01:22:57,000 --> 01:23:00,000
Okay, it's like-

833
01:23:00,000 --> 01:23:04,000
Shut up, shut up, shut up, shut up, shut up.

834
01:23:04,000 --> 01:23:06,000
Oh my god.

835
01:23:06,000 --> 01:23:08,000
Really, why did you draw Elmo on the screen?

836
01:23:08,000 --> 01:23:11,000
That's not Elmo.

837
01:23:11,000 --> 01:23:12,000
Is it you?

838
01:23:12,000 --> 01:23:13,000
Is it supposed to be you?

839
01:23:13,000 --> 01:23:14,000
You're not that handsome.

840
01:23:14,000 --> 01:23:17,000
Hey, I am that handsome.

841
01:23:17,000 --> 01:23:24,000
I am that handsome with my funny eyes and funny nose and big mouth.

842
01:23:24,000 --> 01:23:27,000
It's kind of a llama mouth.

843
01:23:27,000 --> 01:23:29,000
I've turned you down to like 10%.

844
01:23:29,000 --> 01:23:32,000
And the next one, I don't know if it's going to help.

845
01:23:32,000 --> 01:23:34,000
Should have done zero.

846
01:23:34,000 --> 01:23:35,000
Zero.

847
01:23:35,000 --> 01:23:37,000
All right, let me reload again.

848
01:23:38,000 --> 01:23:41,000
Let's hope we have-

849
01:23:41,000 --> 01:23:42,000
Hey, look at that.

850
01:23:42,000 --> 01:23:44,000
We got audio again.

851
01:23:44,000 --> 01:23:55,000
What is switch event away that like if you clap or laugh, like you can hear the laugh track.

852
01:23:55,000 --> 01:23:57,000
You can hear everyone's laughs.

853
01:23:57,000 --> 01:24:00,000
But if they say words, it like you can't get them through.

854
01:24:00,000 --> 01:24:02,000
It's only claps and laughs.

855
01:24:02,000 --> 01:24:03,000
Now I can press the buttons.

856
01:24:03,000 --> 01:24:05,000
See, I couldn't- there we are.

857
01:24:05,000 --> 01:24:08,000
All right.

858
01:24:08,000 --> 01:24:11,000
We did it.

859
01:24:11,000 --> 01:24:14,000
I didn't do anything.

860
01:24:14,000 --> 01:24:20,000
That's really cool looking.

861
01:24:20,000 --> 01:24:23,000
That's so cool.

862
01:24:23,000 --> 01:24:27,000
Now I can use the thing and fly around.

863
01:24:27,000 --> 01:24:30,000
And fly around on the go kart.

864
01:24:30,000 --> 01:24:33,000
Oh, wait a minute.

865
01:24:33,000 --> 01:24:37,000
There we go.

866
01:24:37,000 --> 01:24:40,000
We're both in here.

867
01:24:40,000 --> 01:24:44,000
Wow, yeah, this is great.

868
01:24:44,000 --> 01:24:47,000
I'm going to go to the back.

869
01:24:47,000 --> 01:24:50,000
I'm going to go to the back.

870
01:24:50,000 --> 01:24:52,000
I'm going to go to the back.

871
01:24:52,000 --> 01:24:54,000
I'm going to go to the back.

872
01:24:54,000 --> 01:24:58,000
Wow, yeah, this is great.

873
01:24:58,000 --> 01:25:01,000
Let's move.

874
01:25:01,000 --> 01:25:12,000
I remember this was in the neighborhood.

875
01:25:12,000 --> 01:25:21,000
This is so cool.

876
01:25:21,000 --> 01:25:27,000
I'm going to go to the back.

877
01:25:27,000 --> 01:25:30,000
It looks like there's a little spot to go in.

878
01:25:30,000 --> 01:25:34,000
Hey, look, remember that thing that I already got?

879
01:25:34,000 --> 01:25:43,000
I already guessed it.

880
01:25:43,000 --> 01:25:48,000
So that's a- I like was a step ahead.

881
01:25:49,000 --> 01:25:52,000
This is where I go that way, though.

882
01:25:52,000 --> 01:25:57,000
How do I get up there?

883
01:25:57,000 --> 01:26:01,000
Well, we're going to go all the way around.

884
01:26:01,000 --> 01:26:04,000
Wee!

885
01:26:04,000 --> 01:26:08,000
Hopefully this weird octopus lady doesn't say anything strange to me.

886
01:26:08,000 --> 01:26:12,000
She's going to go like,

887
01:26:12,000 --> 01:26:19,000
what the hell that means?

888
01:26:19,000 --> 01:26:25,000
Let's keep going.

889
01:26:25,000 --> 01:26:32,000
Ah.

890
01:26:32,000 --> 01:26:35,000
Oh, do it again.

891
01:26:35,000 --> 01:26:37,000
I'm going to go down first.

892
01:26:37,000 --> 01:26:40,000
Just in case it's something down here.

893
01:26:40,000 --> 01:26:41,000
Shit.

894
01:26:41,000 --> 01:26:42,000
Nevermind.

895
01:26:42,000 --> 01:26:49,000
I'm going to go up.

896
01:26:49,000 --> 01:26:55,000
Go on.

897
01:26:55,000 --> 01:27:02,000
Those are symbols from these.

898
01:27:02,000 --> 01:27:07,000
I remember the bush.

899
01:27:07,000 --> 01:27:09,000
Let's speed through this.

900
01:27:09,000 --> 01:27:12,000
Can I go down?

901
01:27:12,000 --> 01:27:13,000
Maybe?

902
01:27:13,000 --> 01:27:14,000
I wonder.

903
01:27:14,000 --> 01:27:15,000
Nope.

904
01:27:15,000 --> 01:27:18,000
I'm going to keep going to the right.

905
01:27:18,000 --> 01:27:27,000
New area.

906
01:27:27,000 --> 01:27:29,000
Because of that's how you go in here.

907
01:27:29,000 --> 01:27:36,000
So we're not going to do that yet.

908
01:27:37,000 --> 01:27:39,000
Uh.

909
01:27:39,000 --> 01:27:50,000
Well, here we go.

910
01:27:50,000 --> 01:27:54,000
I obviously have to put this down there.

911
01:27:54,000 --> 01:28:01,000
Okay, this is going to take me a minute.

912
01:28:02,000 --> 01:28:08,000
I only have one going at a time.

913
01:28:08,000 --> 01:28:14,000
Only one can fit in at a time.

914
01:28:14,000 --> 01:28:20,000
You definitely have to clear out the bottom.

915
01:28:20,000 --> 01:28:29,000
This one's going to be tough.

916
01:28:29,000 --> 01:28:34,000
I'm going to get them all over on one side, I think.

917
01:28:34,000 --> 01:28:45,000
For instance, this is going to go all down here first, maybe.

918
01:28:45,000 --> 01:28:51,000
Shit.

919
01:28:51,000 --> 01:28:58,000
All three of those can go up here now, right?

920
01:28:58,000 --> 01:29:03,000
I don't know.

921
01:29:03,000 --> 01:29:04,000
Where's the bottom?

922
01:29:04,000 --> 01:29:06,000
Bottom's over there.

923
01:29:06,000 --> 01:29:21,000
Let's get the bottom out.

924
01:29:21,000 --> 01:29:26,000
Get the bottom out first.

925
01:29:26,000 --> 01:29:33,000
Let me talk to them.

926
01:29:33,000 --> 01:29:36,000
You're having trouble.

927
01:29:36,000 --> 01:29:41,000
Hey, you're the one having trouble.

928
01:29:41,000 --> 01:29:46,000
Oh, shit.

929
01:29:46,000 --> 01:29:49,000
I think I actually can move this one here.

930
01:29:49,000 --> 01:29:52,000
Want to talk about a German?

931
01:29:52,000 --> 01:29:58,000
I did kind of screw myself with that.

932
01:29:58,000 --> 01:29:59,000
Actually, no, not really.

933
01:29:59,000 --> 01:30:01,000
Now I can just do that.

934
01:30:01,000 --> 01:30:04,000
I bet if you used the baby, you could just skip this.

935
01:30:04,000 --> 01:30:06,000
Maybe.

936
01:30:06,000 --> 01:30:09,000
Maybe, maybe.

937
01:30:09,000 --> 01:30:12,000
Complete.

938
01:30:12,000 --> 01:30:14,000
Hey, you having some trouble, star?

939
01:30:14,000 --> 01:30:15,000
Me?

940
01:30:15,000 --> 01:30:16,000
No, I did it.

941
01:30:16,000 --> 01:30:18,000
Why would I be having trouble?

942
01:30:18,000 --> 01:30:20,000
I don't know.

943
01:30:20,000 --> 01:30:27,000
Is there a trouble, some per- another one of these octopus people?

944
01:30:27,000 --> 01:30:29,000
Is it a dog?

945
01:30:29,000 --> 01:30:30,000
Food bowl?

946
01:30:30,000 --> 01:30:31,000
Is it dog bowl?

947
01:30:31,000 --> 01:30:32,000
Eat out of that dog bowl.

948
01:30:32,000 --> 01:30:39,000
I command you.

949
01:30:39,000 --> 01:30:49,000
Up here looks like a haunted house.

950
01:30:49,000 --> 01:30:56,000
Grass coming over here.

951
01:30:56,000 --> 01:30:59,000
I'm assuming something's going to come out of there in land and he's going to eat it.

952
01:30:59,000 --> 01:31:07,000
Just how do you want to take a look at the rooms?

953
01:31:07,000 --> 01:31:16,000
Hmm.

954
01:31:16,000 --> 01:31:18,000
Interesting.

955
01:31:18,000 --> 01:31:22,000
Doesn't seem to be doing anything at the moment.

956
01:31:22,000 --> 01:31:30,000
You have to turn it on.

957
01:31:30,000 --> 01:31:34,000
Can you grab that dude?

958
01:31:34,000 --> 01:31:47,000
Do you want to pull the lever?

959
01:31:47,000 --> 01:31:53,000
Is there a reason why you don't want to do that?

960
01:31:53,000 --> 01:31:55,000
Okay.

961
01:31:55,000 --> 01:31:56,000
Okay.

962
01:31:56,000 --> 01:32:00,000
Let's see what's in this room.

963
01:32:00,000 --> 01:32:02,000
Yeah, looks kind of familiar.

964
01:32:02,000 --> 01:32:09,000
Here's this guy again.

965
01:32:09,000 --> 01:32:16,000
Okay, inspire others to great heights and your objectives shall be reached.

966
01:32:16,000 --> 01:32:22,000
Okay, inspire others to great heights and your objectives shall be reached.

967
01:32:22,000 --> 01:32:24,000
You didn't say it again.

968
01:32:24,000 --> 01:32:32,000
Totally shit.

969
01:32:32,000 --> 01:32:36,000
You want to read a whole book?

970
01:32:36,000 --> 01:32:43,000
Oh man, this is a long.

971
01:32:43,000 --> 01:32:50,000
This is a lot of lore.

972
01:32:50,000 --> 01:32:53,000
What if I had to read this whole thing to figure out a certain puzzle?

973
01:32:53,000 --> 01:32:54,000
I probably will.

974
01:32:54,000 --> 01:33:00,000
Knowing these guys, I probably will have to read this whole thing.

975
01:33:00,000 --> 01:33:03,000
Well, we'll find out if I need to or not.

976
01:33:03,000 --> 01:33:04,000
Write it down.

977
01:33:04,000 --> 01:33:11,000
Write down that entire script.

978
01:33:11,000 --> 01:33:16,000
Well, let's just have him stand on that and see what happens.

979
01:33:16,000 --> 01:33:31,000
Maybe I can just stand on it.

980
01:33:31,000 --> 01:33:34,000
Turn the lights off.

981
01:33:34,000 --> 01:33:36,000
I'm just going to keep him there.

982
01:33:36,000 --> 01:33:42,000
Maybe he can stay there.

983
01:33:42,000 --> 01:33:49,000
Alright.

984
01:33:49,000 --> 01:33:56,000
I pull the lever now.

985
01:33:56,000 --> 01:34:02,000
Jesus.

986
01:34:02,000 --> 01:34:12,000
I'm not even sure where to start here.

987
01:34:12,000 --> 01:34:25,000
Is there some color coding that needs to be thought of here?

988
01:34:25,000 --> 01:34:33,000
Let's go from room to room to see.

989
01:34:33,000 --> 01:34:35,000
Well, these are symbols.

990
01:34:35,000 --> 01:34:41,000
I don't know if these mean anything, but they probably do.

991
01:34:41,000 --> 01:34:51,000
And they're wearing things too.

992
01:34:51,000 --> 01:34:54,000
It needs astronaut has to be the right.

993
01:34:54,000 --> 01:34:55,000
Let's pull this again.

994
01:34:55,000 --> 01:34:57,000
Let's see what happens.

995
01:34:57,000 --> 01:35:05,000
Kind of scrambles it a little bit.

996
01:35:05,000 --> 01:35:09,000
I'm going to go outside here because I haven't been out here since the...

997
01:35:09,000 --> 01:35:13,000
It's been dark.

998
01:35:13,000 --> 01:35:19,000
I guess it doesn't really affect out here that much.

999
01:35:19,000 --> 01:35:30,000
I'm going to turn the lights back on because they had badges.

1000
01:35:30,000 --> 01:35:41,000
Turn the lights back on.

1001
01:35:41,000 --> 01:35:42,000
Okay.

1002
01:35:42,000 --> 01:35:45,000
Big peak.

1003
01:35:45,000 --> 01:35:46,000
Green.

1004
01:35:46,000 --> 01:35:47,000
Guess what, guys?

1005
01:35:47,000 --> 01:35:49,000
Hey, guess what?

1006
01:35:49,000 --> 01:35:51,000
Write it down.

1007
01:35:51,000 --> 01:35:54,000
Green.

1008
01:35:54,000 --> 01:35:56,000
Red.

1009
01:35:56,000 --> 01:35:57,000
Purple.

1010
01:35:57,000 --> 01:35:59,000
Blue.

1011
01:35:59,000 --> 01:36:00,000
Yellow.

1012
01:36:00,000 --> 01:36:05,000
Orange-ish.

1013
01:36:05,000 --> 01:36:08,000
Line those up.

1014
01:36:08,000 --> 01:36:16,000
Somehow by using your skills of deduction.

1015
01:36:17,000 --> 01:36:21,000
Still don't know what this does.

1016
01:36:21,000 --> 01:36:27,000
Star, are you going to contribute or what?

1017
01:36:27,000 --> 01:36:30,000
I don't think he's even here.

1018
01:36:30,000 --> 01:36:36,000
I don't think he's here.

1019
01:36:36,000 --> 01:36:45,000
Let's just see what happens.

1020
01:36:45,000 --> 01:36:50,000
Wait a second.

1021
01:36:50,000 --> 01:36:53,000
Is it combining the colors?

1022
01:36:53,000 --> 01:36:56,000
I think it's combining them to make these colors.

1023
01:36:56,000 --> 01:37:02,000
Let's see.

1024
01:37:02,000 --> 01:37:05,000
This is correct.

1025
01:37:05,000 --> 01:37:07,000
I didn't think it couldn't buy.

1026
01:37:07,000 --> 01:37:09,000
Are you leaving?

1027
01:37:09,000 --> 01:37:15,000
I'm going to go tell Ash.

1028
01:37:15,000 --> 01:37:16,000
Green.

1029
01:37:16,000 --> 01:37:18,000
Okay, got that one.

1030
01:37:18,000 --> 01:37:23,000
Look, you haven't even said all you told me to do was strike the baby with lightning.

1031
01:37:23,000 --> 01:37:26,000
Oh, good.

1032
01:37:26,000 --> 01:37:28,000
That was great advice.

1033
01:37:28,000 --> 01:37:32,000
These are color coded and then some way you're going to have to line them up.

1034
01:37:32,000 --> 01:37:34,000
What do you think I'm doing?

1035
01:37:34,000 --> 01:37:37,000
What do you want me to tell you?

1036
01:37:37,000 --> 01:37:42,000
I didn't even need star's help.

1037
01:37:42,000 --> 01:37:47,000
Get out of here.

1038
01:37:47,000 --> 01:37:50,000
Can I have you listen to this?

1039
01:37:50,000 --> 01:37:53,000
I can have a story on the top of one.

1040
01:37:53,000 --> 01:38:01,000
I didn't think you were going to get by.

1041
01:38:01,000 --> 01:38:04,000
Waiting for a story.

1042
01:38:04,000 --> 01:38:11,000
If you want a story, read the one on the wall.

1043
01:38:11,000 --> 01:38:17,000
Oh, do it.

1044
01:38:17,000 --> 01:38:21,000
Everyone wants to hear it.

1045
01:38:21,000 --> 01:38:23,000
No, no, no, it's a lot.

1046
01:38:23,000 --> 01:38:25,000
It's a long, long, long.

1047
01:38:25,000 --> 01:38:31,000
You're like not going to want to talk again after you do it.

1048
01:38:31,000 --> 01:38:34,000
Another one of these guys.

1049
01:38:34,000 --> 01:38:37,000
Hold on, we get a great song.

1050
01:38:37,000 --> 01:38:39,000
Hold on.

1051
01:38:39,000 --> 01:38:46,000
I need to listen to this.

1052
01:38:46,000 --> 01:38:57,000
It's got an accordion.

1053
01:38:57,000 --> 01:38:59,000
This music is so great.

1054
01:38:59,000 --> 01:39:12,000
Terry Scott Taylor, you are genius.

1055
01:39:12,000 --> 01:39:14,000
I'm going to push this in the other room.

1056
01:39:14,000 --> 01:39:17,000
Can I look out here?

1057
01:39:17,000 --> 01:39:20,000
I can't look out the window.

1058
01:39:20,000 --> 01:39:26,000
I want to get down.

1059
01:39:26,000 --> 01:39:29,000
I can't push him.

1060
01:39:29,000 --> 01:39:32,000
I like to go down here.

1061
01:39:32,000 --> 01:39:35,000
I guess not.

1062
01:39:35,000 --> 01:39:40,000
I can't even push him.

1063
01:39:40,000 --> 01:39:44,000
I really want, somebody saying I want one of these.

1064
01:39:44,000 --> 01:39:47,000
It'd be cool to have one of these.

1065
01:39:47,000 --> 01:39:49,000
Something to put on your desk.

1066
01:39:49,000 --> 01:39:51,000
A paperweight.

1067
01:39:51,000 --> 01:39:55,000
What did that, I got a lever.

1068
01:39:55,000 --> 01:40:04,000
A lever in the first room.

1069
01:40:04,000 --> 01:40:11,000
That allowed me to get the lever to put into something here.

1070
01:40:11,000 --> 01:40:15,000
Maybe.

1071
01:40:15,000 --> 01:40:18,000
No, no.

1072
01:40:18,000 --> 01:40:22,000
I just want to make sure there's nothing out here that I missed.

1073
01:40:23,000 --> 01:40:27,000
Besides the weird birds.

1074
01:40:27,000 --> 01:40:31,000
I actually am going to write this down.

1075
01:40:31,000 --> 01:40:33,000
See this octopus?

1076
01:40:33,000 --> 01:40:36,000
This purple octopus has this symbol.

1077
01:40:36,000 --> 01:40:41,000
We're going to say P-Octo.

1078
01:40:41,000 --> 01:40:43,000
I'm going to draw that.

1079
01:40:43,000 --> 01:40:45,000
P-Octo.

1080
01:40:45,000 --> 01:40:49,000
This first symbol.

1081
01:40:49,000 --> 01:40:52,000
The other one was orange, right?

1082
01:40:52,000 --> 01:40:55,000
It was an orange octo.

1083
01:40:55,000 --> 01:40:57,000
It orange lives.

1084
01:40:57,000 --> 01:41:00,000
He had the rectangle.

1085
01:41:00,000 --> 01:41:03,000
Oh, octo.

1086
01:41:03,000 --> 01:41:06,000
I had the rectangle.

1087
01:41:06,000 --> 01:41:14,000
Okay, let's go down.

1088
01:41:14,000 --> 01:41:17,000
Just make sure I can't go any further.

1089
01:41:17,000 --> 01:41:20,000
There is another area.

1090
01:41:20,000 --> 01:41:23,000
Another power symbol.

1091
01:41:23,000 --> 01:41:26,000
Let's start at the bottom.

1092
01:41:26,000 --> 01:41:29,000
And there's a lever.

1093
01:41:29,000 --> 01:41:32,000
What?

1094
01:41:32,000 --> 01:41:35,000
The lever doesn't go here.

1095
01:41:35,000 --> 01:41:39,000
Are you kidding me?

1096
01:41:39,000 --> 01:41:41,000
Are you kidding me?

1097
01:41:41,000 --> 01:41:45,000
The lever doesn't go there.

1098
01:41:45,000 --> 01:41:48,000
I can't do anything here.

1099
01:41:48,000 --> 01:41:51,000
I need another lever.

1100
01:41:51,000 --> 01:41:54,000
You're progressing too far.

1101
01:41:54,000 --> 01:41:57,000
There were things I didn't do in the other room.

1102
01:41:57,000 --> 01:42:00,000
You got backtracking.

1103
01:42:00,000 --> 01:42:05,000
You got to go backwards at some point.

1104
01:42:05,000 --> 01:42:09,000
This is so cool.

1105
01:42:09,000 --> 01:42:12,000
This is bird shit.

1106
01:42:12,000 --> 01:42:15,000
I love stuff like this.

1107
01:42:15,000 --> 01:42:20,000
This is probably real bird shit.

1108
01:42:20,000 --> 01:42:25,000
That's a place for a lever.

1109
01:42:25,000 --> 01:42:34,000
Whoa.

1110
01:42:34,000 --> 01:42:45,000
That was cool.

1111
01:42:45,000 --> 01:42:47,000
That was really cool.

1112
01:42:47,000 --> 01:42:54,000
It just stretched out the accordion room.

1113
01:42:54,000 --> 01:42:57,000
Hey, I remember this.

1114
01:42:57,000 --> 01:42:59,000
We wrote it down.

1115
01:42:59,000 --> 01:43:01,000
And what was it?

1116
01:43:01,000 --> 01:43:04,000
Oh, fuck.

1117
01:43:04,000 --> 01:43:06,000
What are you?

1118
01:43:06,000 --> 01:43:07,000
Come on.

1119
01:43:07,000 --> 01:43:11,000
Two, three, one.

1120
01:43:11,000 --> 01:43:12,000
What?

1121
01:43:12,000 --> 01:43:18,000
Oh.

1122
01:43:18,000 --> 01:43:24,000
It's got to be the right color too.

1123
01:43:24,000 --> 01:43:27,000
It's got to be the right colors.

1124
01:43:27,000 --> 01:43:33,000
Okay.

1125
01:43:33,000 --> 01:43:36,000
I actually don't know.

1126
01:43:36,000 --> 01:43:40,000
This has been just shown up a couple times, I think.

1127
01:43:40,000 --> 01:43:42,000
Well, we can't do this one yet.

1128
01:43:42,000 --> 01:43:45,000
I need to know what the colors are.

1129
01:43:45,000 --> 01:43:48,000
Can I do anything with these birds?

1130
01:43:48,000 --> 01:43:50,000
Let me save it.

1131
01:43:50,000 --> 01:43:53,000
I want to make sure I save the game often.

1132
01:43:53,000 --> 01:43:55,000
There is an auto save.

1133
01:43:55,000 --> 01:43:56,000
I never know.

1134
01:43:56,000 --> 01:44:02,000
It could run into like a crash.

1135
01:44:02,000 --> 01:44:06,000
The colors.

1136
01:44:06,000 --> 01:44:09,000
Actually, I'm going to write the symbols down to.

1137
01:44:09,000 --> 01:44:13,000
Because that would make sense, right?

1138
01:44:13,000 --> 01:44:15,000
My notebook is all screwed up.

1139
01:44:15,000 --> 01:44:16,000
I got scribbles everywhere.

1140
01:44:16,000 --> 01:44:19,000
This is not right.

1141
01:44:19,000 --> 01:44:22,000
The colors.

1142
01:44:22,000 --> 01:44:24,000
I'm going to write it all.

1143
01:44:24,000 --> 01:44:28,000
This is just incorrect.

1144
01:44:28,000 --> 01:44:35,000
Squirrely symbol with the crown.

1145
01:44:35,000 --> 01:44:42,000
Then we got giant mustache.

1146
01:44:42,000 --> 01:44:45,000
And then we got the shoe.

1147
01:44:45,000 --> 01:44:51,000
That looks like a shoe kind of like a Yoshi foot.

1148
01:44:51,000 --> 01:44:54,000
Okay.

1149
01:44:54,000 --> 01:45:01,000
Let's go back.

1150
01:45:01,000 --> 01:45:05,000
Everything in here might have changed as well.

1151
01:45:05,000 --> 01:45:09,000
It did.

1152
01:45:09,000 --> 01:45:14,000
Look at the color.

1153
01:45:14,000 --> 01:45:17,000
Dude.

1154
01:45:17,000 --> 01:45:19,000
Here is another power machine.

1155
01:45:19,000 --> 01:45:26,000
I'm assuming I have to get it from the octopus.

1156
01:45:26,000 --> 01:45:32,000
Yeah, check out the color.

1157
01:45:32,000 --> 01:45:33,000
That's blue.

1158
01:45:33,000 --> 01:45:34,000
That's blue.

1159
01:45:34,000 --> 01:45:40,000
That's blue button, ain't it?

1160
01:45:40,000 --> 01:45:47,000
A lot of rooms here.

1161
01:45:47,000 --> 01:45:54,000
I'm almost Jefferson.

1162
01:45:54,000 --> 01:46:00,000
I have to sign the declaration of independence.

1163
01:46:00,000 --> 01:46:05,000
I need it to be my quill.

1164
01:46:05,000 --> 01:46:08,000
There they are.

1165
01:46:08,000 --> 01:46:11,000
Oh, it's like doing the subtitles now.

1166
01:46:11,000 --> 01:46:14,000
Okay, it was purple green.

1167
01:46:14,000 --> 01:46:16,000
Purple green yellow.

1168
01:46:16,000 --> 01:46:23,000
Got the colors.

1169
01:46:23,000 --> 01:46:30,000
We got the colors boys and girls.

1170
01:46:30,000 --> 01:46:40,000
Thomas Jefferson.

1171
01:46:40,000 --> 01:46:43,000
Now what the hell does that do?

1172
01:46:43,000 --> 01:46:48,000
Hey, remember what the colors were.

1173
01:46:48,000 --> 01:46:50,000
I'm assuming that turns on this vacuum.

1174
01:46:50,000 --> 01:46:57,000
That can't be turned on because there's no power.

1175
01:46:57,000 --> 01:46:59,000
Stretching.

1176
01:46:59,000 --> 01:47:06,000
Yeah, I was remembering the colors.

1177
01:47:06,000 --> 01:47:08,000
Yeah, what the hell?

1178
01:47:08,000 --> 01:47:11,000
You're just like saying you're repeating yourself very slowly.

1179
01:47:11,000 --> 01:47:18,000
Purple green and yellow.

1180
01:47:18,000 --> 01:47:19,000
Oh, shit.

1181
01:47:19,000 --> 01:47:21,000
No, purple.

1182
01:47:21,000 --> 01:47:23,000
You messed it up and that's all I've been talking about.

1183
01:47:23,000 --> 01:47:24,000
Well, I'm trying to concentrate.

1184
01:47:24,000 --> 01:47:28,000
And there's a guy just like going.

1185
01:47:28,000 --> 01:47:30,000
Green yellow.

1186
01:47:30,000 --> 01:47:31,000
Do I vote him?

1187
01:47:31,000 --> 01:47:32,000
What do you guys think?

1188
01:47:32,000 --> 01:47:33,000
Should I?

1189
01:47:33,000 --> 01:47:36,000
I vote him before I like I already clicked it.

1190
01:47:36,000 --> 01:47:37,000
But I mean, do you want to get voted?

1191
01:47:37,000 --> 01:47:40,000
Oh, what?

1192
01:47:40,000 --> 01:47:42,000
I don't deserve that kind of truth.

1193
01:47:42,000 --> 01:47:46,000
There's the quill.

1194
01:47:46,000 --> 01:47:48,000
Let's go back to Thomas Jefferson.

1195
01:47:48,000 --> 01:47:51,000
Give Thomas Jefferson the quill.

1196
01:47:51,000 --> 01:47:53,000
I'm seeing a lot of yeses.

1197
01:47:53,000 --> 01:48:05,000
I'm seeing a lot of yes, boedal.

1198
01:48:05,000 --> 01:48:09,000
What does he do with the quill?

1199
01:48:09,000 --> 01:48:16,000
Is he going to write me a parchment?

1200
01:48:16,000 --> 01:48:19,000
You say the colors one more time like that.

1201
01:48:19,000 --> 01:48:20,000
And you're gone.

1202
01:48:20,000 --> 01:48:21,000
You're out of here.

1203
01:48:21,000 --> 01:48:23,000
I have to go to the bathroom.

1204
01:48:23,000 --> 01:48:24,000
You're such a lame.

1205
01:48:24,000 --> 01:48:25,000
We're gonna miss you.

1206
01:48:25,000 --> 01:48:26,000
Let's go.

1207
01:48:26,000 --> 01:48:27,000
Quill to pay for.

1208
01:48:27,000 --> 01:48:34,000
Send to Tennany.

1209
01:48:34,000 --> 01:48:38,000
What does that mean?

1210
01:48:38,000 --> 01:48:45,000
I guess we're gonna murder them.

1211
01:48:45,000 --> 01:49:02,000
I don't know what it means, but it's like a constellation kind of.

1212
01:49:02,000 --> 01:49:05,000
You talk to the ant president so you could get it.

1213
01:49:05,000 --> 01:49:11,000
There's definitely going to be like a George Washington or something like George Washington ant.

1214
01:49:11,000 --> 01:49:14,000
Is that it?

1215
01:49:14,000 --> 01:49:17,000
Actually, I want to see what the colors on that.

1216
01:49:17,000 --> 01:49:24,000
Yeah, I wish I could vote you, but I can't.

1217
01:49:24,000 --> 01:49:29,000
I guess the colors don't matter here.

1218
01:49:29,000 --> 01:49:32,000
In Congress today.

1219
01:49:32,000 --> 01:49:39,000
Okay.

1220
01:49:39,000 --> 01:49:41,000
Yes, this is made.

1221
01:49:41,000 --> 01:49:46,000
The creator of Earthworm Jim did make all these characters and he's like the creator.

1222
01:49:46,000 --> 01:49:48,000
Co-creator, I guess.

1223
01:49:48,000 --> 01:49:52,000
There's another bunch of people that worked on it.

1224
01:49:52,000 --> 01:49:56,000
What does that do for me?

1225
01:49:56,000 --> 01:50:02,000
There's a bunch of rooms I still haven't gone in.

1226
01:50:02,000 --> 01:50:04,000
Wasn't there something?

1227
01:50:04,000 --> 01:50:07,000
Oh, shit.

1228
01:50:07,000 --> 01:50:08,000
That's a symbol.

1229
01:50:08,000 --> 01:50:09,000
Write it down.

1230
01:50:09,000 --> 01:50:11,000
What color is it?

1231
01:50:11,000 --> 01:50:16,000
Well, I, uh, something I, uh, something is a speaking of ants.

1232
01:50:16,000 --> 01:50:21,000
There's, there's an ant that's bothering me right now and he's about to get booted.

1233
01:50:21,000 --> 01:50:23,000
So, you know, let's give him a countdown.

1234
01:50:23,000 --> 01:50:24,000
Oh my god.

1235
01:50:24,000 --> 01:50:30,000
If you'd end up needing to know what color that symbol was, you're gonna, you're really gonna regret this.

1236
01:50:30,000 --> 01:50:31,000
Wait, what?

1237
01:50:31,000 --> 01:50:36,000
It's just like a Soviet.

1238
01:50:36,000 --> 01:50:47,000
He's God, baby.

1239
01:50:47,000 --> 01:50:59,000
Let me write this down.

1240
01:50:59,000 --> 01:51:05,000
He really wanted to get that last word too.

1241
01:51:05,000 --> 01:51:08,000
It's just like a ship.

1242
01:51:08,000 --> 01:51:13,000
Yeah, poor, poor drunk star.

1243
01:51:13,000 --> 01:51:15,000
He had the kid somewhere to go anyways.

1244
01:51:15,000 --> 01:51:16,000
He needs to go eat food.

1245
01:51:16,000 --> 01:51:20,000
Yeah, get, why don't you get shocked, jocked.

1246
01:51:20,000 --> 01:51:23,000
Climb back up.

1247
01:51:23,000 --> 01:51:30,000
Oh, damn.

1248
01:51:30,000 --> 01:51:34,000
Can we go par?

1249
01:51:34,000 --> 01:51:40,000
How does he get up there?

1250
01:51:40,000 --> 01:51:42,000
He told me to be, to be fair, right?

1251
01:51:42,000 --> 01:51:43,000
To be fair.

1252
01:51:43,000 --> 01:51:49,000
He was just typing very loudly and then would just say the colors.

1253
01:51:49,000 --> 01:51:51,000
Maybe what am I supposed to, what am I supposed to say?

1254
01:51:51,000 --> 01:52:00,000
You get booted.

1255
01:52:00,000 --> 01:52:03,000
That is that, that, okay, so that's where the dog comes out.

1256
01:52:03,000 --> 01:52:06,000
You talk to the person.

1257
01:52:06,000 --> 01:52:12,000
Is there a dog hole I didn't go into?

1258
01:52:12,000 --> 01:52:15,000
Go back up here.

1259
01:52:15,000 --> 01:52:18,000
He was writing things down.

1260
01:52:18,000 --> 01:52:21,000
He was writing things down.

1261
01:52:21,000 --> 01:52:22,000
No dog hole here.

1262
01:52:22,000 --> 01:52:28,000
That doesn't bring it back up.

1263
01:52:28,000 --> 01:52:35,000
I need to see what I can do.

1264
01:52:35,000 --> 01:52:54,000
Can you go in the sewer?

1265
01:52:54,000 --> 01:52:59,000
Yeah, we need a dog hole.

1266
01:52:59,000 --> 01:53:04,000
Maybe did I miss one that was done here?

1267
01:53:04,000 --> 01:53:06,000
There was a button to press.

1268
01:53:06,000 --> 01:53:08,000
I'm gonna get that from that lady.

1269
01:53:08,000 --> 01:53:14,000
I'm gonna get...

1270
01:53:14,000 --> 01:53:16,000
Shit.

1271
01:53:16,000 --> 01:53:18,000
Where is there another dog hole?

1272
01:53:18,000 --> 01:53:23,000
Maybe...

1273
01:53:25,000 --> 01:53:31,000
Hey, Sean, what's going on, dude?

1274
01:53:36,000 --> 01:53:38,000
Did anybody see a dog hole?

1275
01:53:38,000 --> 01:53:40,000
There was the exit from the dog hole.

1276
01:53:40,000 --> 01:53:44,000
Maybe I can't climb it and put them through.

1277
01:53:44,000 --> 01:53:45,000
And there's no power.

1278
01:53:45,000 --> 01:53:51,000
There won't be power until I talk to the octopus person.

1279
01:53:51,000 --> 01:53:56,000
Whoa, whoa, whoa, hold on just a second here.

1280
01:53:56,000 --> 01:53:58,000
Oh, I got it.

1281
01:53:58,000 --> 01:54:00,000
Hold on.

1282
01:54:00,000 --> 01:54:02,000
Whoa, no, no, no, no.

1283
01:54:02,000 --> 01:54:05,000
I gotta make that symbol.

1284
01:54:05,000 --> 01:54:13,000
The symbol is from here.

1285
01:54:13,000 --> 01:54:15,000
I need to determine where these guys are moving

1286
01:54:15,000 --> 01:54:19,000
because I wrote that symbol down.

1287
01:54:19,000 --> 01:54:23,000
That's the first one, right?

1288
01:54:23,000 --> 01:54:32,000
No, it goes down to the right.

1289
01:54:32,000 --> 01:54:37,000
No, that's not it.

1290
01:54:37,000 --> 01:54:43,000
Hmm.

1291
01:54:43,000 --> 01:54:48,000
I had him in the right spot.

1292
01:54:49,000 --> 01:54:52,000
Well, what determines where they move?

1293
01:54:52,000 --> 01:54:56,000
Is that just the empty spot?

1294
01:54:56,000 --> 01:54:59,000
Because it goes right, left, right up.

1295
01:54:59,000 --> 01:55:05,000
So it would go bang, bang, bang, bang, right?

1296
01:55:05,000 --> 01:55:14,000
Oh, this can move too, shit.

1297
01:55:14,000 --> 01:55:21,000
Maybe it's the laser has to come out.

1298
01:55:21,000 --> 01:55:28,000
Okay.

1299
01:55:28,000 --> 01:55:32,000
Just to go right.

1300
01:55:32,000 --> 01:55:36,000
That?

1301
01:55:36,000 --> 01:55:43,000
No.

1302
01:55:44,000 --> 01:55:55,000
I'm trying to determine, is the white line the one that's active or the black line?

1303
01:55:55,000 --> 01:55:58,000
That's almost there.

1304
01:55:58,000 --> 01:56:00,000
This has to go down this way.

1305
01:56:00,000 --> 01:56:19,000
Right now it was going like that instead.

1306
01:56:19,000 --> 01:56:20,000
You know what I mean?

1307
01:56:20,000 --> 01:56:28,000
Like this way, this way, that way, that way.

1308
01:56:28,000 --> 01:56:35,000
It determines if they connect.

1309
01:56:35,000 --> 01:56:40,000
So maybe his mouth.

1310
01:56:40,000 --> 01:56:54,000
Yeah, every time it's from his mouth.

1311
01:56:54,000 --> 01:57:01,000
That's like it, but it's not the right way.

1312
01:57:01,000 --> 01:57:04,000
It's like upside down.

1313
01:57:04,000 --> 01:57:19,000
I'm assuming I have to shoot the laser into the mouth.

1314
01:57:19,000 --> 01:57:24,000
I just don't know how to get it the way I want it.

1315
01:57:24,000 --> 01:57:34,000
Am I trying to make it shoot into his mouth or have him go backwards?

1316
01:57:34,000 --> 01:57:47,000
Hold on.

1317
01:57:47,000 --> 01:57:50,000
I just do that.

1318
01:57:50,000 --> 01:57:55,000
I feel like there's some connection there.

1319
01:57:55,000 --> 01:58:09,000
I can't move this one now.

1320
01:58:09,000 --> 01:58:12,000
I feel like I have to get this one up there.

1321
01:58:12,000 --> 01:58:19,000
Then he has to be over here.

1322
01:58:19,000 --> 01:58:22,000
So once he's here, that's the end.

1323
01:58:22,000 --> 01:58:25,000
This is the end right here.

1324
01:58:25,000 --> 01:58:30,000
So then I need to go down this way.

1325
01:58:30,000 --> 01:58:33,000
No, smooth him over here.

1326
01:58:33,000 --> 01:58:41,000
Oh, that's so close, but it's not right.

1327
01:58:41,000 --> 01:58:44,000
It's so close.

1328
01:58:44,000 --> 01:58:48,000
One, two, three, four.

1329
01:58:48,000 --> 01:58:52,000
That's so close, but it's not right.

1330
01:58:52,000 --> 01:58:57,000
Nope, hold on.

1331
01:58:57,000 --> 01:59:01,000
Nope.

1332
01:59:01,000 --> 01:59:09,000
This needs to be that way.

1333
01:59:09,000 --> 01:59:27,000
Cannon joins the dark lines.

1334
01:59:27,000 --> 01:59:31,000
The cannon's definitely in the right spot.

1335
01:59:31,000 --> 01:59:45,000
I had it close before.

1336
01:59:45,000 --> 01:59:52,000
I got to move him back out of the way.

1337
01:59:52,000 --> 02:00:10,000
So it has to go to here to...

1338
02:00:10,000 --> 02:00:15,000
Laser should be in the right spot, right?

1339
02:00:15,000 --> 02:00:22,000
Because wouldn't it come down like this?

1340
02:00:22,000 --> 02:00:25,000
Put the laser here.

1341
02:00:25,000 --> 02:00:30,000
Because then it would be...

1342
02:00:30,000 --> 02:00:35,000
Oh.

1343
02:00:35,000 --> 02:00:39,000
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh.

1344
02:00:39,000 --> 02:00:41,000
It's just close.

1345
02:00:41,000 --> 02:00:55,000
So this is really close.

1346
02:00:55,000 --> 02:01:02,000
I'm just trying to think about it before I move anything.

1347
02:01:02,000 --> 02:01:05,000
These have to be swapped, right?

1348
02:01:05,000 --> 02:01:06,000
Hold on.

1349
02:01:06,000 --> 02:01:20,000
Nope, put him back.

1350
02:01:20,000 --> 02:01:27,000
One, two, three, four.

1351
02:01:27,000 --> 02:01:47,000
All right.

1352
02:01:47,000 --> 02:01:51,000
This is always going to come out like this, right?

1353
02:01:51,000 --> 02:01:53,000
See where it pops out from.

1354
02:01:53,000 --> 02:02:02,000
Bottom here.

1355
02:02:02,000 --> 02:02:05,000
No.

1356
02:02:05,000 --> 02:02:22,000
It's the way that it connects.

1357
02:02:22,000 --> 02:02:34,000
Okay, hold on.

1358
02:02:34,000 --> 02:02:36,000
Yeah, this kind of like has to go here, right?

1359
02:02:36,000 --> 02:02:38,000
That has to go there.

1360
02:02:38,000 --> 02:02:46,000
Because now I need it to come down and over.

1361
02:02:46,000 --> 02:02:49,000
Done.

1362
02:02:49,000 --> 02:02:54,000
Hold on, hold on, hold on, hold on, hold on.

1363
02:02:54,000 --> 02:02:56,000
Ah.

1364
02:02:56,000 --> 02:02:58,000
Shit.

1365
02:02:58,000 --> 02:03:07,000
Oh, it's so close.

1366
02:03:07,000 --> 02:03:24,000
It's close.

1367
02:03:24,000 --> 02:03:33,000
I'm looking at the symbol from this perspective.

1368
02:03:33,000 --> 02:03:42,000
I'm going to move this one over here for a second.

1369
02:03:42,000 --> 02:03:51,000
No, these can be moved over here, but that doesn't help me at all.

1370
02:03:51,000 --> 02:03:53,000
I'm going to put him back.

1371
02:03:53,000 --> 02:04:02,000
Everyone go back.

1372
02:04:02,000 --> 02:04:04,000
It needs to be a line here.

1373
02:04:04,000 --> 02:04:07,000
You need to switch.

1374
02:04:07,000 --> 02:04:11,000
I like it this kind of get down here.

1375
02:04:11,000 --> 02:04:19,000
You go down here and it's over.

1376
02:04:19,000 --> 02:04:21,000
I wonder if he can't be connected to something.

1377
02:04:21,000 --> 02:04:34,000
He has to go like a round.

1378
02:04:34,000 --> 02:04:36,000
He's down there now.

1379
02:04:36,000 --> 02:04:45,000
Hold on.

1380
02:04:45,000 --> 02:04:47,000
No, no, no.

1381
02:04:47,000 --> 02:04:52,000
Come back here.

1382
02:04:52,000 --> 02:05:07,000
Oh, it's just the connections that just confuse the hell out of me.

1383
02:05:07,000 --> 02:05:17,000
There.

1384
02:05:17,000 --> 02:05:32,000
Shit.

1385
02:05:32,000 --> 02:05:45,000
Okay, I need to go.

1386
02:05:45,000 --> 02:05:55,000
He needs to go down here.

1387
02:05:55,000 --> 02:06:02,000
Oh, shit.

1388
02:06:02,000 --> 02:06:16,000
Just for fun, I'm going to move the cannon around a little more.

1389
02:06:16,000 --> 02:06:28,000
I need to see it from like every angle.

1390
02:06:28,000 --> 02:06:30,000
Hold on.

1391
02:06:30,000 --> 02:06:36,000
Hold on a second.

1392
02:06:36,000 --> 02:06:45,000
He's almost down there.

1393
02:06:45,000 --> 02:06:58,000
Hold on.

1394
02:06:58,000 --> 02:07:01,000
It's just the wrong way.

1395
02:07:01,000 --> 02:07:04,000
It's just the wrong way.

1396
02:07:04,000 --> 02:07:07,000
One, two.

1397
02:07:07,000 --> 02:07:14,000
It's all twisted.

1398
02:07:14,000 --> 02:07:40,000
There needs to be a connection here.

1399
02:07:40,000 --> 02:07:43,000
But there's only two lines.

1400
02:07:43,000 --> 02:07:45,000
You know what I mean?

1401
02:07:45,000 --> 02:07:48,000
I'm trying to, because it has to be like this.

1402
02:07:48,000 --> 02:07:51,000
One, two, three, four.

1403
02:07:51,000 --> 02:07:53,000
Bang, bang, bang, bang, bang.

1404
02:07:53,000 --> 02:07:55,000
There's five pieces.

1405
02:07:55,000 --> 02:08:08,000
They only connect a certain way like this, like with diagonals.

1406
02:08:08,000 --> 02:08:18,000
And I had it the right way before.

1407
02:08:18,000 --> 02:08:38,000
What was my wish for last appointing a job?

1408
02:08:38,000 --> 02:08:45,000
I can start at Sunday at least seven weeks after I graduate.

1409
02:08:45,000 --> 02:08:55,000
I'm trying to get the cannon to go down there.

1410
02:09:15,000 --> 02:09:25,000
I'm trying to get the cannon to go down there.

1411
02:09:25,000 --> 02:09:33,000
I'm trying to get the cannon to go down there.

1412
02:09:33,000 --> 02:09:49,000
I don't know. This one's just like, I just keep getting confused.

1413
02:09:49,000 --> 02:10:03,000
I can't bring this guy back down.

1414
02:10:03,000 --> 02:10:13,000
I'm trying to get the cannon to go down there.

1415
02:10:13,000 --> 02:10:23,000
I'm trying to get the cannon to go down there.

1416
02:10:23,000 --> 02:10:37,000
I was so close before.

1417
02:10:37,000 --> 02:10:45,000
Hold on a second.

1418
02:10:45,000 --> 02:11:03,000
I'm trying to get the cannon to go down there.

1419
02:11:03,000 --> 02:11:09,000
I'm trying to get the cannon to go down there.

1420
02:11:09,000 --> 02:11:33,000
Hold on a minute.

1421
02:11:33,000 --> 02:11:43,000
Hold on a minute.

1422
02:11:43,000 --> 02:11:51,000
I need...oh, shit.

1423
02:11:51,000 --> 02:12:01,000
I'm trying to get the cannon to go down there.

1424
02:12:01,000 --> 02:12:09,000
I'm trying to get the cannon to go down there.

1425
02:12:09,000 --> 02:12:21,000
I just got to do some moving around.

1426
02:12:21,000 --> 02:12:31,000
He has to be there.

1427
02:12:31,000 --> 02:12:41,000
I'm trying to get the cannon to go down there.

1428
02:12:41,000 --> 02:12:49,000
I'm trying to get the cannon to go down there.

1429
02:12:49,000 --> 02:13:09,000
I'm trying to get the cannon to go down there.

1430
02:13:09,000 --> 02:13:19,000
I'm trying to get the cannon to go down there.

1431
02:13:19,000 --> 02:13:23,000
That's it.

1432
02:13:23,000 --> 02:13:27,000
That's it.

1433
02:13:27,000 --> 02:13:33,000
I did it, mom.

1434
02:13:33,000 --> 02:13:39,000
I did it.

1435
02:13:39,000 --> 02:13:47,000
Hey.

1436
02:13:47,000 --> 02:13:57,000
I'm trying to get the cannon to go down there.

1437
02:13:57,000 --> 02:14:05,000
I'm trying to get the cannon to go down there.

1438
02:14:05,000 --> 02:14:15,000
That was all I had to do.

1439
02:14:15,000 --> 02:14:21,000
Okay.

1440
02:14:21,000 --> 02:14:27,000
See what's in the next room.

1441
02:14:27,000 --> 02:14:29,000
Same thing except it's a way to block.

1442
02:14:29,000 --> 02:14:37,000
Let's just go all the way through and take a look at everything.

1443
02:14:37,000 --> 02:14:45,000
What the hell is wrong with this guy?

1444
02:14:45,000 --> 02:14:49,000
Can I get up there?

1445
02:14:49,000 --> 02:14:53,000
I guess I can't climb up that.

1446
02:14:53,000 --> 02:14:55,000
I know what I can do though.

1447
02:14:55,000 --> 02:15:05,000
Where's the dog?

1448
02:15:05,000 --> 02:15:15,000
Where the hell is the dog?

1449
02:15:15,000 --> 02:15:35,000
I don't know where the dog is.

1450
02:15:35,000 --> 02:15:39,000
Let me go.

1451
02:15:39,000 --> 02:15:45,000
You're just sitting on the button.

1452
02:15:45,000 --> 02:15:49,000
Get over here.

1453
02:15:49,000 --> 02:15:57,000
I forgot I had you sitting on that button.

1454
02:15:57,000 --> 02:15:59,000
Yeah, a big beak.

1455
02:15:59,000 --> 02:16:07,000
I've got a new button for you to step on.

1456
02:16:07,000 --> 02:16:09,000
Step on this one.

1457
02:16:09,000 --> 02:16:13,000
You're my button pressing dog.

1458
02:16:13,000 --> 02:16:17,000
Thanks, little buddy.

1459
02:16:17,000 --> 02:16:25,000
Did I screw myself here?

1460
02:16:25,000 --> 02:16:27,000
All right.

1461
02:16:27,000 --> 02:16:33,000
Kind of scared that I might have just accidentally screwed that whole thing up.

1462
02:16:33,000 --> 02:16:35,000
I can push this now.

1463
02:16:35,000 --> 02:16:37,000
Okay.

1464
02:16:37,000 --> 02:16:41,000
Go all the way back.

1465
02:16:41,000 --> 02:16:51,000
Him stepping on that drops the block.

1466
02:16:51,000 --> 02:16:55,000
I'm going to jump on this and then jump on him and then jump on his head.

1467
02:16:55,000 --> 02:17:05,000
I look at his face.

1468
02:17:05,000 --> 02:17:07,000
He's like, yes.

1469
02:17:07,000 --> 02:17:09,000
I'm helping.

1470
02:17:09,000 --> 02:17:11,000
He reminds me of little Otto.

1471
02:17:11,000 --> 02:17:21,000
Go on and keep pushing.

1472
02:17:21,000 --> 02:17:31,000
I'm going to jump on him.

1473
02:17:31,000 --> 02:17:37,000
I'm going to jump on him.

1474
02:17:37,000 --> 02:17:41,000
I'm going to jump on him.

1475
02:17:41,000 --> 02:17:51,000
I'm going to jump on him.

1476
02:17:51,000 --> 02:17:59,000
Okay.

1477
02:17:59,000 --> 02:18:03,000
Hold on.

1478
02:18:03,000 --> 02:18:19,000
You go ahead and stand on that, buddy.

1479
02:18:19,000 --> 02:18:25,000
There we go.

1480
02:18:25,000 --> 02:18:33,000
Let's see what's up here.

1481
02:18:33,000 --> 02:18:41,000
I don't know how they just stretched this out.

1482
02:18:41,000 --> 02:18:45,000
That's a little bug.

1483
02:18:45,000 --> 02:18:47,000
That's it.

1484
02:18:47,000 --> 02:18:49,000
A fly.

1485
02:18:49,000 --> 02:18:53,000
Save it.

1486
02:18:53,000 --> 02:19:01,000
Can that fly be put somewhere?

1487
02:19:01,000 --> 02:19:03,000
I think so.

1488
02:19:03,000 --> 02:19:07,000
Got a half-due.

1489
02:19:07,000 --> 02:19:11,000
Where was there a spot for a fly?

1490
02:19:11,000 --> 02:19:15,000
It was a by-question.

1491
02:19:15,000 --> 02:19:25,000
I can suck up something here too.

1492
02:19:25,000 --> 02:19:33,000
I'm going to remember that.

1493
02:19:33,000 --> 02:19:41,000
Can we fit in here?

1494
02:19:41,000 --> 02:19:47,000
No.

1495
02:19:47,000 --> 02:19:51,000
Can I put him in the dog bowl?

1496
02:19:51,000 --> 02:19:53,000
Oh no.

1497
02:19:53,000 --> 02:19:57,000
The baby's crying again.

1498
02:19:57,000 --> 02:20:03,000
Oh, shit.

1499
02:20:03,000 --> 02:20:05,000
Okay.

1500
02:20:05,000 --> 02:20:11,000
There we go.

1501
02:20:11,000 --> 02:20:13,000
Go on the right way.

1502
02:20:13,000 --> 02:20:23,000
That one's all screwed up.

1503
02:20:23,000 --> 02:20:31,000
I'm pretty sure this is right.

1504
02:20:31,000 --> 02:20:41,000
I'm going to have to push.

1505
02:20:41,000 --> 02:20:49,000
I'm going to listen.

1506
02:20:49,000 --> 02:21:03,000
I think that's right.

1507
02:21:03,000 --> 02:21:07,000
No.

1508
02:21:07,000 --> 02:21:11,000
This goes here.

1509
02:21:11,000 --> 02:21:17,000
There.

1510
02:21:17,000 --> 02:21:29,000
Did I swap this the wrong way?

1511
02:21:29,000 --> 02:21:35,000
I don't know.

1512
02:21:35,000 --> 02:21:49,000
I wish there was a speed up button.

1513
02:21:49,000 --> 02:21:59,000
I hope I didn't do this wrong.

1514
02:21:59,000 --> 02:22:05,000
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

1515
02:22:05,000 --> 02:22:09,000
Where's it going?

1516
02:22:09,000 --> 02:22:11,000
Okay.

1517
02:22:11,000 --> 02:22:21,000
I'm going to have to do this.

1518
02:22:21,000 --> 02:22:29,000
I see the worst part about this.

1519
02:22:29,000 --> 02:22:33,000
This is obviously a staple of this game.

1520
02:22:33,000 --> 02:22:39,000
I'm going to have to do this.

1521
02:22:39,000 --> 02:22:43,000
That is crystal number three.

1522
02:22:43,000 --> 02:22:47,000
I put the fly in here maybe?

1523
02:22:47,000 --> 02:22:51,000
What does that do?

1524
02:22:51,000 --> 02:22:55,000
He just like died.

1525
02:22:55,000 --> 02:22:59,000
Does he eat that?

1526
02:22:59,000 --> 02:23:03,000
It is a dog bowl, right?

1527
02:23:03,000 --> 02:23:09,000
Doesn't Big Big fly when he eats a fly?

1528
02:23:09,000 --> 02:23:13,000
Didn't that happen?

1529
02:23:13,000 --> 02:23:17,000
He ate it.

1530
02:23:17,000 --> 02:23:21,000
I can't get it back.

1531
02:23:21,000 --> 02:23:25,000
Do I fly out here?

1532
02:23:25,000 --> 02:23:41,000
Maybe I take him up to the area where I found the fly.

1533
02:23:41,000 --> 02:23:45,000
I got a pee again.

1534
02:23:45,000 --> 02:23:49,000
I'm drinking a bunch of coffee.

1535
02:23:49,000 --> 02:24:07,000
I'm going to have to go out and have a drink.

1536
02:24:07,000 --> 02:24:15,000
I know the way that thing was above the octopus.

1537
02:24:15,000 --> 02:24:17,000
I can't even come down.

1538
02:24:17,000 --> 02:24:27,000
He can't even walk up it.

1539
02:24:27,000 --> 02:24:37,000
I'm seeing it.

1540
02:24:37,000 --> 02:24:45,000
I love these rooms.

1541
02:24:45,000 --> 02:24:47,000
These are also interesting.

1542
02:24:47,000 --> 02:24:49,000
Interesting.

1543
02:24:49,000 --> 02:24:51,000
Let me guess.

1544
02:24:51,000 --> 02:24:57,000
I'm going to fly up there.

1545
02:24:57,000 --> 02:25:01,000
Come on.

1546
02:25:01,000 --> 02:25:03,000
Big, big.

1547
02:25:03,000 --> 02:25:13,000
What's going on here?

1548
02:25:13,000 --> 02:25:17,000
Big, big.

1549
02:25:17,000 --> 02:25:25,000
If you're real nice, if you could fly up there, buddy.

1550
02:25:25,000 --> 02:25:27,000
If you're really, really great.

1551
02:25:27,000 --> 02:25:33,000
If you could get up there, man.

1552
02:25:33,000 --> 02:25:45,000
How do I get in the fly?

1553
02:25:45,000 --> 02:25:57,000
Is there something I'm missing here?

1554
02:25:57,000 --> 02:26:07,000
Is he not ready to fly yet?

1555
02:26:07,000 --> 02:26:11,000
I don't think I can flatten the room.

1556
02:26:11,000 --> 02:26:13,000
There's nothing in here.

1557
02:26:13,000 --> 02:26:15,000
This is where the spinning wheel was.

1558
02:26:15,000 --> 02:26:17,000
Over here.

1559
02:26:17,000 --> 02:26:23,000
About this way.

1560
02:26:23,000 --> 02:26:33,000
I wish I had a m-

1561
02:26:33,000 --> 02:26:35,000
Because he ate it.

1562
02:26:35,000 --> 02:26:37,000
I can't get it back.

1563
02:26:37,000 --> 02:26:47,000
Let's go.

1564
02:26:47,000 --> 02:27:07,000
I can't go anywhere here.

1565
02:27:07,000 --> 02:27:15,000
There was like a place in the area.

1566
02:27:15,000 --> 02:27:17,000
Backtrack to the first room.

1567
02:27:17,000 --> 02:27:19,000
Oh, God.

1568
02:27:19,000 --> 02:27:23,000
That might be a thing.

1569
02:27:23,000 --> 02:27:31,000
Wasn't there something in this room that I missed?

1570
02:27:31,000 --> 02:27:39,000
I feel like there was something else that I didn't do over here.

1571
02:27:39,000 --> 02:27:41,000
Can you fly up there?

1572
02:27:41,000 --> 02:27:43,000
Can you go up there, big, big?

1573
02:27:43,000 --> 02:27:53,000
I can't go up there.

1574
02:27:53,000 --> 02:27:57,000
Huh.

1575
02:27:57,000 --> 02:28:01,000
Huh.

1576
02:28:01,000 --> 02:28:09,000
So, this seems to be a little bit of a problem.

1577
02:28:09,000 --> 02:28:19,000
There are no more flies to feed him.

1578
02:28:19,000 --> 02:28:29,000
There's a button right here, though.

1579
02:28:29,000 --> 02:28:33,000
I feel like I need to move this out of the way.

1580
02:28:33,000 --> 02:28:37,000
But I can't.

1581
02:28:37,000 --> 02:28:47,000
There's a big red button here, but I can't move this guy.

1582
02:28:47,000 --> 02:28:57,000
Backtrack.

1583
02:28:57,000 --> 02:29:01,000
Backtrack time.

1584
02:29:01,000 --> 02:29:25,000
What?

1585
02:29:25,000 --> 02:29:35,000
He already ate this.

1586
02:29:35,000 --> 02:29:41,000
Oh, my God.

1587
02:29:41,000 --> 02:29:43,000
What?

1588
02:29:43,000 --> 02:29:45,000
What the hell?

1589
02:29:45,000 --> 02:29:47,000
What?

1590
02:29:47,000 --> 02:29:49,000
You have to do it in the same room.

1591
02:29:49,000 --> 02:29:51,000
Okay, well, let's talk.

1592
02:29:51,000 --> 02:29:55,000
Let's see another cutscene with a bunch of Jebarras.

1593
02:29:55,000 --> 02:29:59,000
In Rotavoko, on another day, I said it to E.A.K.A.

1594
02:29:59,000 --> 02:30:01,000
I'll ask you a sneak or an impulse.

1595
02:30:01,000 --> 02:30:03,000
Rush in a red.

1596
02:30:03,000 --> 02:30:07,000
It's in Sanatura.

1597
02:30:07,000 --> 02:30:11,000
The red or the other chronic does seem like Nuku.

1598
02:30:11,000 --> 02:30:13,000
I said feed.

1599
02:30:13,000 --> 02:30:15,000
I already did that, though.

1600
02:30:15,000 --> 02:30:17,000
I think I'll have to do a quick.

1601
02:30:17,000 --> 02:30:27,000
I think I'll have to do a quick.

1602
02:30:27,000 --> 02:30:35,000
I think I'll have to do a quick.

1603
02:30:35,000 --> 02:30:39,000
I think I'll have to do a quick.

1604
02:30:39,000 --> 02:30:43,000
I think I'll have to do a quick.

1605
02:30:43,000 --> 02:31:07,000
Okay.

1606
02:31:07,000 --> 02:31:09,000
Okay.

1607
02:31:09,000 --> 02:31:11,000
Cool.

1608
02:31:11,000 --> 02:31:13,000
Eat it.

1609
02:31:13,000 --> 02:31:17,000
Eat it.

1610
02:31:17,000 --> 02:31:21,000
Eat the...

1611
02:31:21,000 --> 02:31:23,000
Thank you.

1612
02:31:23,000 --> 02:31:25,000
What's going here?

1613
02:31:25,000 --> 02:31:31,000
This is going to take me, uh, not entirely sure.

1614
02:31:31,000 --> 02:31:33,000
Is it a lever for the sewer?

1615
02:31:33,000 --> 02:31:39,000
He sure can fit a lot of things in his stomach.

1616
02:31:39,000 --> 02:31:43,000
You're the song that I'm trying to make.

1617
02:31:43,000 --> 02:31:45,000
It's the song that you're making.

1618
02:31:45,000 --> 02:31:49,000
It's the song that you're making.

1619
02:31:49,000 --> 02:31:53,000
I just said my name.

1620
02:31:53,000 --> 02:32:01,000
I just said my fucking name.

1621
02:32:01,000 --> 02:32:05,000
Oh, he's kidding me.

1622
02:32:05,000 --> 02:32:09,000
That's so cool.

1623
02:32:09,000 --> 02:32:15,000
That was just German 985.

1624
02:32:15,000 --> 02:32:19,000
I think this is showing some of the backers.

1625
02:32:19,000 --> 02:32:21,000
I better write that down.

1626
02:32:21,000 --> 02:32:29,000
I better write that down.

1627
02:32:29,000 --> 02:32:31,000
Okay.

1628
02:32:31,000 --> 02:32:33,000
That's cool.

1629
02:32:33,000 --> 02:32:35,000
I got to see my...

1630
02:32:35,000 --> 02:32:37,000
I got to write all these names now.

1631
02:32:37,000 --> 02:32:39,000
Yeah.

1632
02:32:39,000 --> 02:32:45,000
This is probably one of the Kickstarter, like credit roll things.

1633
02:32:45,000 --> 02:32:47,000
That was very surprising.

1634
02:32:47,000 --> 02:32:53,000
I did not expect to go into this room and then see my name on the screen.

1635
02:32:53,000 --> 02:32:55,000
Oh, this is not the end of the game by any means.

1636
02:32:55,000 --> 02:32:57,000
Let's think about this.

1637
02:32:57,000 --> 02:32:59,000
Is this actually doing this room?

1638
02:32:59,000 --> 02:33:03,000
Or is this like a bonus Kickstarter room?

1639
02:33:03,000 --> 02:33:05,000
There it was again.

1640
02:33:05,000 --> 02:33:09,000
All right, well, I guess let's...

1641
02:33:09,000 --> 02:33:11,000
Let's leave.

1642
02:33:11,000 --> 02:33:15,000
Well, we found the...

1643
02:33:15,000 --> 02:33:17,000
Found that.

1644
02:33:17,000 --> 02:33:23,000
I have a few things to give my friend down here.

1645
02:33:23,000 --> 02:33:29,000
Oh, shit.

1646
02:33:29,000 --> 02:33:33,000
Oh, there, there.

1647
02:33:33,000 --> 02:33:35,000
Is this one running out?

1648
02:33:35,000 --> 02:33:41,000
No, that's the one running out.

1649
02:33:41,000 --> 02:33:45,000
Can't remember, oh no, oh, no!

1650
02:33:45,000 --> 02:33:49,000
No one's crypto dormitles this room.

1651
02:33:49,000 --> 02:33:51,000
Only one left.

1652
02:33:51,000 --> 02:33:53,000
special

1653
02:33:53,000 --> 02:33:55,000
I

1654
02:33:55,000 --> 02:33:58,000
like it out of the

1655
02:33:58,000 --> 02:34:01,000
oh god i can skip it

1656
02:34:11,000 --> 02:34:13,000
hey give me that stuff you just got

1657
02:34:13,000 --> 02:34:23,000
i can't even tell what that was

1658
02:34:23,000 --> 02:34:33,000
that's the lever for downstairs and then that's also the thing to turn the power on i don't know what i should do first but i do know actually i do know what i should do first

1659
02:34:33,000 --> 02:34:37,000

1660
02:34:37,000 --> 02:34:44,000

1664
02:36:07,000 --> 02:36:09,000
you

1665
02:36:37,000 --> 02:36:39,000
you

1666
02:36:39,000 --> 02:36:45,000
right it down it could be a clue yeah this this could be a clue

1667
02:36:45,000 --> 02:36:55,000
all right i just peed and forgot the entire game what was happening

1668
02:36:55,000 --> 02:36:57,000
what was happening

1669
02:37:05,000 --> 02:37:09,000
i got the piece i got a couple pieces let's go down let's go down first

1670
02:37:09,000 --> 02:37:13,000
down

1671
02:37:13,000 --> 02:37:23,000
this is not the lever for right here

1672
02:37:23,000 --> 02:37:33,000
dead all right call me stupid i really thought that was gonna be it

1673
02:37:33,000 --> 02:37:39,000
okay well let's go put the bug in the machine

1674
02:37:43,000 --> 02:37:53,000
and don't

1675
02:37:53,000 --> 02:37:59,000
know whoops

1676
02:37:59,000 --> 02:38:03,000
who was the power button yellow room over here

1677
02:38:03,000 --> 02:38:13,000
there it is except it's currently functioning now it is

1678
02:38:13,000 --> 02:38:21,000
okay well let me go out back again

1679
02:38:23,000 --> 02:38:27,000
this should be functioning

1680
02:38:27,000 --> 02:38:29,000
it is functioning

1681
02:38:33,000 --> 02:38:37,000
so now does that allow me to use the

1682
02:38:37,000 --> 02:38:39,000
shick downstairs

1683
02:38:45,000 --> 02:38:51,000
i can press this button no is that open the door i hope so please open the door

1684
02:38:57,000 --> 02:39:01,000
well i press the button i can press it

1685
02:39:05,000 --> 02:39:09,000
big big it's time for you to take another trip

1686
02:39:21,000 --> 02:39:23,000
why

1687
02:39:27,000 --> 02:39:35,000
a couple different ways to go here i just saw that up here let's go here first

1688
02:39:37,000 --> 02:39:43,000
this is gonna be confusing oh boy

1689
02:39:43,000 --> 02:39:47,000
oh shit i accidentally clicked out of the window

1690
02:39:47,000 --> 02:39:49,000
i always do that

1691
02:39:49,000 --> 02:39:57,000
i wish me luck as i have no idea where the hell i'm going

1692
02:39:57,000 --> 02:40:01,000
i found a button

1693
02:40:01,000 --> 02:40:17,000
that sounds like suction

1694
02:40:21,000 --> 02:40:25,000
okay so there's one of two things that are gonna happen here

1695
02:40:25,000 --> 02:40:33,000
i suck up the cheese guy from the pipe that's in that room

1696
02:40:33,000 --> 02:40:41,000
i can push that block back and it sucks up and it's probably gonna go back to that other room

1697
02:40:41,000 --> 02:40:45,000
let's go down here

1698
02:40:45,000 --> 02:40:53,000
it's not a lever

1699
02:40:59,000 --> 02:41:03,000
go on go down there

1700
02:41:07,000 --> 02:41:11,000
let me just make sure i didn't miss anything that's all i could do up there right

1701
02:41:11,000 --> 02:41:15,000
let's go left just to make sure i didn't miss anything

1702
02:41:15,000 --> 02:41:21,000
no i didn't because this takes you all the way around right

1703
02:41:21,000 --> 02:41:27,000
just to be clear i'm just gonna look up here and make sure yes okay let's leave

1704
02:41:33,000 --> 02:41:39,000
he's flapping odd he's flapping so hard that's if he stopped doing what he was doing he was gonna hit the ground like brick

1705
02:41:39,000 --> 02:41:45,000
that's a lot better all right i'm gonna move the cheese cheetos block

1706
02:41:45,000 --> 02:41:51,000
now i can open the other door let's just see what's in that other room cars before i do anything else

1707
02:41:53,000 --> 02:41:57,000
thank you very much

1708
02:42:01,000 --> 02:42:05,000
has to go right here right

1709
02:42:05,000 --> 02:42:09,000
let's go

1710
02:42:13,000 --> 02:42:15,000
well there's the other lever

1711
02:42:15,000 --> 02:42:17,000
no fuck

1712
02:42:19,000 --> 02:42:21,000
didn't want to do that

1713
02:42:23,000 --> 02:42:27,000
well i did it so let's just see what's over here

1714
02:42:35,000 --> 02:42:43,000
i can't go that way

1715
02:42:49,000 --> 02:42:55,000
we can keep going look at this look at how crazy this is

1716
02:42:55,000 --> 02:42:59,000
what is that say of 5% 5 over 50 right at time

1717
02:42:59,000 --> 02:43:09,000
5% 50 is that 5% 50 or is that 5% what the hell is that symbol

1718
02:43:09,000 --> 02:43:15,000
50 50

1719
02:43:15,000 --> 02:43:19,000
whatever

1720
02:43:19,000 --> 02:43:29,000
the zero that zero is really small

1721
02:43:49,000 --> 02:43:59,000
damn okay this is gonna take a minute

1722
02:43:59,000 --> 02:44:13,000
let's see how much that moves and then i can determine how many more times i have to do it

1723
02:44:13,000 --> 02:44:21,000
move one more but i still can't go over there maybe this one moves that

1724
02:44:23,000 --> 02:44:31,000
i'm gonna yeah i'm gonna assume doing that is gonna move this so let's go and move the second one once more

1725
02:44:43,000 --> 02:44:51,000
yeah

1726
02:44:53,000 --> 02:44:55,000
thanks

1727
02:44:59,000 --> 02:45:01,000
wait a second

1728
02:45:03,000 --> 02:45:07,000
was that not moving that other one this this one here

1729
02:45:07,000 --> 02:45:13,000
right that should be moving which one isn't moving

1730
02:45:15,000 --> 02:45:19,000
it's moving the green one

1731
02:45:21,000 --> 02:45:23,000
one more

1732
02:45:27,000 --> 02:45:35,000
one more or two more one more then i have to bring this one all the way around again so that's one two so one over here and then two over there

1733
02:45:37,000 --> 02:45:45,000
one then one two

1734
02:45:51,000 --> 02:45:59,000
do i reach out at all of course i do but i am trying to focus on the game because this requires a fuck i did it too many times

1735
02:45:59,000 --> 02:46:09,000
the game like this where you have to like remember a lot of things and focus on like a puzzle it's hard to

1736
02:46:09,000 --> 02:46:11,000
i need to focus

1737
02:46:11,000 --> 02:46:13,000
i need to focus

1738
02:46:13,000 --> 02:46:15,000
i need to focus

1739
02:46:15,000 --> 02:46:25,000
but can i only do it once per screen or something no let's go

1740
02:46:31,000 --> 02:46:39,000

1745
02:47:05,000 --> 02:47:13,000
you know what i mean like this is it in the order they do this or the colors

1746
02:47:13,000 --> 02:47:21,000

1747
02:47:21,000 --> 02:47:33,000
well it's three pinks and two grades

1748
02:47:39,000 --> 02:47:45,000
maybe when you looked out the window yeah they were

1749
02:47:45,000 --> 02:47:53,000
well i'm just going to pink gray pink pink

1750
02:47:53,000 --> 02:47:55,000
pink gray pink

1751
02:47:55,000 --> 02:48:01,000
gray just i don't i feel like they're going to need to it's probably the order they're chirping too

1752
02:48:01,000 --> 02:48:07,000
one pink gray gray

1753
02:48:07,000 --> 02:48:09,000
okay

1754
02:48:15,000 --> 02:48:25,000

1755
02:48:25,000 --> 02:48:33,000
you're out here but thanks a lot thanks for coming take it easy to you

1756
02:48:33,000 --> 02:48:39,000
whole another room whole another area

1757
02:48:39,000 --> 02:48:47,000
this one has a gigantic scratch on it looks like someone tried to break in

1758
02:48:47,000 --> 02:48:51,000
another one of these oh shit

1759
02:48:51,000 --> 02:48:59,000
this is this is not fair that's not fair at all

1760
02:49:01,000 --> 02:49:07,000
which one goes on the bottom let's just i need to look at the bottom first

1761
02:49:07,000 --> 02:49:15,000
so it's a swirl this one right it's the only one that exists

1762
02:49:17,000 --> 02:49:25,000
holy shit this is going to be difficult because i need to know exactly which one

1763
02:49:25,000 --> 02:49:33,000
so that's that so it comes up and around the left

1764
02:49:33,000 --> 02:49:41,000
so that one or that oh my god it could be any where could be land in one of these

1765
02:49:41,000 --> 02:49:45,000
i think it's this one right

1766
02:49:45,000 --> 02:49:49,000
you look at it the way it's supposed to be looked at

1767
02:49:49,000 --> 02:49:57,000
comes up around her left her right thigh

1768
02:49:59,000 --> 02:50:01,000
is it that one

1769
02:50:05,000 --> 02:50:09,000
first that's obviously the top piece

1770
02:50:09,000 --> 02:50:17,000
that one it got has a little bit of a bump to it though

1771
02:50:17,000 --> 02:50:25,000
could be that one well let me just let me get some of these out

1772
02:50:25,000 --> 02:50:31,000
I need to get obviously the bottom one out so i can't bring more than one they're

1773
02:50:31,000 --> 02:50:39,000
different colored ones maybe it's the ones that are colored differently

1774
02:51:01,000 --> 02:51:09,000
so

1775
02:51:09,000 --> 02:51:17,000
at least i have to go down

1776
02:51:17,000 --> 02:51:21,000
am i turning my head sideways

1777
02:51:21,000 --> 02:51:25,000
this is the list this one right let's take a look

1778
02:51:25,000 --> 02:51:29,000
oh yeah definitely definitely that one

1779
02:51:29,000 --> 02:51:33,000
i just want to make sure it was out

1780
02:51:45,000 --> 02:51:49,000
it's turning my head from side to side

1781
02:51:55,000 --> 02:51:59,000
if

1782
02:52:19,000 --> 02:52:23,000
these are the cem hundred

1783
02:52:23,000 --> 02:52:47,000
No, I'm going to be doing it backwards.

1784
02:52:47,000 --> 02:52:48,000
This needs to be right.

1785
02:52:48,000 --> 02:52:50,000
That one has to switch with this one.

1786
02:52:50,000 --> 02:52:53,000
We're ready to come out.

1787
02:52:53,000 --> 02:53:17,000
Come on out, all you.

1788
02:53:17,000 --> 02:53:24,000
That one's next, right?

1789
02:53:47,000 --> 02:53:54,000
Go that way.

1790
02:53:54,000 --> 02:54:00,000
Get out of my way, block.

1791
02:54:00,000 --> 02:54:01,000
Is that the one?

1792
02:54:01,000 --> 02:54:05,000
That is the one.

1793
02:54:05,000 --> 02:54:06,000
Open the door.

1794
02:54:06,000 --> 02:54:10,000
Oh, I got it, I got it.

1795
02:54:10,000 --> 02:54:12,000
I just, I just want to chill out.

1796
02:54:12,000 --> 02:54:13,000
Hang on a second.

1797
02:54:13,000 --> 02:54:15,000
I'm just calm down.

1798
02:54:15,000 --> 02:54:16,000
I got it.

1799
02:54:16,000 --> 02:54:17,000
Is that all right?

1800
02:54:17,000 --> 02:54:24,000
Don't worry about it.

1801
02:54:24,000 --> 02:54:34,000
Okay, I'm in another area with another pump.

1802
02:54:34,000 --> 02:54:37,000
I feel like the pumps matter, the colors of the pumps.

1803
02:54:37,000 --> 02:54:38,000
Because this is a blue one.

1804
02:54:38,000 --> 02:54:56,000
Time before this was purple, then before it was red, right?

1805
02:54:56,000 --> 02:54:58,000
This is a really cool looking run, by the way.

1806
02:54:58,000 --> 02:55:02,000
Anything to tell me, Mr.

1807
02:55:02,000 --> 02:55:09,000
I'm going to use that.

1808
02:55:09,000 --> 02:55:15,000
Perhaps the answer is daring right back at you.

1809
02:55:15,000 --> 02:55:20,000
Outside solutions, huh?

1810
02:55:20,000 --> 02:55:25,000
Beware the intruder, he claims to share your goals, yet seeks to destroy what you protect.

1811
02:55:25,000 --> 02:55:27,000
Okay.

1812
02:55:27,000 --> 02:55:31,000
A generous meal can often weigh heavily in your favor.

1813
02:55:33,000 --> 02:55:34,000
Let's go.

1814
02:55:40,000 --> 02:55:42,000
Come on, Big, Big.

1815
02:55:44,000 --> 02:55:48,000
So there's a monster in here, apparently, where somebody else is in here.

1816
02:55:48,000 --> 02:55:51,000
Now they're octopus to tell us more of a story.

1817
02:55:52,000 --> 02:55:55,000
Eggs?

1818
02:55:55,000 --> 02:55:57,000
You can't go wrong with eggs.

1819
02:55:57,000 --> 02:55:59,000
Just keep going.

1820
02:56:02,000 --> 02:56:05,000
We're gonna get to see another president. There's gonna be another president ant in here.

1821
02:56:05,000 --> 02:56:06,000
Hope you guys are ready.

1822
02:56:09,000 --> 02:56:10,000
Mully!

1823
02:56:10,000 --> 02:56:11,000
Yeah, ha, ha!

1824
02:56:13,000 --> 02:56:14,000
What?

1825
02:56:14,000 --> 02:56:16,000
That's all you got, bruise, bruise, bruise, and veils?

1826
02:56:16,000 --> 02:56:17,000
Mully!

1827
02:56:17,000 --> 02:56:18,000
Yeah, ha, ha!

1828
02:56:22,000 --> 02:56:24,000
Bully!

1829
02:56:26,000 --> 02:56:29,000
So that's all I'm gonna get from him is Bully.

1830
02:56:37,000 --> 02:56:40,000
Pink, gray, pink, pink, gray.

1831
02:56:40,000 --> 02:56:43,000
I'm just making sure I, cause it's showing me these this again.

1832
02:56:45,000 --> 02:56:47,000
Big, big, big, can fly.

1833
02:56:48,000 --> 02:56:52,000
Pot, we're not gonna do that yet. I'm gonna look, see what this is on the wall.

1834
02:57:07,000 --> 02:57:10,000
Okay, so you have to make one of the robot.

1835
02:57:11,000 --> 02:57:16,000
Well, let's simply look at what they look like.

1836
02:57:19,000 --> 02:57:21,000
Let's try this one.

1837
02:57:21,000 --> 02:57:24,000
This one has the thing in the top left.

1838
02:57:35,000 --> 02:57:37,000
Guess I can't make that one.

1839
02:57:37,000 --> 02:57:38,000
What about this one?

1840
02:57:39,000 --> 02:57:41,000
Top left, bottom right.

1841
02:57:42,000 --> 02:57:44,000
That's the right one, isn't it?

1842
02:57:46,000 --> 02:57:47,000
What about the middle?

1843
02:57:47,000 --> 02:57:49,000
Three on this and then that.

1844
02:57:53,000 --> 02:57:54,000
Wait, hold on, no.

1845
02:57:54,000 --> 02:57:56,000
This one didn't have that right.

1846
02:57:56,000 --> 02:57:57,000
Here we go.

1847
02:57:57,000 --> 02:57:59,000
He's gonna always get a claw for a hand.

1848
02:58:03,000 --> 02:58:04,000
Yep.

1849
02:58:04,000 --> 02:58:06,000
The body is that.

1850
02:58:07,000 --> 02:58:10,000
Triangle with this, where on the right?

1851
02:58:10,000 --> 02:58:12,000
I think that's the right one, right?

1852
02:58:14,000 --> 02:58:16,000
Yeah, that's the right one.

1853
02:58:16,000 --> 02:58:19,000
And then the head is the knife sticking out of his neck.

1854
02:58:19,000 --> 02:58:21,000
And the pretzel on the left, okay.

1855
02:58:27,000 --> 02:58:29,000
No, there's no hole on the right.

1856
02:58:32,000 --> 02:58:33,000
Like that.

1857
02:58:33,000 --> 02:58:34,000
Okay, let's try this one.

1858
02:58:36,000 --> 02:58:37,000
Nope.

1859
02:58:46,000 --> 02:58:48,000
The side is the saw.

1860
02:58:52,000 --> 02:58:53,000
Oh, that's right.

1861
02:58:57,000 --> 02:58:59,000
Is the bottom one wrong?

1862
02:59:01,000 --> 02:59:03,000
Oh, the bottom one has the three.

1863
02:59:03,000 --> 02:59:04,000
Yeah, this one is wrong.

1864
02:59:05,000 --> 02:59:06,000
Is this one?

1865
02:59:21,000 --> 02:59:23,000
One, two, two.

1866
02:59:23,000 --> 02:59:26,000
Unless it's another right.

1867
02:59:26,000 --> 02:59:27,000
No, it is.

1868
02:59:28,000 --> 02:59:30,000
Right one's more curvy.

1869
02:59:36,000 --> 02:59:39,000
Let's just take a look through this one.

1870
02:59:42,000 --> 02:59:44,000
Oh, is it a fist?

1871
02:59:44,000 --> 02:59:45,000
No, it's like the glove.

1872
02:59:45,000 --> 02:59:46,000
Yeah, it's that.

1873
02:59:48,000 --> 02:59:49,000
No, it's not that one.

1874
02:59:49,000 --> 02:59:51,000
Okay, so it is not this robot.

1875
02:59:51,000 --> 02:59:53,000
Is that one way over?

1876
02:59:58,000 --> 03:00:00,000
More about?

1877
03:00:02,000 --> 03:00:04,000
So we just did this one.

1878
03:00:11,000 --> 03:00:12,000
No, it didn't.

1879
03:00:16,000 --> 03:00:18,000
There's one line on his chest.

1880
03:00:22,000 --> 03:00:23,000
Yeah, it's the one.

1881
03:00:28,000 --> 03:00:30,000
Is the head correct?

1882
03:00:30,000 --> 03:00:33,000
Is the head of a head does?

1883
03:00:35,000 --> 03:00:37,000
So that's the head is correct.

1884
03:00:37,000 --> 03:00:42,000
The upper body has the line, the circle here, and then it's filled.

1885
03:00:44,000 --> 03:00:46,000
Line, circle here, and it's filled.

1886
03:00:47,000 --> 03:00:48,000
Yeah, that's right.

1887
03:00:58,000 --> 03:00:59,000
That's right.

1888
03:00:59,000 --> 03:01:01,000
One line, one line.

1889
03:01:04,000 --> 03:01:06,000
One line, one line, just make sure.

1890
03:01:08,000 --> 03:01:09,000
Hold on.

1891
03:01:09,000 --> 03:01:10,000
Here it is.

1892
03:01:12,000 --> 03:01:14,000
Drop the egg please.

1893
03:01:16,000 --> 03:01:18,000
Hey, it landed.

1894
03:01:23,000 --> 03:01:24,000
Oh!

1895
03:01:27,000 --> 03:01:28,000
Okay.

1896
03:01:33,000 --> 03:01:38,000
You know, it's good that I picked to do this one, because otherwise I would have been here a long time, huh?

1897
03:01:38,000 --> 03:01:40,000
This is the correct one.

1898
03:01:40,000 --> 03:01:42,000
If I started, like, I also start over here.

1899
03:01:44,000 --> 03:01:46,000
I would have been here a while.

1900
03:01:50,000 --> 03:01:51,000
Yeah!

1901
03:01:53,000 --> 03:01:55,000
Now, why should he be able to eat this?

1902
03:01:58,000 --> 03:02:00,000
Should he fly out there?

1903
03:02:00,000 --> 03:02:04,000
I mean, he can go in here, but I guess he's gonna go in there.

1904
03:02:17,000 --> 03:02:18,000
Octopus.

1905
03:02:19,000 --> 03:02:21,000
Hey, look at that.

1906
03:02:21,000 --> 03:02:23,000
Time for an octopus story, guys.

1907
03:02:23,000 --> 03:02:24,000
I can't wait.

1908
03:02:25,000 --> 03:02:26,000
That's a reverse.

1909
03:02:26,000 --> 03:02:27,000
That's a reverse.

1910
03:02:27,000 --> 03:02:29,000
I'll cut a rocket in my racing.

1911
03:02:29,000 --> 03:02:31,000
That's what the arena makes.

1912
03:02:31,000 --> 03:02:33,000
For the market, the arena goes down.

1913
03:02:33,000 --> 03:02:34,000
That's the ultra.

1914
03:02:34,000 --> 03:02:36,000
The concept may be a structure that's okay.

Amy Gaesha from comment arena.

03:03:41,000 --> 03:03:42,000
I amunto there and it is not the same thing as what words tree are kans along with the

1959
03:03:42,000 --> 03:03:43,000
Russian Shanse language stop.

1960
03:03:43,000 --> 03:03:43,000
Such As I was so bleak that sometimes the harsh words means시는 words dictate our

1961
03:03:43,000 --> 03:03:44,000
mind.

1962
03:03:44,000 --> 03:03:45,000
This game is pure disruptive and not necessary甜light.

1963
03:03:45,000 --> 03:03:46,000
Everything we need to learn is, Germany very much access to both areas.

1964
03:03:46,000 --> 03:03:48,000
In the last few script, we've met many questions Regierung and actions, from our

1965
03:03:48,000 --> 03:03:50,000
That'd be funny

1966
03:03:53,000 --> 03:03:57,000
This one is I don't know what color this octopus was but

1967
03:03:59,000 --> 03:04:04,000
But we'll color with the octopus as lips because to see the simple above his head

1968
03:04:06,000 --> 03:04:08,000
That's a symbol that we need to write down

1969
03:04:09,000 --> 03:04:21,000
What would you do if someone gave you a million dollar donation on stream? I would immediately refund it

1970
03:04:25,000 --> 03:04:28,000
That's like a sclery amount of money

1971
03:04:32,000 --> 03:04:34,000

03:04:39,000 --> 03:04:44,000

Now is theater Roosevelt gonna tell me something

1978
03:05:14,000 --> 03:05:16,000
Nope, he's still gonna say bully

1979
03:05:25,000 --> 03:05:27,000
Oh shit

1980
03:05:28,000 --> 03:05:30,000

1981
03:05:30,000 --> 03:05:32,000
Oh, no

1982
03:05:38,000 --> 03:05:41,000
Tell me to remember this it was I really should have written it down

1983
03:05:43,000 --> 03:05:45,000
You know what I mean like I should have written down the pattern because I have to do like the whole thing

1984
03:05:51,000 --> 03:05:53,000
No, it was this was here

1985
03:05:54,000 --> 03:05:57,000
This was maybe the hell is this fuzzy son of a bitch

1986
03:06:05,000 --> 03:06:11,000
I don't know I don't like no, I don't remember I thought that this was this is kind of closed

1987
03:06:15,000 --> 03:06:17,000

1988
03:06:19,000 --> 03:06:22,000
Oh shit, I think that's right

1989
03:06:24,000 --> 03:06:26,000
I

1990
03:06:26,000 --> 03:06:29,000
When I get this right I'm writing this whole thing down because I'm gonna have to do the whole thing probably eventually

1991
03:06:40,000 --> 03:06:42,000
Every watch the broadcast

1992
03:06:53,000 --> 03:06:55,000

1994
03:07:10,000 --> 03:07:13,000
Okay, got it I want to write this down

It's okay

2000
03:07:37,000 --> 03:07:39,000
P

2001
03:07:49,000 --> 03:07:51,000
Still the baby

2002
03:07:51,000 --> 03:07:54,000
We're gonna do now we're going to get pee back

2003
03:07:59,000 --> 03:08:05,000
All right, I'm kind of glad that I don't have the baby anymore because it means I don't have to do the song thing anymore

2004
03:08:10,000 --> 03:08:14,000
All right, what we doing something before the other guy takes stole my baby

Please plug it into the device

2008
03:08:31,000 --> 03:08:34,000
Power button was back here I believe I remember correctly

2009
03:08:44,000 --> 03:08:49,000
This is the neverhood

2010
03:08:50,000 --> 03:08:52,000
Spiritual successor

2011
03:08:54,000 --> 03:09:00,000
This is not a sequel to the never same style same people that worked on it, but not a direct sequel

2012
03:09:03,000 --> 03:09:05,000
All right, do you have anything new to tell me now?

2013
03:09:15,000 --> 03:09:17,000
Oh

2014
03:09:20,000 --> 03:09:22,000
Let's go upstairs or downstairs

2015
03:09:36,000 --> 03:09:38,000
Oh

2016
03:09:45,000 --> 03:09:47,000
I

2017
03:09:47,000 --> 03:09:50,000
Purple face i'm not sure it matters

2018
03:09:54,000 --> 03:09:56,000
But you know it might

2019
03:10:02,000 --> 03:10:04,000
Don't get any day miss anything here

2020
03:10:05,000 --> 03:10:07,000
Well now I can go across because the uh

2021
03:10:09,000 --> 03:10:11,000
I did the egg things and I can go this way

2022
03:10:15,000 --> 03:10:17,000
One of these is definitely bill from the neverhood by the way

2023
03:10:18,000 --> 03:10:20,000
Me too

2024
03:10:25,000 --> 03:10:27,000
Right it down

2025
03:10:38,000 --> 03:10:40,000
Nice plus

2026
03:10:41,000 --> 03:10:43,000
You

2027
03:10:49,000 --> 03:10:51,000
Square

2028
03:10:54,000 --> 03:10:56,000
And what about your odd symbols

2029
03:11:03,000 --> 03:11:07,000
With the box within a box or now more like a

2030
03:11:11,000 --> 03:11:13,000
Two lines

2031
03:11:16,000 --> 03:11:18,000
Done

2032
03:11:32,000 --> 03:11:34,000
Okay

2033
03:11:35,000 --> 03:11:40,000
Um try this down to right

2034
03:11:48,000 --> 03:11:51,000
Shit more symbols

2035
03:12:04,000 --> 03:12:06,000
Oh

2036
03:12:12,000 --> 03:12:14,000
Oh

2037
03:12:14,000 --> 03:12:17,000
Hey, there's the music kicking in for me. Thanks music

2038
03:12:27,000 --> 03:12:31,000
I want to go back for a second because I think one of these wasn't filled in over here

2039
03:12:34,000 --> 03:12:37,000
It's more fun to write it down though. Oh, okay, click out

2040
03:12:45,000 --> 03:12:47,000
That way okay, make sure I remember that

2041
03:12:50,000 --> 03:12:52,000
I like I like keeping a notebook. It's fun

2042
03:12:53,000 --> 03:12:55,000
I could like take a picture with my iPhone, but then I thought about it. I was like you know

2043
03:12:55,000 --> 03:12:58,000
I want to like write it down. I want to keep my like like detective notebook bed

2044
03:13:04,000 --> 03:13:06,000
Okay, no, we teleported

2045
03:13:15,000 --> 03:13:17,000
That's the solution

2046
03:13:17,000 --> 03:13:22,000
Like I told you that was such a good lucky guest to do that one first because if you came over here first

2047
03:13:22,000 --> 03:13:24,000
You would have seen that that was the correct one

2048
03:13:24,000 --> 03:13:27,000
Now we have another one of these oh boy

2049
03:13:35,000 --> 03:13:38,000
I'm not even sure there's a way to tell

2050
03:13:40,000 --> 03:13:42,000
Let's move all this out of the way to see

2051
03:13:47,000 --> 03:13:49,000
Is it baby

2052
03:13:53,000 --> 03:13:55,000
What did he scratch there was something scratched off

2053
03:13:56,000 --> 03:13:58,000
I

2054
03:14:02,000 --> 03:14:05,000
Didn't he scratch off the part of the door maybe it's there on the door

2055
03:14:07,000 --> 03:14:10,000
So I'll check behind all these make sure it's not listed here somewhere

2056
03:14:13,000 --> 03:14:15,000
And that's not behind this

2057
03:14:15,000 --> 03:14:17,000
Oh

2058
03:14:23,000 --> 03:14:25,000
No

2059
03:14:25,000 --> 03:14:27,000
Well, it's somewhere

2060
03:14:29,000 --> 03:14:35,000
It's definitely the guy holding or it's definitely the guy that took the baby, but I mean there's a bunch of different faces here

2061
03:14:35,000 --> 03:14:37,000
It could be any one of these

2062
03:14:37,000 --> 03:14:42,000
There's like two or three versions of the same face and yeah, you gotta get it exact. I don't want to just yeah, I could have to figure it out

2063
03:14:45,000 --> 03:14:48,000
It looks like dark wing duck

2064
03:14:51,000 --> 03:14:53,000
Ah

2065
03:14:54,000 --> 03:14:56,000
Yeah, I'm gonna have to come back to this I think

2066
03:14:59,000 --> 03:15:02,000
There's no way I can do that without knowing what the right picture is

2067
03:15:06,000 --> 03:15:08,000
He can go in here

2068
03:15:08,000 --> 03:15:10,000
Maybe the pictures in here

2069
03:15:12,000 --> 03:15:14,000
That would sure be swell

2070
03:15:15,000 --> 03:15:17,000
You

2071
03:15:22,000 --> 03:15:24,000
There's the p-ha

2072
03:15:30,000 --> 03:15:34,000
Gotta write that down I have to draw this correctly

2073
03:15:35,000 --> 03:15:37,000
No, you know what fucking

2074
03:15:38,000 --> 03:15:43,000
This is what I'm going to take a picture of this is the one I'm gonna take the picture of

2075
03:15:43,000 --> 03:15:45,000
Haha

2076
03:15:45,000 --> 03:15:50,000
I went through all that trouble of describing the notebook. No, no, no, I gotta use like the notebook

2077
03:15:51,000 --> 03:15:54,000
The notebook is like it's so key. It's gotta be the notebook

2078
03:15:57,000 --> 03:16:00,000
I just went back on my word and I'm not using the notebook now

2079
03:16:02,000 --> 03:16:04,000
I just took a picture with my eye

2080
03:16:07,000 --> 03:16:09,000
Cheater

2081
03:16:09,000 --> 03:16:11,000
Wait, was there anything else in this room?

2082
03:16:13,000 --> 03:16:16,000
You want me to do if I draw this? Are you kidding me?

2083
03:16:18,000 --> 03:16:20,000
What was this?

2084
03:16:21,000 --> 03:16:25,000
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, hold on, I wrote all this down

2085
03:16:28,000 --> 03:16:30,000
Uh

2086
03:16:30,000 --> 03:16:32,000
So it was the this one

2087
03:16:33,000 --> 03:16:35,000
When it was filled in

2088
03:16:35,000 --> 03:16:37,000
With a plus and minus there

2089
03:16:38,000 --> 03:16:42,000
I could think I wrote it down

2090
03:16:45,000 --> 03:16:47,000
And then where is it?

2091
03:16:48,000 --> 03:16:50,000
The box in the middle this one

2092
03:16:52,000 --> 03:16:54,000
Okay, filled in is there another one that's not filled in?

2093
03:17:00,000 --> 03:17:02,000
That's that's all correct

2094
03:17:04,000 --> 03:17:06,000
What does that do?

2095
03:17:08,000 --> 03:17:10,000
I

2096
03:17:10,000 --> 03:17:12,000
Shouldn't this do something?

2097
03:17:12,000 --> 03:17:14,000
Their indication about it is did this?

2098
03:17:23,000 --> 03:17:25,000
Um

2099
03:17:25,000 --> 03:17:28,000
It was already on the second sequence. That's the thing

2100
03:17:31,000 --> 03:17:34,000
That's the way that I raised that obvious of gel

2101
03:17:35,000 --> 03:17:37,000
Our

2102
03:18:03,000 --> 03:18:04,000
You

2103
03:18:04,000 --> 03:18:06,000
What was that?

2104
03:18:10,000 --> 03:18:12,000
I can't move this anymore.

2105
03:18:14,000 --> 03:18:16,000
Well, there we go.

2106
03:18:21,000 --> 03:18:23,000
I don't know, I mean, I guess um...

2107
03:18:25,000 --> 03:18:27,000
Just for fun, I'm gonna put it back.

2108
03:18:27,000 --> 03:18:29,000
I'm gonna try the other one, just for fun.

2109
03:18:29,000 --> 03:18:31,000
Just make sure I didn't miss anything.

2110
03:18:35,000 --> 03:18:37,000
That's the other one.

2111
03:18:37,000 --> 03:18:41,000
So we're gonna put it on the one now, I guess, maybe I think it was on this one to begin with.

2112
03:18:57,000 --> 03:18:59,000
Black-Blank-Blank.

2113
03:19:03,000 --> 03:19:05,000
And this is right there.

2114
03:19:07,000 --> 03:19:10,000
I can't remember where that is right now.

2115
03:19:18,000 --> 03:19:20,000
Let's see, October.

2116
03:19:27,000 --> 03:19:34,000
Everyone's doing like the triangles.

2117
03:19:34,000 --> 03:19:38,000
Maybe that did change the path.

2118
03:19:38,000 --> 03:19:48,000
We'll find out.

2119
03:19:48,000 --> 03:19:54,000
So I am getting very hungry.

2120
03:19:54,000 --> 03:19:57,000
So I'm going to potentially do this.

2121
03:19:57,000 --> 03:19:58,000
I'm going to go get some food.

2122
03:19:58,000 --> 03:19:59,000
Oh, he's spitting something out.

2123
03:19:59,000 --> 03:20:00,000
That's right.

2124
03:20:00,000 --> 03:20:01,000
He's got this.

2125
03:20:01,000 --> 03:20:04,000
Maybe that.

2126
03:20:04,000 --> 03:20:10,000
Okay, let me look at this picture of Darkwing Duck.

2127
03:20:10,000 --> 03:20:20,000
The eyes, the head has, oh god, I can't even see.

2128
03:20:20,000 --> 03:20:25,000
I think this is the right head, right here.

2129
03:20:25,000 --> 03:20:29,000
I think.

2130
03:20:29,000 --> 03:20:32,000
Is that the right head?

2131
03:20:32,000 --> 03:20:36,000
Yes.

2132
03:20:36,000 --> 03:20:42,000
That is the right head.

2133
03:20:42,000 --> 03:20:45,000
So, I'm just going to go over here for now.

2134
03:20:45,000 --> 03:20:47,000
Where's the eyes?

2135
03:20:47,000 --> 03:20:49,000
Oh, this is going to be so hard for me to figure this shit out.

2136
03:20:49,000 --> 03:20:52,000
No, those are not right.

2137
03:20:52,000 --> 03:20:58,000
Where are the right eyes?

2138
03:20:58,000 --> 03:21:00,000
He's looking to the left kind of.

2139
03:21:00,000 --> 03:21:02,000
So I think it's down here.

2140
03:21:02,000 --> 03:21:07,000
I need to make sure I don't want to screw this one up.

2141
03:21:07,000 --> 03:21:14,000
So let's put it around.

2142
03:21:14,000 --> 03:21:15,000
Could be.

2143
03:21:15,000 --> 03:21:16,000
It could be.

2144
03:21:16,000 --> 03:21:21,000
Wait, what?

2145
03:21:21,000 --> 03:21:22,000
Hold on.

2146
03:21:22,000 --> 03:21:23,000
So it has to.

2147
03:21:23,000 --> 03:21:30,000
So it needs to go up because this doesn't fit down here.

2148
03:21:30,000 --> 03:21:34,000
God, this is making my head hurt.

2149
03:21:34,000 --> 03:21:39,000
Only three eyes and one of them.

2150
03:21:39,000 --> 03:21:40,000
Where's the helmet?

2151
03:21:40,000 --> 03:21:42,000
Where's the head?

2152
03:21:42,000 --> 03:21:44,000
Where's the right head?

2153
03:21:44,000 --> 03:21:47,000
I think so.

2154
03:21:47,000 --> 03:21:49,000
Let me get that over there.

2155
03:21:49,000 --> 03:21:56,000
This is going to be very slow because I need to make sure I'm doing this correctly.

2156
03:21:56,000 --> 03:21:58,000
Oh, shit.

2157
03:21:58,000 --> 03:22:02,000
Is that the right body?

2158
03:22:02,000 --> 03:22:04,000
I can't even.

2159
03:22:04,000 --> 03:22:07,000
I don't even know what piece of the body that is.

2160
03:22:07,000 --> 03:22:14,000
That is hands.

2161
03:22:14,000 --> 03:22:36,000
No, this has got to go up this way.

2162
03:22:36,000 --> 03:22:40,000
That's the right head for sure.

2163
03:22:40,000 --> 03:22:42,000
That is not the right eyes because look, it's in the right.

2164
03:22:42,000 --> 03:22:43,000
It's the wrong way.

2165
03:22:43,000 --> 03:22:49,000
So it really just determines how to match it up the right way.

2166
03:22:49,000 --> 03:22:59,000
So the right eyes are the ones that are down here.

2167
03:22:59,000 --> 03:23:09,000
Let's just see, I don't know.

2168
03:23:09,000 --> 03:23:11,000
So I flip this upside down.

2169
03:23:11,000 --> 03:23:18,000
Yep, those are the right ones.

2170
03:23:18,000 --> 03:23:22,000
I got to get those back up, shit.

2171
03:23:22,000 --> 03:23:25,000
Seeing all these pieces of really messing with my brain.

2172
03:23:25,000 --> 03:23:30,000
So these have to come back down.

2173
03:23:30,000 --> 03:23:45,000
I got to get that one out of the bottom though.

2174
03:23:45,000 --> 03:23:54,000
I'm just going to do this piece by piece.

2175
03:23:54,000 --> 03:23:56,000
Like, I'll figure it out later.

2176
03:23:56,000 --> 03:24:00,000
I think, hold on, what's that one?

2177
03:24:00,000 --> 03:24:04,000
Oh, shit, I lost the picture.

2178
03:24:04,000 --> 03:24:05,000
There it is.

2179
03:24:05,000 --> 03:24:14,000
Okay, so the body's hand comes across.

2180
03:24:14,000 --> 03:24:21,000
This is going to be very, very annoying.

2181
03:24:21,000 --> 03:24:23,000
I need the mouth.

2182
03:24:23,000 --> 03:24:26,000
This mouth has this leg.

2183
03:24:26,000 --> 03:24:30,000
That's it right there, right?

2184
03:24:30,000 --> 03:24:35,000
I think.

2185
03:24:35,000 --> 03:24:39,000
Pretty sure that's the right mouth.

2186
03:24:39,000 --> 03:24:43,000
Let's see.

2187
03:24:43,000 --> 03:25:02,000
Yep, that's correct.

2188
03:25:02,000 --> 03:25:04,000
Getting there, we're getting there.

2189
03:25:04,000 --> 03:25:06,000
We're getting closer.

2190
03:25:06,000 --> 03:25:10,000
Now I need to go down to his hand.

2191
03:25:10,000 --> 03:25:13,000
Which is the right way this way?

2192
03:25:13,000 --> 03:25:16,000
Nope.

2193
03:25:16,000 --> 03:25:24,000
It's hard to tell what the hand has even gone the right way here.

2194
03:25:24,000 --> 03:25:27,000
I think it's the one down the bottom.

2195
03:25:27,000 --> 03:25:33,000
This one.

2196
03:25:33,000 --> 03:25:39,000
Yes, it is.

2197
03:25:39,000 --> 03:25:47,000
Alright, what's the last one?

2198
03:25:47,000 --> 03:25:54,000
The hand coming down on the right.

2199
03:25:54,000 --> 03:25:58,000
It's like a bit, it's like fingers and shit.

2200
03:25:58,000 --> 03:25:59,000
Is it this one?

2201
03:25:59,000 --> 03:26:02,000
Is it the one that I just had?

2202
03:26:02,000 --> 03:26:07,000
Nope.

2203
03:26:07,000 --> 03:26:13,000
I'm not this one.

2204
03:26:13,000 --> 03:26:14,000
There it is.

2205
03:26:14,000 --> 03:26:15,000
Woo!

2206
03:26:15,000 --> 03:26:21,000
Okay, that was kind of strange.

2207
03:26:21,000 --> 03:26:30,000
No power.

2208
03:26:30,000 --> 03:26:33,000
No power.

2209
03:26:33,000 --> 03:26:38,000
I did pick up a power thing though.

2210
03:26:38,000 --> 03:26:47,000
I want to see what that potentially changed when I move to the blocks.

2211
03:26:47,000 --> 03:26:51,000
Because I didn't change all those blocks that were over here.

2212
03:26:51,000 --> 03:26:54,000
And boom.

2213
03:26:54,000 --> 03:27:01,000
Bottom boom.

2214
03:27:01,000 --> 03:27:08,000
Hey, look, power.

2215
03:27:08,000 --> 03:27:14,000
I'm assuming I can put this in here and then there'll be power.

2216
03:27:14,000 --> 03:27:17,000
And then this thing up to stairs that goes that way.

2217
03:27:17,000 --> 03:27:21,000
It's just positive figure out the game and went again.

2218
03:27:21,000 --> 03:27:35,000
This is the octopus part.

2219
03:27:35,000 --> 03:27:42,000
Remember I told you about the octopus?

2220
03:27:42,000 --> 03:27:49,000
I'm assuming I can put this in here.

2221
03:27:49,000 --> 03:27:56,000
I'm assuming I can put this in here.

2222
03:27:56,000 --> 03:28:03,000
I'm assuming I can put this in here.

2223
03:28:03,000 --> 03:28:21,000
Okay, well, the first octopus was the one with the rectangle.

2224
03:28:21,000 --> 03:28:32,000
So it's in the second one we saw was the, let me see, so servitude, family, hope, honor.

2225
03:28:32,000 --> 03:28:51,000
I'm just going to write underneath them, servitude, family.

2226
03:28:51,000 --> 03:29:01,000
This one is hope, servitude, honor.

2227
03:29:01,000 --> 03:29:08,000
Okay, bye-bye.

2228
03:29:08,000 --> 03:29:24,000
That should allow us to get in the door that we just had.

2229
03:29:24,000 --> 03:29:27,000
I'm actually curious about something.

2230
03:29:27,000 --> 03:29:36,000
I'm going to go up.

2231
03:29:36,000 --> 03:29:39,000
I'm going to go back down there, but I want to see what's in this room over here.

2232
03:29:39,000 --> 03:29:53,000
Because I can turn the power on now.

2233
03:29:53,000 --> 03:29:55,000
Oh, damn.

2234
03:29:55,000 --> 03:29:57,000
I just looked at the chat.

2235
03:29:57,000 --> 03:30:11,000
Now maybe they're speaking English now instead of, okay, that's kind of cool if that's what that did.

2236
03:30:11,000 --> 03:30:15,000
Yeah, yep, I can, I'm going to be able to understand them now.

2237
03:30:15,000 --> 03:30:17,000
So this is, this is cool.

2238
03:30:17,000 --> 03:30:18,000
This is cool.

2239
03:30:18,000 --> 03:30:20,000
This is going to tell the whole story.

2240
03:30:20,000 --> 03:30:23,000
We need to do it in order.

2241
03:30:23,000 --> 03:30:25,000
This is not the right order.

2242
03:30:25,000 --> 03:30:34,000
But I mean, this right here is the last part of the story right here.

2243
03:30:34,000 --> 03:30:36,000
You have made it far.

2244
03:30:36,000 --> 03:30:41,000
Mother and Father must be pleased with your courage and honor.

2245
03:30:41,000 --> 03:30:46,000
Yet always for not without saving the child.

2246
03:30:46,000 --> 03:30:54,000
And it's building a machine to extract her power of a process she will never survive.

2247
03:30:54,000 --> 03:31:01,000
It's the final piece you will need.

2248
03:31:01,000 --> 03:31:06,000
Just spit it down on me.

2249
03:31:06,000 --> 03:31:07,000
So what is it now?

2250
03:31:07,000 --> 03:31:09,000
I got to go listen to the other part of the story.

2251
03:31:09,000 --> 03:31:11,000
I got to go all the way back.

2252
03:31:11,000 --> 03:31:15,000
I'm going to talk about backtrack.

2253
03:31:15,000 --> 03:31:20,000
You think, you didn't think we were going to backtrack to the very beginning?

2254
03:31:20,000 --> 03:31:23,000
That's exactly what we're going to do.

2255
03:31:31,000 --> 03:31:34,000
We're going all the way back.

2256
03:31:34,000 --> 03:31:40,000
Does that want to see, I want to see it from the beginning.

2257
03:31:40,000 --> 03:31:43,000
You guys are ready.

2258
03:31:43,000 --> 03:31:47,000
Hope you guys are ready to go all the way back.

2259
03:31:47,000 --> 03:31:52,000
If I hadn't remembered how to get there.

2260
03:31:52,000 --> 03:31:56,000
This is going to take a long time.

2261
03:31:57,000 --> 03:32:03,000
Okay, no, I didn't do anything there.

2262
03:32:03,000 --> 03:32:14,000
So where is the last?

2263
03:32:14,000 --> 03:32:20,000
I don't know.

2264
03:32:20,000 --> 03:32:24,000
I don't know.

2265
03:32:24,000 --> 03:32:32,000
Big, big, say, I'll go back.

2266
03:32:32,000 --> 03:32:36,000
Can we even go all the way back?

2267
03:32:36,000 --> 03:32:38,000
I think we can.

2268
03:32:38,000 --> 03:32:41,000
I'm pretty sure we can.

2269
03:32:41,000 --> 03:32:47,000
Good luck.

2270
03:32:47,000 --> 03:32:51,000
Big, big change it back to normal and you.

2271
03:32:51,000 --> 03:32:59,000
Oh, good dog.

2272
03:32:59,000 --> 03:33:02,000
Can I get over on the other side?

2273
03:33:02,000 --> 03:33:05,000
There was a little like a...

2274
03:33:05,000 --> 03:33:08,000
I can go down.

2275
03:33:08,000 --> 03:33:15,000
I can do this.

2276
03:33:15,000 --> 03:33:22,000
Oh no.

2277
03:33:22,000 --> 03:33:28,000
Guys.

2278
03:33:28,000 --> 03:33:31,000
Please stop him.

2279
03:33:31,000 --> 03:33:33,000
I'll not...

2280
03:33:33,000 --> 03:33:37,000
Just through here.

2281
03:33:37,000 --> 03:33:40,000
This symbol was on the wall a while back.

2282
03:33:40,000 --> 03:33:44,000
This was somewhere too.

2283
03:33:44,000 --> 03:33:47,000
I didn't write him down.

2284
03:33:47,000 --> 03:33:49,000
I didn't write him down.

2285
03:33:49,000 --> 03:33:51,000
That's my downfall.

2286
03:33:51,000 --> 03:33:54,000
That didn't do it.

2287
03:33:54,000 --> 03:33:55,000
I didn't write these ones down.

2288
03:33:55,000 --> 03:33:58,000
Let's just go in and see what's going on here.

2289
03:33:58,000 --> 03:34:05,000
This is the baby.

2290
03:34:05,000 --> 03:34:12,000
Can I?

2291
03:34:12,000 --> 03:34:19,000
P, not so fast, brother of mine.

2292
03:34:19,000 --> 03:34:21,000
Vognon, come on.

2293
03:34:21,000 --> 03:34:23,000
Let's be reasonable.

2294
03:34:23,000 --> 03:34:26,000
You've got to let me get her out of that thing.

2295
03:34:26,000 --> 03:34:28,000
I'm not a pal.

2296
03:34:28,000 --> 03:34:30,000
I'm wasted on her anyhow.

2297
03:34:30,000 --> 03:34:32,000
I'll put it to real use.

2298
03:34:32,000 --> 03:34:35,000
Vognon, don't.

2299
03:34:35,000 --> 03:34:38,000
Sorry.

2300
03:34:38,000 --> 03:34:44,000
Too late.

2301
03:34:44,000 --> 03:34:47,000
What the?

2302
03:34:47,000 --> 03:34:52,000
Well, that was easy.

2303
03:34:53,000 --> 03:34:55,000
Oh shit.

2304
03:34:55,000 --> 03:34:59,000
Please kill my dog.

2305
03:35:11,000 --> 03:35:13,000
Don't worry.

2306
03:35:13,000 --> 03:35:15,000
I've got you.

2307
03:35:15,000 --> 03:35:19,000
I've got you.

2308
03:35:22,000 --> 03:35:36,000
I feel like we're not focusing on the fact that my dog is just instant.

2309
03:35:36,000 --> 03:35:49,000
The dog that's been with me the whole game is dead.

2310
03:35:49,000 --> 03:35:52,000
What the hell?

2311
03:35:52,000 --> 03:35:55,000
What?

2312
03:35:55,000 --> 03:35:58,000
Okay.

2313
03:35:58,000 --> 03:36:05,000
Big, big rest in peace.

2314
03:36:05,000 --> 03:36:10,000
Here are the less piece of power.

2315
03:36:10,000 --> 03:36:13,000
I can actually turn this on now.

2316
03:36:19,000 --> 03:36:26,000
Huh?

2317
03:36:26,000 --> 03:36:32,000
How do I even fill the...

2318
03:36:32,000 --> 03:36:40,000
I'm going to hope, servitude, honor, mustache guy.

2319
03:36:40,000 --> 03:36:46,000
I have the mustache.

2320
03:36:46,000 --> 03:36:49,000
Oh, okay.

2321
03:36:49,000 --> 03:36:52,000
Drag it.

2322
03:36:52,000 --> 03:37:01,000
Yeah, the symbol.

2323
03:37:01,000 --> 03:37:14,000
I feel like I need to watch the cutscenes again.

2324
03:37:14,000 --> 03:37:19,000
Let's go back to the first octopus.

2325
03:37:19,000 --> 03:37:23,000
That's what we're going to do to begin with.

2326
03:37:23,000 --> 03:37:28,000
Is this the first octopus?

2327
03:37:28,000 --> 03:37:32,000
So this is octopus number one.

2328
03:37:32,000 --> 03:37:34,000
This is octopus number one.

2329
03:37:34,000 --> 03:37:38,000
Let's see what he has to say.

2330
03:37:38,000 --> 03:37:41,000
Welcome.

2331
03:37:41,000 --> 03:37:44,000
I must tell you.

2332
03:37:44,000 --> 03:37:50,000
In service to father, my obligator kin and I have seen much underneath Grand Wall.

2333
03:37:50,000 --> 03:37:55,000
Most of it, Gloria, yet some tragic as well.

2334
03:37:55,000 --> 03:38:00,000
It is the planet's zero fly, where you now find yourself.

2335
03:38:00,000 --> 03:38:04,000
Intuned in the foreshared, on the cross.

2336
03:38:04,000 --> 03:38:07,000
I'm home, or science magic, pretty well.

2337
03:38:07,000 --> 03:38:09,000
And servitude.

2338
03:38:09,000 --> 03:38:13,000
That's serv- fuck.

2339
03:38:13,000 --> 03:38:17,000
I got it.

2340
03:38:17,000 --> 03:38:21,000
And other dangers and indigenous to zero five.

2341
03:38:21,000 --> 03:38:26,000
Then one day without warning, how do you come up?

2342
03:38:26,000 --> 03:38:33,000
You're attacked by a fierce warrior who while lighting ultimate power, possess intelligence,

2343
03:38:33,000 --> 03:38:40,000
intelligence, knowledge, and spiritual and religion's defense.

2344
03:38:40,000 --> 03:38:43,000
Father and mother.

2345
03:38:43,000 --> 03:38:46,000
Father and mother.

2346
03:38:46,000 --> 03:38:51,000
All I need is hope, servitude.

2347
03:38:51,000 --> 03:38:55,000
A lost soul, just taken by ego and envy.

2348
03:38:55,000 --> 03:39:02,000
So the power of our God for his own gain and song hyalurant, execute to this power.

2349
03:39:02,000 --> 03:39:10,000
And before the greatest end, the last step is struck down by his foe.

2350
03:39:10,000 --> 03:39:18,000
Struck down by his essence, his own hearing arm power.

2351
03:39:18,000 --> 03:39:21,000
Okay.

2352
03:39:21,000 --> 03:39:24,000
Bad guy comes, wants the power of the armor-crogged fortress.

2353
03:39:24,000 --> 03:39:27,000
Servitude is the X with the square with little lines on it.

2354
03:39:27,000 --> 03:39:32,000
Each one of these sentient octopi are going to give me one of those.

2355
03:39:32,000 --> 03:39:34,000
So that's the first one.

2356
03:39:34,000 --> 03:39:36,000
We're going to go to the second one.

2357
03:39:36,000 --> 03:39:40,000
So that this is the servitude.

2358
03:39:40,000 --> 03:39:42,000
And I got servitude from the rectangle.

2359
03:39:42,000 --> 03:39:44,000
I remember that.

2360
03:39:44,000 --> 03:39:49,000
There's no one can stop you fucking meds.

2361
03:39:49,000 --> 03:39:52,000
Seriously.

2362
03:39:52,000 --> 03:39:55,000
Okay. So now what was the second one?

2363
03:39:55,000 --> 03:40:00,000
Second octopus is this way?

2364
03:40:00,000 --> 03:40:03,000
I got a pee again.

2365
03:40:03,000 --> 03:40:10,000
What?

2366
03:40:10,000 --> 03:40:16,000
I just heard, did he just...

2367
03:40:16,000 --> 03:40:21,000
Did it just hear the dog?

2368
03:40:21,000 --> 03:40:31,000
That's what I got.

2369
03:40:31,000 --> 03:40:36,000
Oh yeah, I have multiple pieces of paper.

2370
03:40:36,000 --> 03:40:40,000
Which is all over the place.

2371
03:40:40,000 --> 03:40:42,000
I'm hungry too.

2372
03:40:42,000 --> 03:40:44,000
I feel like I'm pretty close to the end though.

2373
03:40:44,000 --> 03:40:48,000
In the next maybe half hour 45.

2374
03:40:48,000 --> 03:40:55,000
I'm at the wrong way.

2375
03:40:55,000 --> 03:40:57,000
What was the second octopus?

2376
03:40:57,000 --> 03:40:59,000
Down around this way, right?

2377
03:40:59,000 --> 03:41:06,000
This is the second area to go to.

2378
03:41:06,000 --> 03:41:26,000
Beak, beak.

2379
03:41:26,000 --> 03:41:29,000
How many bugs have I've actually seen?

2380
03:41:29,000 --> 03:41:33,000
Believe it or not, I heard this game had a lot of technical problems with it.

2381
03:41:33,000 --> 03:41:36,000
I don't think I've seen any.

2382
03:41:36,000 --> 03:41:39,000
I don't think I've seen one technical bug with this game.

2383
03:41:39,000 --> 03:41:47,000
Why is this blocked?

2384
03:41:47,000 --> 03:41:51,000
Is the store's locked now?

2385
03:41:51,000 --> 03:41:53,000
Okay.

2386
03:41:53,000 --> 03:41:57,000
Why is this store blocked?

2387
03:41:57,000 --> 03:42:00,000
That's unfortunate.

2388
03:42:00,000 --> 03:42:03,000
Yeah, the only bug I've seen was with audio.

2389
03:42:03,000 --> 03:42:13,000
There was one bug in like the four hours or whatever I've been playing this game.

2390
03:42:13,000 --> 03:42:18,000
I have to go down.

2391
03:42:18,000 --> 03:42:33,000
Have I even gone this way?

2392
03:42:33,000 --> 03:42:38,000
I don't even remember.

2393
03:42:38,000 --> 03:42:47,000
Here we are.

2394
03:42:48,000 --> 03:42:50,000
Which one is this?

2395
03:42:50,000 --> 03:42:53,000
Is an octopus in here?

2396
03:42:53,000 --> 03:42:58,000
This is the third one or the fourth one?

2397
03:42:58,000 --> 03:43:04,000
This is the second octopus.

2398
03:43:04,000 --> 03:43:06,000
I believe.

2399
03:43:06,000 --> 03:43:08,000
Let's get it.

2400
03:43:08,000 --> 03:43:10,000
I got my hands ready.

2401
03:43:10,000 --> 03:43:16,000
My activator, Sivlin, told you of the attack upon Spur of Five I presume.

2402
03:43:16,000 --> 03:43:19,000
Allow me to continue.

2403
03:43:19,000 --> 03:43:21,000
Our fortress had been breached.

2404
03:43:21,000 --> 03:43:24,000
The father was prepared.

2405
03:43:24,000 --> 03:43:31,000
Designed with an unlock was a hidden defense mechanism father added to ensure the safety of his planet.

2406
03:43:31,000 --> 03:43:34,000
His people, his family.

2407
03:43:35,000 --> 03:43:40,000
The children had attacked, believing he was not a father who was key to the power he desired.

2408
03:43:40,000 --> 03:43:43,000
But she knew the truth.

2409
03:43:43,000 --> 03:43:47,000
The power resides in their infant daughter, Peele.

2410
03:43:47,000 --> 03:43:49,000
Hiding Pee from sight.

2411
03:43:49,000 --> 03:43:52,000
Mother hurry to initiate father's plan.

2412
03:43:52,000 --> 03:43:57,000
But was interrupted just as she began the activation procedure.

2413
03:43:57,000 --> 03:44:00,000
The attruder called Vognant.

2414
03:44:00,000 --> 03:44:04,000
Some others empty shell and realized his mistake.

2415
03:44:04,000 --> 03:44:07,000
She did not hold the power after all.

2416
03:44:07,000 --> 03:44:10,000
There must be another.

2417
03:44:10,000 --> 03:44:13,000
The child.

2418
03:44:13,000 --> 03:44:15,000
Okay.

2419
03:44:15,000 --> 03:44:20,000
Family is the circle with the three circles on it.

2420
03:44:25,000 --> 03:44:27,000
All right.

2421
03:44:27,000 --> 03:44:30,000
We have a servitude family.

2422
03:44:30,000 --> 03:44:33,000
We need hope.

2423
03:44:33,000 --> 03:44:36,000
What was the other one?

2424
03:44:36,000 --> 03:44:39,000
Hope.

2425
03:44:39,000 --> 03:44:42,000
Shit.

2426
03:44:42,000 --> 03:44:49,000
It's not the right way.

2427
03:44:49,000 --> 03:44:54,000
Hope and honor of the last two.

2428
03:44:57,000 --> 03:45:02,000
I feel like I need to suck something up this time.

2429
03:45:02,000 --> 03:45:06,000
Wasn't there a couple of the button I pressed.

2430
03:45:06,000 --> 03:45:10,000
And it made the vacuum sound.

2431
03:45:10,000 --> 03:45:14,000
Am I crazy?

2432
03:45:14,000 --> 03:45:19,000
Remember when peak peak was up there and there was a button to press and it made the vacuum sound?

2433
03:45:19,000 --> 03:45:22,000
I don't know.

2434
03:45:27,000 --> 03:45:30,000
Where's the dog?

2435
03:45:30,000 --> 03:45:34,000
I think you might have missed what happened earlier.

2436
03:45:34,000 --> 03:45:41,000
I'm going to go down the vine.

2437
03:45:41,000 --> 03:45:48,000
Down the vine.

2438
03:45:48,000 --> 03:45:51,000
What was out here?

2439
03:45:51,000 --> 03:45:55,000
I forget whether it was a tree.

2440
03:45:55,000 --> 03:46:00,000
I'm going to go down the vine.

2441
03:46:01,000 --> 03:46:05,000
What was out here?

2442
03:46:05,000 --> 03:46:10,000
I forget what it all was.

2443
03:46:10,000 --> 03:46:17,000
Because through this door is where he flies up and hits the button.

2444
03:46:17,000 --> 03:46:24,000
So we get to go down here.

2445
03:46:25,000 --> 03:46:28,000
Let's continue.

2446
03:46:28,000 --> 03:46:35,000
Did I miss one of the sentient octopus people?

2447
03:46:35,000 --> 03:46:44,000
I feel like I missed somebody.

2448
03:46:44,000 --> 03:46:49,000
I forget which way to go.

2449
03:46:49,000 --> 03:46:56,000
That's not that way.

2450
03:46:56,000 --> 03:47:01,000
There's the 50-50.

2451
03:47:01,000 --> 03:47:08,000
There's the 5% 50.

2452
03:47:08,000 --> 03:47:15,000
I'm going to go down there.

2453
03:47:15,000 --> 03:47:22,000
Go on, get on there, get up.

2454
03:47:22,000 --> 03:47:28,000
Speed it up, speed it up.

2455
03:47:28,000 --> 03:47:31,000
Anything change up here with these weird birds?

2456
03:47:31,000 --> 03:47:34,000
I swear it's going to be like...

2457
03:47:34,000 --> 03:47:39,000
And remember the 5 birds of our ancestors.

2458
03:47:39,000 --> 03:47:45,000
Pinky, Grayson, Pink Mondo, Pink Mordel and Gray Sanibi.

2459
03:47:45,000 --> 03:47:47,000
Remember their names?

2460
03:47:47,000 --> 03:47:50,000
I swear it's going to be something like that.

2461
03:47:50,000 --> 03:47:56,000
Whatever.

2462
03:47:56,000 --> 03:48:03,000
Let's go!

2463
03:48:03,000 --> 03:48:10,000
Derma is auto-okay.

2464
03:48:10,000 --> 03:48:17,000
I had a dream where you left him outside and he had to eat his own poop.

2465
03:48:17,000 --> 03:48:22,000
He's right here and he's well fed, don't worry.

2466
03:48:22,000 --> 03:48:25,000
That's an odd dream to have.

2467
03:48:25,000 --> 03:48:30,000
Derma is your dog all right.

2468
03:48:30,000 --> 03:48:32,000
What are you doing man?

2469
03:48:32,000 --> 03:48:37,000
Let's activate it again.

2470
03:48:37,000 --> 03:49:00,000
Let's see what you have to say.

2471
03:49:00,000 --> 03:49:05,000
Did I already do this one?

2472
03:49:05,000 --> 03:49:10,000
No, I didn't.

2473
03:49:10,000 --> 03:49:17,000
I missed one, but we'll get it though.

2474
03:49:17,000 --> 03:49:20,000
You know a lot of not.

2475
03:49:20,000 --> 03:49:23,000
You know the attack.

2476
03:49:23,000 --> 03:49:28,000
A lot of not believing mother was dead.

2477
03:49:28,000 --> 03:49:32,000
But mother was still alive in a patch.

2478
03:49:32,000 --> 03:49:37,000
She had used the soul transfer device to insert her being into the fortress.

2479
03:49:37,000 --> 03:49:42,000
The first of a two step process which would activate father's defense mechanism.

2480
03:49:42,000 --> 03:49:46,000
Yes, she had narrowly escaped while not splashed.

2481
03:49:46,000 --> 03:49:52,000
But the soul transfer device was destroyed forever trapping her within the wall of the armcrab.

2482
03:49:52,000 --> 03:49:59,000
The original plan was for father to use the soul transfer device to complete the first step.

2483
03:49:59,000 --> 03:50:04,000
The soul would insert herself into armcrab while mother would perform the second step.

2484
03:50:04,000 --> 03:50:09,000
How rough the machinery, the control panel located it in the ample room.

2485
03:50:09,000 --> 03:50:16,000
However, with father killed by father not, mother's only option was to inhabit the fortress herself.

2486
03:50:16,000 --> 03:50:21,000
And hope that father's spirit could somehow find a way to activate the console.

2487
03:50:21,000 --> 03:50:26,000
Unlikely, yes, but this was her only hope.

2488
03:50:26,000 --> 03:50:32,000
Thankfully father's spirit appeared to have found a way.

2489
03:50:32,000 --> 03:50:35,000
You know what's really funny about this?

2490
03:50:35,000 --> 03:50:39,000
Star was in this call like four hours ago.

2491
03:50:39,000 --> 03:50:48,000
And he said, wouldn't it be funny if all the things that these octopus were saying was just how to beat the game?

2492
03:50:48,000 --> 03:50:53,000
And he called it.

2493
03:50:53,000 --> 03:50:57,000
Good job. Good for you.

2494
03:50:57,000 --> 03:51:00,000
Now all we're missing is honor.

2495
03:51:08,000 --> 03:51:13,000
Honor and then we can pull the thing off the crystal.

2496
03:51:13,000 --> 03:51:20,000
That one was the, you know what I haven't been doing.

2497
03:51:20,000 --> 03:51:25,000
Shit, I haven't been, oh no, hold on.

2498
03:51:25,000 --> 03:51:27,000
I gotta go back.

2499
03:51:27,000 --> 03:51:34,000
I need to write down what the symbol was above that octopi head.

2500
03:51:34,000 --> 03:51:40,000
Because I feel like I'm gonna need to know that.

2501
03:51:43,000 --> 03:51:50,000
So that was the piece facing this way.

2502
03:51:50,000 --> 03:51:55,000
Isn't that was hope?

2503
03:52:13,000 --> 03:52:20,000
I didn't write down which one was above the one that was family, unfortunately.

2504
03:52:20,000 --> 03:52:23,000
Chopper!

2505
03:52:38,000 --> 03:52:42,000
Keep going.

2506
03:52:44,000 --> 03:52:48,000
Didn't I already see this one though?

2507
03:52:48,000 --> 03:52:53,000
Did I, I must have missed one.

2508
03:52:53,000 --> 03:52:56,000
No, ah, come on.

2509
03:52:56,000 --> 03:53:03,000
That's annoying.

2510
03:53:03,000 --> 03:53:08,000
Hold me up.

2511
03:53:13,000 --> 03:53:20,000
Sorry, this is the one, was this servitude?

2512
03:53:20,000 --> 03:53:25,000
No, this, okay, so this one is, what was this one?

2513
03:53:25,000 --> 03:53:28,000
Is this family?

2514
03:53:28,000 --> 03:53:33,000
Mother and father must be pleased with your courage and honor.

2515
03:53:33,000 --> 03:53:37,000
There it is, there it is.

2516
03:53:37,000 --> 03:53:42,000
Vognoth has her and is building a machine to extract her power.

2517
03:53:42,000 --> 03:53:46,000
Of a process she will never survive.

2518
03:53:46,000 --> 03:53:52,000
Takes us, it's the final piece you want me to do.

2519
03:53:52,000 --> 03:53:55,000
So make sure I got it, the right.

2520
03:53:55,000 --> 03:54:00,000
Mother and father must be pleased with your courage and honor.

2521
03:54:00,000 --> 03:54:05,000
The square with the, all try not without seeing the child.

2522
03:54:06,000 --> 03:54:09,000
Vognoth has her.

2523
03:54:09,000 --> 03:54:11,000
Alright.

2524
03:54:11,000 --> 03:54:16,000
Sad square.

2525
03:54:16,000 --> 03:54:23,000
I can now do that puzzle.

2526
03:54:24,000 --> 03:54:29,000
Let's go.

2527
03:54:29,000 --> 03:54:35,000
Baby back.

2528
03:54:35,000 --> 03:54:41,000
Let's do it.

2529
03:54:41,000 --> 03:54:46,000
Let's finish this up, huh?

2530
03:54:47,000 --> 03:54:53,000
Alright.

2531
03:54:53,000 --> 03:54:55,000
Servitude goes here.

2532
03:54:55,000 --> 03:55:02,000
Servitude was the circle of the X.

2533
03:55:02,000 --> 03:55:09,000
Where is it?

2534
03:55:09,000 --> 03:55:10,000
Is that it now?

2535
03:55:10,000 --> 03:55:15,000
Which one is servitude?

2536
03:55:16,000 --> 03:55:21,000
Where is it going with the circles, right?

2537
03:55:21,000 --> 03:55:24,000
Was it that one I was just on?

2538
03:55:24,000 --> 03:55:27,000
Because that one, that's family.

2539
03:55:27,000 --> 03:55:30,000
That's honor.

2540
03:55:30,000 --> 03:55:33,000
That's hope.

2541
03:55:33,000 --> 03:55:38,000
This one was servitude, right?

2542
03:55:38,000 --> 03:55:44,000
I've wrote it down with like, I've wrote it down like crazy.

2543
03:55:44,000 --> 03:55:54,000
I'm going to, which one does it match up with?

2544
03:55:54,000 --> 03:55:56,000
That one is hope.

2545
03:55:56,000 --> 03:56:01,000
So that goes over here.

2546
03:56:01,000 --> 03:56:04,000
There.

2547
03:56:04,000 --> 03:56:08,000
Where is family?

2548
03:56:08,000 --> 03:56:13,000
Family goes.

2549
03:56:13,000 --> 03:56:18,000
There.

2550
03:56:18,000 --> 03:56:20,000
No, wait.

2551
03:56:20,000 --> 03:56:26,000
Yeah, the honor goes there.

2552
03:56:26,000 --> 03:56:32,000
Alright, my servitude is like, I don't even know which one it is.

2553
03:56:32,000 --> 03:56:39,000
Is it this one?

2554
03:56:39,000 --> 03:56:42,000
And then we go back into this room.

2555
03:56:42,000 --> 03:56:46,000
We pull the thing down so it gets down here so we get the power away.

2556
03:56:46,000 --> 03:56:49,000
Where the fuck is Big Big?

2557
03:56:49,000 --> 03:56:51,000
Okay, thank God.

2558
03:56:51,000 --> 03:56:53,000
I don't even need him.

2559
03:56:53,000 --> 03:57:00,000
Or do I?

2560
03:57:00,000 --> 03:57:06,000
Alrighty.

2561
03:57:06,000 --> 03:57:20,000
Whoa.

2562
03:57:20,000 --> 03:57:21,000
That, alright.

2563
03:57:21,000 --> 03:57:27,000
Press the button.

2564
03:57:27,000 --> 03:57:30,000
Oh, this is the...

2565
03:57:30,000 --> 03:57:41,000
I wrote this down a long time ago.

2566
03:57:41,000 --> 03:57:50,000
This is a short, it's shortest one.

2567
03:57:50,000 --> 03:58:04,000
I'm going to need to be short.

2568
03:58:04,000 --> 03:58:07,000
Oh no, I got to go look at it again.

2569
03:58:07,000 --> 03:58:21,000
It's like a weird accordion.

2570
03:58:21,000 --> 03:58:28,000
That's not it.

2571
03:58:28,000 --> 03:58:33,000
Didn't write this down good enough.

2572
03:58:33,000 --> 03:58:36,000
Mine is just like teeth.

2573
03:58:36,000 --> 03:58:43,000
Is it the other way or the other way?

2574
03:58:43,000 --> 03:59:01,000
Let's see how big they are.

2575
03:59:01,000 --> 03:59:04,000
It's all gets deeper though.

2576
03:59:04,000 --> 03:59:07,000
I think I can still look at it.

2577
03:59:07,000 --> 03:59:10,000
I'm pretty sure I can still look at it.

2578
03:59:10,000 --> 03:59:13,000
Isn't it down?

2579
03:59:13,000 --> 03:59:16,000
It was a super Mario ship I remember, but...

2580
03:59:16,000 --> 03:59:21,000
Is there a way I can still see it?

2581
03:59:32,000 --> 03:59:36,000
Isn't the room with the light bulb?

2582
03:59:36,000 --> 03:59:40,000
There it is.

2583
03:59:40,000 --> 03:59:43,000
The fat one goes at the end.

2584
03:59:43,000 --> 03:59:47,000
And then it's just a nice straight line.

2585
03:59:47,000 --> 03:59:55,000
Fat one goes at the end.

2586
03:59:55,000 --> 03:59:57,000
At least I know that.

2587
03:59:57,000 --> 04:00:16,000
I can get it done.

2588
04:00:16,000 --> 04:00:20,000
Fat one at the end.

2589
04:00:27,000 --> 04:00:33,000
Let's get them in there and take a look.

2590
04:00:33,000 --> 04:00:39,000
Which one is the smallest one?

2591
04:00:39,000 --> 04:00:48,000
This one right?

2592
04:00:48,000 --> 04:00:51,000
The one that's in here, the little list.

2593
04:00:51,000 --> 04:01:05,000
Not quite.

2594
04:01:05,000 --> 04:01:13,000
Oh, that's in there deep, huh?

2595
04:01:13,000 --> 04:01:16,000
You stay there.

2596
04:01:16,000 --> 04:01:18,000
That's not small enough.

2597
04:01:18,000 --> 04:01:22,000
That's too small.

2598
04:01:22,000 --> 04:01:25,000
That's not it either.

2599
04:01:25,000 --> 04:01:28,000
I guess it was that one.

2600
04:01:28,000 --> 04:01:42,000
I guess.

2601
04:01:42,000 --> 04:01:52,000
Interesting.

2602
04:01:52,000 --> 04:01:59,000
Okay, hold on, hold on.

2603
04:01:59,000 --> 04:02:04,000
Hmm, why?

2604
04:02:04,000 --> 04:02:09,000
This one has to be the smallest one.

2605
04:02:09,000 --> 04:02:12,000
I can't see that that one or that one.

2606
04:02:12,000 --> 04:02:15,000
That has to be one of these two.

2607
04:02:15,000 --> 04:02:20,000
Which one is smaller to those?

2608
04:02:20,000 --> 04:02:23,000
I can't tell if those are exactly the same.

2609
04:02:23,000 --> 04:02:27,000
I'm going to line this up.

2610
04:02:27,000 --> 04:02:32,000
That one looks like a little bit lower.

2611
04:02:39,000 --> 04:02:47,000
Huh.

2612
04:02:47,000 --> 04:02:49,000
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

2613
04:02:49,000 --> 04:03:04,000
Am I fizzled? Did I flippet?

2614
04:03:04,000 --> 04:03:06,000
Oh, shit.

2615
04:03:06,000 --> 04:03:07,000
Whoa, okay.

2616
04:03:07,000 --> 04:03:08,000
All right.

2617
04:03:08,000 --> 04:03:15,000
Well, that's a thing that exists.

2618
04:03:15,000 --> 04:03:17,000
Now to get this right.

2619
04:03:17,000 --> 04:03:18,000
Oh, boy.

2620
04:03:18,000 --> 04:03:31,000
Let's just through a bunch.

2621
04:03:31,000 --> 04:03:32,000
Oh, boy.

2622
04:03:32,000 --> 04:03:41,000
This is going to be annoying.

2623
04:03:41,000 --> 04:03:42,000
That one's...

2624
04:03:42,000 --> 04:03:44,000
Whatever one is the lowest here.

2625
04:03:44,000 --> 04:03:45,000
So it looks like it's there.

2626
04:03:45,000 --> 04:03:50,000
There, there, there, and there.

2627
04:03:50,000 --> 04:03:57,000
Tommy Knot, you have saved my daughter with your acts of servitude and honor.

2628
04:03:57,000 --> 04:04:04,000
He has given you her plutonium crystals, which will provide your planet with power for eternity.

2629
04:04:04,000 --> 04:04:07,000
Because you have shown yourself to be a true hero.

2630
04:04:07,000 --> 04:04:11,000
I can now give you what you need to complete your journey.

2631
04:04:11,000 --> 04:04:13,000
Away home.

2632
04:04:13,000 --> 04:04:21,000
Activate tower transformation.

2633
04:04:21,000 --> 04:04:31,000
Tower transformation.

2634
04:04:31,000 --> 04:04:34,000
Tower transformation.

2635
04:04:34,000 --> 04:04:35,000
Complete.

2636
04:04:35,000 --> 04:04:39,000
Giant robot mob lives and ready for takeoff.

2637
04:04:39,000 --> 04:04:40,000
Give it a count of words.

2638
04:04:40,000 --> 04:04:41,000
Count of me, birds are there.

2639
04:04:41,000 --> 04:04:42,000
Thank you.

2640
04:04:42,000 --> 04:04:47,000
Ah ha, Tommy Knot.

2641
04:04:47,000 --> 04:04:49,000
Do you think you're a hero?

2642
04:04:49,000 --> 04:04:53,000
Just wait, thy blessed human and baby back to fiber's hand.

2643
04:04:53,000 --> 04:04:55,000
What the?

2644
04:04:55,000 --> 04:04:56,000
Oh.

2645
04:04:56,000 --> 04:05:04,000
Get destroyed.

2646
04:05:04,000 --> 04:05:11,000
Down vote, Tommy.

2647
04:05:11,000 --> 04:05:14,000
Bikki.

2648
04:05:14,000 --> 04:05:18,000
No, the dog.

2649
04:05:18,000 --> 04:05:21,000
Hey Tommy.

2650
04:05:21,000 --> 04:05:23,000
I feel kind of funny.

2651
04:05:23,000 --> 04:05:24,000
Bikki?

2652
04:05:24,000 --> 04:05:27,000
You're alive.

2653
04:05:27,000 --> 04:05:29,000
I'm alive.

2654
04:05:29,000 --> 04:05:30,000
I'm alive.

2655
04:05:30,000 --> 04:05:32,000
I feel kind of funny.

2656
04:05:32,000 --> 04:05:33,000
Bikki?

2657
04:05:33,000 --> 04:05:35,000
You're alive.

2658
04:05:35,000 --> 04:05:38,000
If by alive you mean hungry, then yeah.

2659
04:05:38,000 --> 04:05:40,000
Sure, I'm alive.

2660
04:05:40,000 --> 04:05:41,000
Come on little buddy.

2661
04:05:41,000 --> 04:05:43,000
We're heading home.

2662
04:05:43,000 --> 04:05:45,000
Maybe, maybe.

2663
04:05:45,000 --> 04:05:47,000
Step into seven.

2664
04:05:47,000 --> 04:05:49,000
Outside darshan's wall.

2665
04:05:49,000 --> 04:05:51,000
Maybe, maybe.

2666
04:05:51,000 --> 04:05:52,000
What do you know?

2667
04:05:52,000 --> 04:05:53,000
It's numb not.

2668
04:05:53,000 --> 04:05:55,000
Maybe, maybe.

2669
04:05:55,000 --> 04:05:56,000
Bikki?

2670
04:05:56,000 --> 04:05:59,000
Change coordinates to Darshan's orb.

2671
04:05:59,000 --> 04:06:01,000
Aye aye, captain.

2672
04:06:01,000 --> 04:06:04,000
I always wanted to say that.

2673
04:06:04,000 --> 04:06:07,000
Look at that like big practical effect.

2674
04:06:07,000 --> 04:06:17,000
I'm alive.

2675
04:06:17,000 --> 04:06:22,000
Did I win?

2676
04:06:22,000 --> 04:06:29,000
Darshan's orb.

2677
04:06:29,000 --> 04:06:36,000
Darshan's orb.

2678
04:06:36,000 --> 04:06:44,000
Yeah!

2679
04:06:44,000 --> 04:06:46,000
No, that's not it.

2680
04:06:46,000 --> 04:06:55,000
Don't forget about the secret at the end.

2681
04:06:55,000 --> 04:07:05,000
I'm hearing like two songs at the same time here.

2682
04:07:05,000 --> 04:07:06,000
Options.

2683
04:07:06,000 --> 04:07:08,000
Same the game.

2684
04:07:08,000 --> 04:07:12,000
All right, well.

2685
04:07:12,000 --> 04:07:16,000
Listen to all the music.

2686
04:07:16,000 --> 04:07:24,000
The sad music and the title theme of the same time.

2687
04:07:24,000 --> 04:07:29,000
Yeah.

2688
04:07:29,000 --> 04:07:44,000
Okay, let me go back to the hold on a second.

2689
04:07:44,000 --> 04:07:46,000
All right.

2690
04:07:46,000 --> 04:07:49,000
Well.

2691
04:07:49,000 --> 04:07:51,000
So that was the game.

2692
04:07:51,000 --> 04:07:53,000
Pretty short.

2693
04:07:53,000 --> 04:08:02,000
It was about four hours or so to beat the game.

2694
04:08:02,000 --> 04:08:04,000
It was, uh, it was good.

2695
04:08:04,000 --> 04:08:05,000
That was fun.

2696
04:08:05,000 --> 04:08:06,000
That was interesting.

2697
04:08:06,000 --> 04:08:09,000
I enjoyed that four hours.

2698
04:08:09,000 --> 04:08:13,000
I wish it was a little longer.

2699
04:08:13,000 --> 04:08:16,000
Maybe like a part two kind of where you go to like a different planet or something.

2700
04:08:16,000 --> 04:08:20,000
But that was cool.

2701
04:08:20,000 --> 04:08:23,000
I don't know what I did here.

2702
04:08:23,000 --> 04:08:30,000
I was like, I scribbled on this.

2703
04:08:30,000 --> 04:08:33,000
Now we want to see the notebook out.

2704
04:08:33,000 --> 04:08:36,000
Um, I'll tell you know what, let's see.

2705
04:08:36,000 --> 04:08:39,000
Can I take a couple pictures of this?

2706
04:08:39,000 --> 04:08:41,000
I don't even know what I did here.

2707
04:08:41,000 --> 04:08:49,000
I was like, I scribbled on this.

2708
04:08:49,000 --> 04:08:51,000
Now these are my notes.

2709
04:08:51,000 --> 04:08:55,000
These will stay my notes forever.

2710
04:08:55,000 --> 04:09:04,000
Yeah, what did the ant, the theater Roosevelt ant, he didn't do anything, did he?

2711
04:09:04,000 --> 04:09:07,000
I feel like there are some things that I missed.

2712
04:09:07,000 --> 04:09:08,000
Right.

2713
04:09:08,000 --> 04:09:18,000
Like I feel like there are a couple things that I didn't do that could have added some time.

2714
04:09:18,000 --> 04:09:31,000
Shit, that was um, that was armacrog.

2715
04:09:31,000 --> 04:09:33,000
Time is it 10.30.

2716
04:09:33,000 --> 04:09:35,000
Four hours.

2717
04:09:35,000 --> 04:09:38,000
I really would have liked to have seen it be like six.

2718
04:09:38,000 --> 04:09:42,000
I thought I said, all right.

2719
04:09:42,000 --> 04:09:45,000
Like 10 would be like, well, that's what that's way up there.

2720
04:09:45,000 --> 04:09:47,000
Because it neverhood wasn't even that long.

2721
04:09:47,000 --> 04:09:51,000
The neverhood was like maybe five or six, maybe total.

2722
04:09:51,000 --> 04:10:00,000
It might have even been like the same and I just don't remember.

2723
04:10:00,000 --> 04:10:02,000
But I mean, they did what they could.

2724
04:10:02,000 --> 04:10:07,000
It was only a team of like three or four people I think that put almost 90% of that game together.

2725
04:10:07,000 --> 04:10:13,000
So it's pretty impressive because it was just a Kickstarter kind of game.

2726
04:10:13,000 --> 04:10:17,000
That's off to the guys that could put all that animation work and all that design work together.

2727
04:10:17,000 --> 04:10:19,000
And a little under a year, I think.

2728
04:10:19,000 --> 04:10:24,000
Year in like some odd months.

2729
04:10:24,000 --> 04:10:29,000
And what I've liked to have seen it go on for like another hour or two, yes, absolutely.

2730
04:10:29,000 --> 04:10:31,000
But it was what it was.

2731
04:10:31,000 --> 04:10:38,000
And I thought it was fun.

2732
04:10:38,000 --> 04:10:46,000
So two hours if we try to explain the notebook.

2733
04:10:46,000 --> 04:10:47,000
Yeah, they did.

2734
04:10:47,000 --> 04:10:48,000
I'll give them.

2735
04:10:48,000 --> 04:10:55,000
I'll give them a round of applause for their accomplishment because that was pretty damn cool.

2736
04:10:55,000 --> 04:11:00,000
Am I going to make any YouTube videos out of these streams?

2737
04:11:00,000 --> 04:11:03,000
Probably not.

2738
04:11:03,000 --> 04:11:15,000
Maybe I would make eventually like a playlist and upload highlights of or something.

2739
04:11:15,000 --> 04:11:20,000
Oh boy, I'm starving though.

2740
04:11:20,000 --> 04:11:21,000
And credit.

2741
04:11:21,000 --> 04:11:22,000
Probably was something of the end.

2742
04:11:22,000 --> 04:11:25,000
I probably should have watched the whole thing.

2743
04:11:25,000 --> 04:11:26,000
But for any that was an end of game.

2744
04:11:26,000 --> 04:11:32,000
I think that it was just over just under I think a million dollars.

2745
04:11:32,000 --> 04:11:39,000
And for what the game actually was for all that work and all that shit that had to go into it.

2746
04:11:39,000 --> 04:11:45,000
Like $900,000 is not a lot of money when you're making an entire game in claymation.

2747
04:11:45,000 --> 04:11:49,000
So that was cool.

2748
04:11:49,000 --> 04:11:52,000
Considering the fact that I played broken age.

2749
04:11:52,000 --> 04:11:56,000
And broken age was just about like three hours long.

2750
04:11:56,000 --> 04:11:59,000
And that game took in like millions of dollars, didn't it?

2751
04:11:59,000 --> 04:12:04,000
And that game was like a 2D hand drawn game.

2752
04:12:04,000 --> 04:12:08,000
So all the guys at pencil test and like Doug to Naples and you know,

2753
04:12:08,000 --> 04:12:10,000
all the guys that worked on the game.

2754
04:12:10,000 --> 04:12:13,000
Very, very nice job.

2755
04:12:13,000 --> 04:12:25,000
I much enjoyed that.

2756
04:12:25,000 --> 04:12:28,000
And with that.

2757
04:12:28,000 --> 04:12:30,000
That's gonna wrap it up.

2758
04:12:30,000 --> 04:12:32,000
I'm actually kind of glad I got the whole thing done on one stream.

2759
04:12:32,000 --> 04:12:35,000
That's kind of cool.

2760
04:12:35,000 --> 04:12:43,000
When my name just like popped up that I know where that was crazy.

2761
04:12:43,000 --> 04:12:46,000
I'm actually surprised that that was just in there.

2762
04:12:46,000 --> 04:12:51,000
I know that because I because obviously I was a huge never heard fan and a huge like earthworm gym fan.

2763
04:12:51,000 --> 04:12:58,000
So I gave enough money I think to be put somewhere in a game somewhere.

2764
04:12:58,000 --> 04:13:02,000
And that took me off card and that was funny.

2765
04:13:02,000 --> 04:13:05,000
But yeah, games are very expensive.

2766
04:13:05,000 --> 04:13:08,000
Very, very expensive.

2767
04:13:08,000 --> 04:13:12,000
Now if this if pencil test got like 10 million dollars or like 30,

2768
04:13:12,000 --> 04:13:15,000
you know, 20, 30 million dollars from a studio.

2769
04:13:15,000 --> 04:13:19,000
Yeah, that probably would have been like an eight hour long game with a bunch more stuff going on.

2770
04:13:19,000 --> 04:13:24,000
But that was an independent game.

2771
04:13:24,000 --> 04:13:26,000
Yeah, I think I'm going to I'm going to take off.

2772
04:13:26,000 --> 04:13:27,000
I'm starving.

2773
04:13:27,000 --> 04:13:30,000
I was hungry when I started the stream even like two or three hours into the stream.

2774
04:13:30,000 --> 04:13:34,000
I'm like, I'm like, I'm like really, really, really, really,

2775
04:13:34,000 --> 04:13:36,000
let me just get to the right page here.

2776
04:13:36,000 --> 04:13:44,000
I'm going to see I'm going to tear out some of these pages.

2777
04:13:44,000 --> 04:13:51,000
Yes, you guys want to like see here's like one of the pages.

2778
04:13:51,000 --> 04:13:57,000
Actually, can we see if I can even turn on my webcam?

2779
04:13:57,000 --> 04:14:04,000
Is it even connected?

2780
04:14:05,000 --> 04:14:11,000
Let's see.

2781
04:14:17,000 --> 04:14:19,000
Okay, did it work?

2782
04:14:19,000 --> 04:14:21,000
So here's the page.

2783
04:14:21,000 --> 04:14:22,000
Here's a page you want to see.

2784
04:14:22,000 --> 04:14:24,000
Can we over here?

2785
04:14:24,000 --> 04:14:29,000
Hey, look at server to family hope.

2786
04:14:29,000 --> 04:14:30,000
I remember these symbols.

2787
04:14:30,000 --> 04:14:34,000
If we're going to write those down.

2788
04:14:34,000 --> 04:14:35,000
There you go.

2789
04:14:35,000 --> 04:14:42,000
This is one of my notebook pages.

2790
04:14:49,000 --> 04:14:57,000
It was before that anyway.

2791
04:14:57,000 --> 04:15:03,000
There's all this stuff.

2792
04:15:03,000 --> 04:15:10,000
All right, guys.

2793
04:15:10,000 --> 04:15:13,000
Well, that's just one of the, I there was like five or four of the pages,

2794
04:15:13,000 --> 04:15:15,000
but we don't need to see those.

2795
04:15:15,000 --> 04:15:20,000
We're going to see my awful, awful handwriting.

2796
04:15:20,000 --> 04:15:23,000
But yeah, I'll talk to you guys later.

2797
04:15:23,000 --> 04:15:25,000
Take care.

2798
04:15:25,000 --> 04:15:27,000
Hope you enjoyed the stream.

2799
04:15:27,000 --> 04:15:30,000
I will be around probably the next couple days.

2800
04:15:30,000 --> 04:15:32,000
I'll probably stream something.

2801
04:15:32,000 --> 04:15:33,000
But yeah, I'm off.

2802
04:15:33,000 --> 04:15:35,000
Take it easy, guys.

2803
04:15:35,000 --> 04:15:36,000
Good night.

2804
04:15:36,000 --> 04:15:38,000
Thanks for stuck around the whole time.

2805
04:15:38,000 --> 04:15:39,000
Thanks.

2806
04:15:39,000 --> 04:15:40,000
Cool.

2807
04:15:40,000 --> 04:15:42,000
Yeah, I'm a crox on steam.

2808
04:15:42,000 --> 04:15:43,000
You can get it right now.

2809
04:15:43,000 --> 04:15:45,000
I believe it's 1999 or 2025.

2810
04:15:45,000 --> 04:15:46,000
I don't know.

2811
04:15:46,000 --> 04:15:47,000
It's something like that.

2812
04:15:47,000 --> 04:15:48,000
But yeah.

2813
04:15:48,000 --> 04:15:50,000
Take it easy, guys.

2814
04:15:50,000 --> 04:15:52,000
Thanks for coming.

2815
04:15:52,000 --> 04:15:53,000
Bye.

2816
04:15:53,000 --> 04:15:54,000
Bye, bye.

2817
04:15:54,000 --> 04:15:55,000
Good night.
