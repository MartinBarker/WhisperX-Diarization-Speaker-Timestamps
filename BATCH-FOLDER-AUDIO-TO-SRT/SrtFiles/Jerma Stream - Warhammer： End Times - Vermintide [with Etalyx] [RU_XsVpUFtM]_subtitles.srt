1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
But one last stop-long in the mark, Flats.

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:05,000
Alicia will meet you there.

3
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:08,000
Get moving. Beat the ratmen to it.

4
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:11,000
Ha-ha!

5
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:15,000
We're already in a game, I guess.

6
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:16,000
We're blessed.

7
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:17,000
Help!

8
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:20,000
Where are we?

9
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:21,000
Up here!

10
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:22,000
Whereup that way?

11
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:25,000
My ladies and gentlemen, welcome.

12
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:26,000
Just a moment.

13
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:29,000
To the New Year's Eve, Caltown Street!

14
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:33,000
Damn, they're definitely in this area.

15
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:40,000
Whoa, it was the drag.

16
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:45,000
It's got thrown into this game.

17
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:47,000
I don't even know what's happening.

18
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:49,000
All I know is I just got tossed in here.

19
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:52,000
I went to matchmaking and all of a sudden in somebody's game.

20
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:57,000
They're everywhere.

21
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:03,000
I'm going to go to the New Year's Eve.

22
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:09,000
Yeah, I would have done like a more proper intro, but...

23
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:11,000
It's got sucked in here.

24
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:13,000
Hi! Hi guys! Hello!

25
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:17,000
Welcome to my New Year's Eve, Caltown Street!

26
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:22,000
I wanted to do this, so that'll be fun to, like, Caltown the New Year.

27
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:23,000
At least East Coast.

28
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:25,000
Gatlin' Gunnar.

29
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:28,000
It's up here.

30
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:30,000
We're for East Coast.

31
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:33,000
This is Burmentide.

32
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:35,000
Burmentide.

33
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:37,000
Gunnar played it before.

34
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:39,000
It's kind of like Leffordead.

35
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:40,000
Holy shit.

36
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:42,000
No!

37
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:46,000
All right, if you ever played Leffordead,

38
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:48,000
it's Leffordead with rats.

39
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:51,000
That's pretty much all you need to know.

40
00:01:56,000 --> 00:02:00,000
Happy New Year to those of you that have had the New Year go by already.

41
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:11,000
Well, also, the East Coast still has quite a little bit of ways.

42
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:13,000
Like an hour or so till we can count accounts.

43
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:24,000
This game has pleasantly surprised me though.

44
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:29,000
I held off installing this game for, like, at least a month or two.

45
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:43,000
All right, yeah, get the star sub-sound out of your system.

46
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:46,000
Yeah, we all heard it.

47
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:48,000
It was really funny.

48
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:50,000
Star makes the funniest jokes, right?

49
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:54,000
And by funniest jokes, I mean, he just, like, insults me.

50
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:55,000
And that's it.

51
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:56,000
Good joke.

52
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:57,000
Good joke, Star.

53
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:59,000
Really good punchline.

54
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:11,000
I'm okay on health.

55
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:26,000
Let's double check the market.

56
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:31,000
And nobody wants to mention the fact that he didn't stream for a month.

57
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:36,000
No, no, it's all, it's all got to be about how Jerma sucks, right?

58
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:38,000
Oh shit.

59
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:41,000
He's a fucking joke, Star.

60
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:42,000
I'll tell you that.

61
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:45,000
I don't even want to play this character.

62
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:47,000
I don't play the dwarf guy.

63
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:52,000
This is somebody healing.

64
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:53,000
I've never seen this in a healer.

65
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:54,000
It's not easy.

66
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:55,000
I thought it was only normal or hard.

67
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:07,000
I don't know.

68
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:09,000
This is just going to stream vermitide for a while.

69
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:10,000
I think.

70
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:13,000
Oh dear.

71
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:31,000
Hey, what left for dead bodies this?

72
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:33,000
Alright, get it out of your system.

73
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:35,000
Go ahead, get it out of your system.

74
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:36,000
Let's hear it.

75
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:38,000
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

76
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:45,000
I knew I was just freaking out right there.

77
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:48,000
Oh, jeez!

78
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:51,000
Where the fuck did he come from?

79
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:52,000
What the fuck?

80
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:53,000
Oh my god.

81
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:56,000
I'm just stuck up here.

82
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:57,000
I don't want to jump out there.

83
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:58,000
Bye bye.

84
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:00,000
Holy shit, I'm still alive.

85
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:04,000
Geez.

86
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:22,000
Oh, what the fuck an assassin rat?

87
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:28,000
No, I don't want to do that.

88
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:34,000
We gotta hit this big motherfucker out of here.

89
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:36,000
Yeah.

90
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:42,000
I like this arrow because it bounces around everybody.

91
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:50,000
Can I hit him right in his face?

92
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:51,000
Whoa.

93
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:54,000
We have a decade of uninterrupted practice.

94
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:56,000
No, not even there.

95
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:00,000
You know, I could address.

96
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:01,000
I want to.

97
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:02,000
I want to.

98
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:04,000
I've been very silent about it.

99
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:05,000
I've been very quiet about it.

100
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:06,000
Because I have to be.

101
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:11,000
Everybody wants to talk about Derma wrestling.

102
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:14,000
And God, guys, me too.

103
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:15,000
I really do.

104
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:17,000
But I can't.

105
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:18,000
I just can't.

106
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:23,000
Jess, Jess, be patient.

107
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:26,000
That's all I can say is it's not going to happen in 2015.

108
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:29,000
You just got to be patient.

109
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:30,000
You got to trust me on this one.

110
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:31,000
Yeah, you got to trust me.

111
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:32,000
Be patient.

112
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:35,000
And your patients will pay off.

113
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:36,000
I hope.

114
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:38,000
Maybe.

115
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:41,000
Do we have any like tubes, really?

116
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:46,000
This is called vermin tide.

117
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:47,000
That is correct.

118
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:48,000
I need a movement.

119
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:49,000
Mike, I'm not liking it.

120
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:50,000
Oh, somebody got a loop.

121
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:51,000
Sorry.

122
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:52,000
This is going to make a little bit of noise.

123
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:54,000
Hopefully it's not too loud when I move this around.

124
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:56,000
I'll put on a jump.

125
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:57,000
I'll put on a jump on.

126
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:59,000
Look at the spate of the.

127
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:02,000
Only grimness all right.

128
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:05,000
The scale can turn this time.

129
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:07,000
This isn't going well.

130
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:09,000
But this is I like this game a lot.

131
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:14,000
This this game sort of flew a little bit under the radar.

132
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:17,000
It wasn't one of those games that a bunch of people were talking about.

133
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:20,000
I think people were talking about it.

134
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:22,000
But it's just fun to play.

135
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:23,000
Fine shot.

136
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:26,000
How did I know it hit him?

137
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:31,000
It's good just to walk around and slash a bunch of rats, you know?

138
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:40,000
Are we going to move?

139
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:46,000
I would say if you really want to know when when Jerma rumble four is coming out.

140
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:51,000
The only thing I can tell you is probably spring 2016.

141
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:59,000
Very very I don't know but like it'll it'll trust me when I say that it'll hopefully it's worth it.

142
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:01,000
I hope it's fucking worth it.

143
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:11,000
It is a Warhammer game.

144
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:12,000
It is the war who are end times.

145
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:27,000
What let him know what level of my we are right now.

146
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:29,000
I've only not completed one.

147
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:32,000
I didn't beat the last campaign yet.

148
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:34,000
Oh shit that's not good.

149
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:42,000
Where they coming from?

150
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:46,000
Ooh that was a double.

151
00:08:54,000 --> 00:09:01,000
I'm not very go with this character because it's not going to hit headshots with the bow.

152
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:03,000
This is very quick.

153
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:06,000
But this is actually balanced around arrow.

154
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:07,000
I really like.

155
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:11,000
I'll show you guys my items when I get a second after the start.

156
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:16,000
When I get a moment or two.

157
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:28,000
What characters are there in this game?

158
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:30,000
There's five classes.

159
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:40,000
There are five.

160
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:41,000
What the.

161
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:42,000
Flying fuck.

162
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:45,000
These.

163
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:47,000
Why was he shooting me?

164
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:55,000
Get away.

165
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:00,000
I am in deep shit.

166
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:01,000
I gotta stay back.

167
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:06,000
I'm going to stay away back.

168
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:11,000
Another Gatlin gunner rat?

169
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:12,000
You serious?

170
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:22,000
He's still alive?

171
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:25,000
Oh my god.

172
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:26,000
Oh god this is not good.

173
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:27,000
This is not good.

174
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:30,000
The gas rat is just fucking this all up.

175
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:34,000
No why is the gunner going that way?

176
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:35,000
Go that way.

177
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:36,000
Thank god.

178
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:39,000
If I could touch three in a second I'm dead.

179
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:40,000
Oh boy.

180
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:41,000
Oh god.

181
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:44,000
I think this might be done deal.

182
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:47,000
Maybe not.

183
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:52,000
Oh I'm alive.

184
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:55,000
I actually haven't played TF2.

185
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:57,000
I haven't played the tough break.

186
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:58,000
Campaign stuff.

187
00:10:58,000 --> 00:10:59,000
It's been fun.

188
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:03,000
I don't know if I'll stream that tonight but.

189
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:08,000
In all seriousness is this game is supposed to be this similar to Left 4 Dead?

190
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:09,000
Ah yes.

191
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:21,000
I would say that this is as close to Left 4 Dead 3 as you could possibly get without it being Left 4 Dead 3.

192
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:27,000
Like take Left 4 Dead and rewind it into Medieval times with some magic shit.

193
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:28,000
It is Left 4 Dead.

194
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:35,000
But it has an item system which you like kind of craft items you roll for items and it is.

195
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:37,000
We'll see.

196
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:40,000
Is it bravery or stupidity that pushes you or does it?

197
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:41,000
I really could use that.

198
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:44,000
And so could you but I grabbed it first so I'm drinking it.

199
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:54,000
Uh oh.

200
00:11:58,000 --> 00:11:59,000
Uh oh.

201
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:02,000
It's getting grabbed by a stick rat.

202
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:04,000
I don't close me out of here.

203
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:06,000
What the hell?

204
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:09,000
How much is it cost?

205
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:13,000
I think it is currently on sale for 15% off.

206
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:16,000
I think it's $25 or whatever your.

207
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:20,000
Whatever $25 is for you or whatever it is.

208
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:29,000
I wish I was the voice for the rats in this game though.

209
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:31,000
It would be awesome.

210
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:34,000
I would love to be the rats.

211
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:37,000
Uh, is there any, yeah.

212
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:39,000
Give that to the cast or yeah.

213
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:40,000
You drink that.

214
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:43,000
Mm, yummy, yummy.

215
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:44,000
What time is it?

216
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:46,000
It is like 11.30?

217
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:47,000
11.40?

218
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:49,000
We're gonna count down the new year guys.

219
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:51,000
We're gonna count down the new year guys.

220
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:53,000
We're gonna count down the new year.

221
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:55,000
We're gonna do a big count.

222
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:57,000
I'm gonna put a big countdown on screen and shit.

223
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:58,000
It's gonna be awesome.

224
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:02,000
I got a party hat specifically to do it.

225
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:04,000
I got one of those like.

226
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:07,000
Those things you blow into.

227
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:08,000
A whistle, a horn.

228
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:09,000
A horn whistle.

229
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:16,000
It's safe to say this game is fun.

230
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:19,000
Yes, if you like the left for dead formula,

231
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:23,000
there is no reason why you would not like this game.

232
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:29,000
If you get a couple of your buddies and you jump in and you play and you guys all enjoy the left for dead formula,

233
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:32,000
there's almost no differences.

234
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:34,000
Besides the fact that it is melee,

235
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:39,000
predominantly a melee only game with side arms and bows.

236
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:45,000
Medical supplies.

237
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:47,000
What are you living in a barn?

238
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:55,000
I think we might defend this room for a minute.

239
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:58,000
Are we just gonna defend this area?

240
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:00,000
I must heal!

241
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:01,000
Jeremiah bought your glue man shirt.

242
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:02,000
Do you love me yet?

243
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:04,000
Of course I do.

244
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:05,000
Come on.

245
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:08,000
You even have to ask that question?

246
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:14,000
This is a very tense music for nothing really happening.

247
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:17,000
Watch out, watch out for the one rat.

248
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:22,000
What the hell are they?

249
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:28,000
What is going on here?

250
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:30,000
Are they all coming in this door?

251
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:31,000
I guess so.

252
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:33,000
I guess they're coming in the front door.

253
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:35,000
What about you idiots?

254
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:37,000
You could have flanked us.

255
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:39,000
You could have hit us.

256
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:44,000
Auto update.

257
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:45,000
I have an auto update.

258
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:49,000
Those are the ones that have been following my Twitter.

259
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:52,000
These last week there's two.

260
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:55,000
Counterins are like a little bit of nightmare situation with my dog,

261
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:57,000
for those of you that don't know.

262
00:14:57,000 --> 00:15:00,000
Oh man, I PWM some rats.

263
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:04,000
He has Addison's disease.

264
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:07,000
Just got diagnosed like this past week.

265
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:12,000
I was in the vet for pretty much every single day straight last week.

266
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:16,000
He was getting blood work done, he was getting test done,

267
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:18,000
and all kinds of awful shit.

268
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:23,000
And it turns out he needs to go on Fredna's own steroids for the rest of his life.

269
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:30,000
And I have to give him a little squeeze out of this little syringe thing

270
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:33,000
into his mouth every day.

271
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:36,000
And I have to do that for the rest of his whole life.

272
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:41,000
But the upside is he is perfectly fine.

273
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:48,000
He has done a complete 180 from being all sorts of fucked up to be in the dog.

274
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:50,000
I know I'm a dog.

275
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:51,000
He is just auto.

276
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:52,000
He's back to normal.

277
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:56,000
Completely like almost 100% back to normal after doing the treatment.

278
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:57,000
So that's that.

279
00:15:57,000 --> 00:15:58,000
That's a thing.

280
00:15:58,000 --> 00:15:59,000
He's okay.

281
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:05,000
If I could show him on camera here in a minute, I really want to.

282
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:12,000
Yeah, when we do the big countdown, I'll show auto on screen.

283
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:23,000
Oh dear, that's a big donor guy.

284
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:28,000
I like and don't like this character.

285
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:34,000
Don't get split up.

286
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:40,000
Yeah, the doctor actually told me that with Addison's disease for dogs.

287
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:45,000
If you have a dog that is in very high stress environment, he can get all messed up.

288
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:50,000
Like if he had fun, he'd like thunderstorms dogs, they'd like run under the bed during a thunderstorm.

289
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:57,000
If he is that type of dog, apparently he can have all kinds of problems because he can't produce cortisol.

290
00:16:57,000 --> 00:17:03,000
So the doctor's like, make sure you don't put him in any stressful situations and put a fucking kill.

291
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:06,000
Well, he didn't say that, but you know, that's what I took from it.

292
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:07,000
And there's a tank following us.

293
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:14,000
This is not a good opportunity to get a tank.

294
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:15,000
Where is he?

295
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:17,000
He appeared in my face last time.

296
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:21,000
Hopefully it does not do it again.

297
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:24,000
Oh, where is he?

298
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:25,000
I don't know.

299
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:28,000
I'm gonna pick up this egg sack.

300
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:31,000
Protect me.

301
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:32,000
Come on.

302
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:33,000
I need some protection here.

303
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:40,000
I'm picking up the fucking egg sacks.

304
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:41,000
Here we go.

305
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:42,000
Keep going.

306
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:43,000
Keep going.

307
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:45,000
Let them just deal with the tank.

308
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:46,000
I got to protect you.

309
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:47,000
You're gonna.

310
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:48,000
I have this.

311
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:56,000
I'm gonna drop one and you drop one.

312
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:57,000
Oh boy.

313
00:17:57,000 --> 00:17:59,000
Don't look back.

314
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:01,000
He's not behind us.

315
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:04,000
I promise.

316
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:07,000
I can't do it a hell of a job.

317
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:09,000
He's still alive.

318
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:11,000
I'm gonna heal this guy too.

319
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:15,000
Once we get done with this other one.

320
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:17,000
I'm gonna get him.

321
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:18,000
Come over here.

322
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:19,000
Hey, you ready?

323
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:20,000
Come here.

324
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:23,000
Can I get it?

325
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:25,000
Oh, that was...

326
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:28,000
I guess that was not the guy I wanted to be.

327
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:29,000
I thought that was me.

328
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:30,000
No, it wasn't.

329
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:32,000
It was on her shit.

330
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:38,000
That's what I look at me.

331
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:41,000
No.

332
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:44,000
Where's the pack?

333
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:46,000
Where's the pack, Rhett?

334
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:49,000
I got you.

335
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:52,000
Oh, you're in such a bad spot, dude.

336
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:56,000
We're gonna have to get you later.

337
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:58,000
Can I get him?

338
00:18:58,000 --> 00:18:59,000
Wait, what?

339
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:00,000
Oh, God.

340
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:02,000
Don't.

341
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:07,000
Those bad news.

342
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:09,000
This is really bad news.

343
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:10,000
Yeah.

344
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:12,000
You bring him back to life.

345
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:13,000
Holy shit.

346
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:14,000
That guy caught me out of mid-air.

347
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:22,000
He got me in mid-fucking air.

348
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:24,000
Have I had me docked to Oakers lately?

349
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:28,000
I have it all the time.

350
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:35,000
That rat is freaking out now, boy.

351
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:36,000
At least we killed the tank, right?

352
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:39,000
Did we kill the tank?

353
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:41,000
There's still an assassin rat.

354
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:43,000
There he is.

355
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:44,000
Shit.

356
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:45,000
Don't let him wrap around us.

357
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:46,000
Stay together.

358
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:47,000
Stay together.

359
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:48,000
Stay together.

360
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:50,000
Those winds won't close by themselves.

361
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:52,000
That guy's got a healing drone.

362
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:53,000
He's just drinking.

363
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:58,000
Drink that shit, dude.

364
00:19:58,000 --> 00:20:05,000
Drink that shit.

365
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:06,000
There's only two more sacks.

366
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:07,000
You gotta go two by two.

367
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:08,000
You know what?

368
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:09,000
We should just do four by four then.

369
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:10,000
I'm not going over there by myself.

370
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:19,000
That's a fucking terrible idea.

371
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:20,000
Don't go over there by yourself.

372
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:21,000
Don't go by yourself.

373
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:22,000
Oh boy.

374
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:30,000
Well, I have to come with you now.

375
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:31,000
Oh, God.

376
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:34,000
Dude, I'm just distracting these dudes.

377
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:44,000
Hopefully you pick up that cereal bag and get it in here.

378
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:47,000
We're just kind of getting thrown into this game, like halfway through it.

379
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:48,000
Oh, never mind.

380
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:50,000
I spoke too soon.

381
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:52,000
There is no friendly fire.

382
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:55,000
Friendly fire does not exist in this game.

383
00:20:55,000 --> 00:21:00,000
Which is good because that would kind of be outrageous.

384
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:02,000
It'd be hard to, uh,

385
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:05,000
because everyone's like throwing their hands around spamming.

386
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:16,000
Let's get out of here.

387
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:19,000
Dermot or anyone in jail running out of nicknames, Hokie Monk.

388
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:23,000
Any ideas?

389
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:24,000
Ultradon.

390
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:28,000
That's a pretty good name.

391
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:33,000
I'm thinking Ultradon or...

392
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:34,000
Dread...

393
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:35,000
Dread...

394
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:36,000
Dread...

395
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:37,000
Dread...

396
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:38,000
Dread...

397
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:40,000
Jim...

398
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:45,000
Ernest.

399
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:55,000
We got a couple of bonus die.

400
00:21:55,000 --> 00:22:01,000
Alright, so to explain this in as tiny of a way as I possibly can.

401
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:02,000
You get dice.

402
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:06,000
All you have to do is you have to roll one face.

403
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:08,000
This doesn't have a symbols matter.

404
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:10,000
You just have to roll a face up.

405
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:14,000
So the amount of face upside roll, I get either a common or an uncommon.

406
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:16,000
I did it for me, but okay, here we go.

407
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:18,000
So that's 1, 2, 3, 4.

408
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:19,000
So that's 1, 2, 3, 4.

409
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:22,000
I got a green bow.

410
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:24,000
And...

411
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:28,000
Actually, I'm kind of curious what this is.

412
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:31,000
Black Mellow Bow Longbow.

413
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:37,000
And the upgrade is increased zoom distance.

414
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:40,000
Ha ha!

415
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:42,000
Give me a second.

416
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:44,000
I need to see...

417
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:45,000
Where...

418
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:47,000
Guys, we are...

419
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:50,000
Just about 20 minutes away from New Year's Day.

420
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:55,000
The big New Year 2016, going to count it down.

421
00:22:55,000 --> 00:22:57,000
Just about 20 minutes away.

422
00:22:57,000 --> 00:23:00,000
For the big countdown.

423
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:10,000
Alright, let's see.

424
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:13,000
Ah, wow, yeah.

425
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:15,000
So there are...

426
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:17,000
Exactly the same.

427
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:23,000
I think this bow does not have the homing trail.

428
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:28,000
So the only difference is this is just a longbow.

429
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:31,000
They are identical in stats.

430
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:33,000
This one has homing.

431
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:38,000
This one does not, but it has hires that I can like see, like, a zoom distance.

432
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:41,000
Let's just look at it.

433
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:42,000
Yeah, there we go.

434
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:44,000
So it just zooms in farther.

435
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:45,000
I'm not even upgraded.

436
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:47,000
I can upgrade and get even further.

437
00:23:47,000 --> 00:23:49,000
I...

438
00:23:49,000 --> 00:23:59,000
You kind of can get screwed sometimes when the homing arrow wants to just go wherever it wants.

439
00:23:59,000 --> 00:24:01,000
It's still fun to...

440
00:24:01,000 --> 00:24:02,000
How many bolts?

441
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:03,000
Arrows.

442
00:24:03,000 --> 00:24:05,000
This has more arrows too.

443
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:07,000
This has 40 plus arrows.

444
00:24:07,000 --> 00:24:09,000
That alone has 29, I think, right?

445
00:24:09,000 --> 00:24:10,000
Let's see.

446
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:12,000
I think so.

447
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:16,000
29, so yeah, I lose like 20, just about like 15 hours or 18 hours or something, but...

448
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:19,000
Oh, something about the homing is cool.

449
00:24:19,000 --> 00:24:24,000
I could salvage some shit.

450
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:25,000
Hmm.

451
00:24:25,000 --> 00:24:28,000
I don't like this.

452
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:30,000
We're gonna get rid of it.

453
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:35,000
And we're gonna get rid of this.

454
00:24:35,000 --> 00:24:36,000
28...

455
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:40,000
Yeah, I can make another...

456
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:44,000
Common, but I don't think I want to.

457
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:46,000
Have I decided on my game of the year 2015?

458
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:49,000
Of course I have Bloodborne.

459
00:24:49,000 --> 00:24:52,000
Of course I have Bloodborne for sure.

460
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:53,000
Although, I don't know.

461
00:24:53,000 --> 00:24:54,000
It's a toss-up.

462
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:59,000
I might need to like hold my own award ceremony to figure that out.

463
00:24:59,000 --> 00:25:00,000
Let's see.

464
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:03,000
Let's see what the academy thinks.

465
00:25:11,000 --> 00:25:14,000
Maybe I should just craft something.

466
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:15,000
I don't want this.

467
00:25:15,000 --> 00:25:16,000
I'm gonna craft.

468
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:17,000
Fucking craft it.

469
00:25:17,000 --> 00:25:22,000
Now I'm gonna use the gems to make...

470
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:24,000
What do I want to make?

471
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:25,000
What character do I want?

472
00:25:25,000 --> 00:25:28,000
I want to make something for.

473
00:25:31,000 --> 00:25:32,000
Let's go with...

474
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:34,000
I like the dwarf.

475
00:25:35,000 --> 00:25:37,000
Ah.

476
00:25:37,000 --> 00:25:40,000
I was gonna have to go with it.

477
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:41,000
Whatever.

478
00:25:41,000 --> 00:25:42,000
Let's see.

479
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:43,000
All right.

480
00:25:43,000 --> 00:25:45,000
What am I gonna get?

481
00:25:45,000 --> 00:25:46,000
Sword in the shield.

482
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:49,000
Or Axon shield.

483
00:25:49,000 --> 00:25:52,000
I played the dwarf.

484
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:54,000
Who is Rock?

485
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:56,000
Got it.

486
00:25:56,000 --> 00:25:58,000
So I currently have a blue.

487
00:25:58,000 --> 00:25:59,000
I did this.

488
00:25:59,000 --> 00:26:01,000
Which is pretty good.

489
00:26:01,000 --> 00:26:03,000
This is what I just got.

490
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:10,000
Sometimes it's fun to be shielded, guy.

491
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:18,000
What's the upgrade on it?

492
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:25,000
When hitting a man-sized enemy with a normal attack, there is a 5-15% chance to instantly kill it.

493
00:26:25,000 --> 00:26:28,000
What does that mean?

494
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:32,000
Oh, thanks to all the subscribers, by the way, all the old and new ones.

495
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:37,000
I haven't streamed in a while, so thanks.

496
00:26:37,000 --> 00:26:42,000
So a normal man-sized enemy is everybody a man-sized enemy compared to me.

497
00:26:58,000 --> 00:27:00,000
I kinda like it.

498
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:03,000
I'll just, I'll try it.

499
00:27:03,000 --> 00:27:09,000
I'm gonna upgrade it there.

500
00:27:09,000 --> 00:27:11,000
I got the absolute worst I could.

501
00:27:11,000 --> 00:27:15,000
I got the absolute bottom.

502
00:27:15,000 --> 00:27:18,000
That could have been 5-15.

503
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:20,000
And I got 5.

504
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:27,000
By the way, if you're wondering what like that noise in the background is, that's my heater in this room.

505
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:33,000
Oh, it's talking about the special rats, like the bigger ones.

506
00:27:33,000 --> 00:27:35,000
Oh, that's kind of cool.

507
00:27:35,000 --> 00:27:36,000
Which is what it wasn't.

508
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:39,000
5% kind of sucks.

509
00:27:39,000 --> 00:27:42,000
Are we doing another mission with these same dudes?

510
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:45,000
What's going on? Let's do it.

511
00:27:45,000 --> 00:27:47,000
Oh, wait, no, this buddy.

512
00:27:47,000 --> 00:27:50,000
That's fine.

513
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:54,000
It's my trusty shotgun.

514
00:27:54,000 --> 00:27:59,000
Even though it just sucks, it's a regular shitty shotgun.

515
00:28:01,000 --> 00:28:06,000
I wanna get a legendary orange item in the game.

516
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:17,000
Oh, cool.

517
00:28:25,000 --> 00:28:27,000
Is it...

518
00:28:27,000 --> 00:28:29,000
Those are players last year played this game.

519
00:28:29,000 --> 00:28:32,000
Is has anybody has...

520
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:33,000
A...

521
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:35,000
Orange item.

522
00:28:35,000 --> 00:28:36,000
And if you do...

523
00:28:37,000 --> 00:28:41,000
Is there any real big difference between the orange and non-Orange?

524
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:53,000
Not like having this shield though. You feel more involved when you're using a shield like this.

525
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:03,000
A...

526
00:29:05,000 --> 00:29:06,000
A...

527
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:07,000
A...

528
00:29:07,000 --> 00:29:08,000
A...

529
00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:09,000
A...

530
00:29:09,000 --> 00:29:10,000
A...

531
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:11,000
A...

532
00:29:11,000 --> 00:29:12,000
A...

533
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:13,000
A...

534
00:29:13,000 --> 00:29:14,000
A...

535
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:15,000
A...

536
00:29:15,000 --> 00:29:16,000
A...

537
00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:17,000
A...

538
00:29:17,000 --> 00:29:18,000
A...

539
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:19,000
A...

540
00:29:19,000 --> 00:29:20,000
A...

541
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:21,000
A...

542
00:29:21,000 --> 00:29:28,000
So here's my axe. This is the blue axe I have. It's a two-hander and it's big and it's a big swing.

543
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:29,000
A...

544
00:29:29,000 --> 00:29:30,000
A...

545
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:31,000
A...

546
00:29:31,000 --> 00:29:32,000
A...

547
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:33,000
A...

548
00:29:33,000 --> 00:29:34,000
A...

549
00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:35,000
A...

550
00:29:35,000 --> 00:29:36,000
A...

551
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:37,000
A...

552
00:29:37,000 --> 00:29:39,000
Giant rats.

553
00:29:39,000 --> 00:29:42,000
The orange items are a lot better. I just... I want to see one.

554
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:45,000
I want to hold one. I just want to hold it.

555
00:29:45,000 --> 00:29:46,000
I just want to hold it.

556
00:29:46,000 --> 00:29:53,000
I just want to hold the damper.

557
00:29:53,000 --> 00:29:55,000
Here we go.

558
00:29:55,000 --> 00:29:56,000
I am...

559
00:29:56,000 --> 00:29:59,000
Am I ready? All right. What do you guys think?

560
00:29:59,000 --> 00:30:04,000
Big blue two-hander or...

561
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:09,000
Sword and Shield Protect teammates guy.

562
00:30:09,000 --> 00:30:11,000
I don't like this.

563
00:30:11,000 --> 00:30:14,000
That means this is how many people you can hit with a swing.

564
00:30:14,000 --> 00:30:17,000
That needs to be...

565
00:30:17,000 --> 00:30:19,000
That's so much bigger. What is this? Is this a one-hander?

566
00:30:19,000 --> 00:30:24,000
One-hander?

567
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:31,000
I don't know. I guess I'll use the shield.

568
00:30:31,000 --> 00:30:39,000
Five-four-three-two-one.

569
00:30:39,000 --> 00:30:43,000
Zero.

570
00:30:43,000 --> 00:30:45,000
Prepare your shield.

571
00:30:45,000 --> 00:30:52,000
They've agreed to bring supplies in through the sewers on the condition that I provide a way in.

572
00:30:52,000 --> 00:30:55,000
Yes, there's more scabin' of mouth.

573
00:30:55,000 --> 00:30:57,000
You cannot change your weapon mid-mission. No.

574
00:30:57,000 --> 00:30:58,000
I can't change that.

575
00:30:58,000 --> 00:31:00,000
You cannot change your class or your weapon.

576
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:03,000
The only time you can change is right at the very beginning.

577
00:31:03,000 --> 00:31:05,000
There is an inventory.

578
00:31:05,000 --> 00:31:08,000
Legitimately right when we start the game right here.

579
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:11,000
But other than that, nope.

580
00:31:15,000 --> 00:31:18,000
See right here?

581
00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:21,000
Hmm, I can change my stuff.

582
00:31:21,000 --> 00:31:24,000
But I'll stay with this.

583
00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:30,000
These will do a humus good.

584
00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:32,000
I shouldn't have picked the shotgun.

585
00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:35,000
It's two close quarters.

586
00:31:35,000 --> 00:31:40,000
I'm coming.

587
00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:45,000
I'm coming.

588
00:31:45,000 --> 00:31:52,000
I'm coming.

589
00:31:52,000 --> 00:31:59,000
I'm coming.

590
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:03,000
Kind of just have to get in everybody's way.

591
00:32:03,000 --> 00:32:06,000
This character.

592
00:32:06,000 --> 00:32:12,000
The shield, don'ts.

593
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:14,000
That one felt good.

594
00:32:14,000 --> 00:32:17,000
That had a lot of weight behind it.

595
00:32:17,000 --> 00:32:21,000
Oh, that's an assassin rat.

596
00:32:21,000 --> 00:32:23,000
He's still coming in.

597
00:32:23,000 --> 00:32:26,000
He got a time these stuns.

598
00:32:26,000 --> 00:32:33,000
He's not dead.

599
00:32:33,000 --> 00:32:38,000
I would be careful.

600
00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:43,000
The garros.

601
00:32:43,000 --> 00:32:45,000
Damn it.

602
00:32:45,000 --> 00:32:46,000
He's still alive.

603
00:32:46,000 --> 00:32:55,000
And now we're getting a horde.

604
00:32:55,000 --> 00:32:58,000
Bumps any more than one.

605
00:32:58,000 --> 00:33:01,000
Don't split up.

606
00:33:01,000 --> 00:33:04,000
Cut up in this maze of a sewer we have here.

607
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:07,000
That's a patrol of armored enemies.

608
00:33:07,000 --> 00:33:10,000
I don't want to see that at all.

609
00:33:10,000 --> 00:33:15,000
There's a lot of healing in here.

610
00:33:16,000 --> 00:33:22,000
You want the fuckers?

611
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:30,000
Someone's blood on my screen.

612
00:33:30,000 --> 00:33:32,000
I can't see it.

613
00:33:32,000 --> 00:33:39,000
It's like water.

614
00:33:40,000 --> 00:33:46,000
Oh, fuckers.

615
00:33:46,000 --> 00:33:53,000
Oh, god.

616
00:33:53,000 --> 00:33:57,000
What a perfectly timed bomb that was.

617
00:33:57,000 --> 00:34:00,000
Good work, dude.

618
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:03,000
I got saved by ass.

619
00:34:03,000 --> 00:34:08,000
They could break through my shield.

620
00:34:10,000 --> 00:34:16,000
Let's go.

621
00:34:16,000 --> 00:34:23,000
The vermin talk.

622
00:34:23,000 --> 00:34:27,000
Oh, fuck.

623
00:34:27,000 --> 00:34:30,000
Am I too little to jump this?

624
00:34:30,000 --> 00:34:36,000
My little body can't jump over that.

625
00:34:36,000 --> 00:34:42,000
I can't see it.

626
00:34:42,000 --> 00:34:46,000
I can't see it.

627
00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:54,000
I can't see it.

628
00:34:54,000 --> 00:35:01,000
I can't see it.

629
00:35:01,000 --> 00:35:07,000
I can't see it.

630
00:35:07,000 --> 00:35:13,000
I can't see it.

631
00:35:13,000 --> 00:35:19,000
I can't see it.

632
00:35:19,000 --> 00:35:26,000
I can't see it.

633
00:35:27,000 --> 00:35:35,000
That's so far so good.

634
00:35:35,000 --> 00:35:44,000
There's the thing to spin the thing.

635
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:51,000
Open the floor, Jets.

636
00:35:52,000 --> 00:35:57,000
He said it.

637
00:35:57,000 --> 00:36:04,000
He said it.

638
00:36:04,000 --> 00:36:20,000
There comes the race.

639
00:36:20,000 --> 00:36:26,000
I can't see it.

640
00:36:26,000 --> 00:36:33,000
I can't see it.

641
00:36:33,000 --> 00:36:40,000
I can't see it.

642
00:36:40,000 --> 00:36:45,000
I can't see it.

643
00:36:45,000 --> 00:36:51,000
I can't see it.

644
00:36:51,000 --> 00:36:57,000
Just a pile of rats.

645
00:36:57,000 --> 00:37:07,000
I didn't get the shield up.

646
00:37:07,000 --> 00:37:13,000
I can't see it.

647
00:37:13,000 --> 00:37:19,000
I can't see it.

648
00:37:19,000 --> 00:37:24,000
The FOB is a little strange in this game.

649
00:37:24,000 --> 00:37:30,000
At 90 it feels kind of odd.

650
00:37:30,000 --> 00:37:35,000
I have it set to 85 right now just because I get a ton of

651
00:37:36,000 --> 00:37:41,000
I can't see it.

652
00:37:41,000 --> 00:37:47,000
Somebody kill him.

653
00:37:47,000 --> 00:37:53,000
Somebody kill him.

654
00:37:53,000 --> 00:37:59,000
I think he's still alive.

655
00:38:00,000 --> 00:38:05,000
I don't know.

656
00:38:05,000 --> 00:38:11,000
Especially when you're turning corners.

657
00:38:11,000 --> 00:38:18,000
I'll keep it at 90.

658
00:38:18,000 --> 00:38:25,000
I don't know what it is about this game's 90 FOB.

659
00:38:25,000 --> 00:38:31,000
Oh my god.

660
00:38:31,000 --> 00:38:37,000
I know I have to heal.

661
00:38:37,000 --> 00:38:43,000
Somebody hits.

662
00:38:43,000 --> 00:38:49,000
You're just weird.

663
00:38:49,000 --> 00:38:54,000
I already know that.

664
00:38:54,000 --> 00:39:00,000
I can't see it.

665
00:39:00,000 --> 00:39:06,000
I can't see it.

666
00:39:06,000 --> 00:39:13,000
I can't see it.

667
00:39:13,000 --> 00:39:19,000
I can't see it.

668
00:39:19,000 --> 00:39:25,000
I can't see it.

669
00:39:25,000 --> 00:39:31,000
I can't see it.

670
00:39:31,000 --> 00:39:38,000
I can't see it.

671
00:39:38,000 --> 00:39:45,000
I can't see it.

672
00:39:46,000 --> 00:39:51,000
Guys, we are less than 10 minutes away.

673
00:39:51,000 --> 00:39:57,000
We are less than 10 minutes away from the new year countdown.

674
00:39:57,000 --> 00:40:03,000
I can't see it.

675
00:40:03,000 --> 00:40:09,000
I can't see it.

676
00:40:09,000 --> 00:40:15,000
I can't see it.

677
00:40:15,000 --> 00:40:21,000
He ran that way down the hall.

678
00:40:22,000 --> 00:40:28,000
Damn it.

679
00:40:28,000 --> 00:40:34,000
You're a driven man, Salt's Pire.

680
00:40:34,000 --> 00:40:40,000
See that you don't interfere.

681
00:40:40,000 --> 00:40:47,000
Oh shit.

682
00:40:47,000 --> 00:40:57,000
I can't see it.

683
00:40:57,000 --> 00:41:01,000
I already killed this guy.

684
00:41:01,000 --> 00:41:07,000
Nope.

685
00:41:07,000 --> 00:41:11,000
The assassin was still alive, wasn't he?

686
00:41:11,000 --> 00:41:21,000
I already have a potion.

687
00:41:21,000 --> 00:41:25,000
I just started using them more often.

688
00:41:25,000 --> 00:41:32,000
I just don't.

689
00:41:32,000 --> 00:41:38,000
Oh, free stuff.

690
00:41:38,000 --> 00:41:44,000
I can't see it.

691
00:41:44,000 --> 00:41:51,000
I can't see it.

692
00:41:51,000 --> 00:41:58,000
I can't see it.

693
00:41:58,000 --> 00:42:04,000
I can't see it.

694
00:42:04,000 --> 00:42:11,000
Let's do it.

695
00:42:11,000 --> 00:42:18,000
Open the second floodgate.

696
00:42:18,000 --> 00:42:30,000
Get off me.

697
00:42:30,000 --> 00:42:33,000
What's going on?

698
00:42:33,000 --> 00:42:36,000
I'm not the gate, man.

699
00:42:36,000 --> 00:42:43,000
You got a gate to open.

700
00:42:43,000 --> 00:42:46,000
Oh, there we go.

701
00:42:46,000 --> 00:42:50,000
There's teammate number one.

702
00:42:50,000 --> 00:42:56,000
Let's open it.

703
00:42:56,000 --> 00:42:59,000
Pull it.

704
00:42:59,000 --> 00:43:02,000
Get it open.

705
00:43:02,000 --> 00:43:09,000
It's like that music starts to play.

706
00:43:09,000 --> 00:43:16,000
They go.

707
00:43:16,000 --> 00:43:25,000
They start landing.

708
00:43:25,000 --> 00:43:28,000
You guys.

709
00:43:28,000 --> 00:43:38,000
It's shit.

710
00:43:38,000 --> 00:43:46,000
Not that much further.

711
00:43:46,000 --> 00:44:01,000
It's dropping grenades everywhere.

712
00:44:01,000 --> 00:44:04,000
Let's get the hell out of here.

713
00:44:04,000 --> 00:44:09,000
Let's get the hell out of here.

714
00:44:09,000 --> 00:44:24,000
I'm going to go behind myself.

715
00:44:24,000 --> 00:44:33,000
Don't get jumped on.

716
00:44:33,000 --> 00:44:43,000
I'm going to go behind myself.

717
00:44:43,000 --> 00:44:52,000
That was a blind.

718
00:44:52,000 --> 00:44:56,000
That went away.

719
00:44:56,000 --> 00:45:02,000
Nothing no mood for this shit.

720
00:45:02,000 --> 00:45:05,000
Luke died.

721
00:45:05,000 --> 00:45:11,000
I mean to get the roll into the die.

722
00:45:11,000 --> 00:45:15,000
No, one person can only have one last per game.

723
00:45:15,000 --> 00:45:19,000
So they cannot be two dwarves.

724
00:45:19,000 --> 00:45:21,000
I'd like to keep.

725
00:45:21,000 --> 00:45:25,000
Let's get out of here.

726
00:45:25,000 --> 00:45:29,000
Let's go.

727
00:45:29,000 --> 00:45:34,000
Let's go.

728
00:45:34,000 --> 00:45:41,000
Let's go.

729
00:45:41,000 --> 00:45:47,000
Let's go.

730
00:45:47,000 --> 00:45:52,000
Let's go.

731
00:45:52,000 --> 00:45:58,000
Let's go.

732
00:45:58,000 --> 00:46:04,000
Let's go.

733
00:46:04,000 --> 00:46:07,000
Let's go.

734
00:46:07,000 --> 00:46:11,000
Let's get in the bus.

735
00:46:11,000 --> 00:46:14,000
All right.

736
00:46:14,000 --> 00:46:15,000
Let's move.

737
00:46:15,000 --> 00:46:16,000
That was a good run.

738
00:46:16,000 --> 00:46:21,000
We are victorious.

739
00:46:21,000 --> 00:46:26,000
We are victorious.

740
00:46:26,000 --> 00:46:31,000
We are victorious.

741
00:46:31,000 --> 00:46:35,000
We are victorious.

742
00:46:35,000 --> 00:46:39,000
I like that.

743
00:46:39,000 --> 00:46:46,000
I want to get that roll.

744
00:46:46,000 --> 00:46:53,000
I want to get that roll.

745
00:46:53,000 --> 00:46:57,000
The one thing I don't like about playing a shield character

746
00:46:57,000 --> 00:47:00,000
is you don't do a whole lot of damage.

747
00:47:00,000 --> 00:47:04,000
So you don't really get on the list anywhere.

748
00:47:04,000 --> 00:47:05,000
All right.

749
00:47:05,000 --> 00:47:07,000
I'm going to leave this game.

750
00:47:07,000 --> 00:47:10,000
Because we got a countdown to do.

751
00:47:10,000 --> 00:47:12,000
That is gentlemen.

752
00:47:13,000 --> 00:47:20,000
We're putting up the countdown.

753
00:47:20,000 --> 00:47:24,000
Give me back to the end.

754
00:47:24,000 --> 00:47:31,000
We're going to be watching that clock like a hawk.

755
00:47:31,000 --> 00:47:36,000
We're down to the last two minutes.

756
00:47:36,000 --> 00:47:37,000
All right.

757
00:47:37,000 --> 00:47:39,000
Let me go get my stuff.

758
00:47:39,000 --> 00:47:41,000
I got to get home on the second.

759
00:47:41,000 --> 00:47:44,000
I got to get the camera wrong.

760
00:47:44,000 --> 00:47:46,000
Make sure we get to get ready.

761
00:47:46,000 --> 00:47:49,000
I got to go get my stuff.

762
00:47:49,000 --> 00:47:53,000
Countdowns in one minute.

763
00:48:11,000 --> 00:48:16,000
I'm going to get the stuff.

764
00:48:16,000 --> 00:48:21,000
I'm going to get the stuff.

765
00:48:21,000 --> 00:48:26,000
I'm going to get the stuff.

766
00:48:26,000 --> 00:48:31,000
I'm going to get the stuff.

767
00:48:31,000 --> 00:48:36,000
I'm going to get the stuff.

00:48:36,000 --> 00:48:41,000
I'm going to get the stuff.

769
00:48:41,000 --> 00:48:46,000
I'm going to get the stuff.

770
00:48:46,000 --> 00:48:51,000
I'm going to get the stuff.

771
00:48:51,000 --> 00:48:56,000
I'm going to get the stuff.

772
00:48:56,000 --> 00:49:01,000
I'm going to get the stuff.

773
00:49:01,000 --> 00:49:06,000
I'm going to get the stuff.

774
00:49:06,000 --> 00:49:11,000
I'm going to get the stuff.

775
00:49:11,000 --> 00:49:16,000
I'm going to get the stuff.

776
00:49:16,000 --> 00:49:21,000
I'm going to get the stuff.

777
00:49:21,000 --> 00:49:26,000
I'm going to get the stuff.

778
00:49:26,000 --> 00:49:31,000
I'm going to get the stuff.

00:49:31,000 --> 00:49:36,000

00:51:31,000 --> 00:51:36,000

I'm going to get the stuff.

807
00:51:51,000 --> 00:51:56,000
I'm going to get the stuff.

808
00:51:56,000 --> 00:52:06,000
Eight, seven, six, five, four, three, two.

809
00:52:06,000 --> 00:52:07,000
Shh!

810
00:52:36,000 --> 00:52:48,000
I got my fucking new year robe for nothing.

811
00:52:48,000 --> 00:53:10,000
I bought this fucking bathroom. It's a special new year bathroom.

812
00:53:10,000 --> 00:53:13,000
Happy New Year everybody. Happy New Year.

813
00:53:13,000 --> 00:53:25,000
Hope 2016 is a good one. Let's play more vermin time. Have I just been at this

814
00:53:25,000 --> 00:53:40,000
loading screen the entire time? Why have I not loaded into the in? What is going on here?

815
00:53:43,000 --> 00:54:05,000
What time is it? Come on. Bloodborne thanks for stopping. Hey, the 2016. Let's hope

816
00:54:05,000 --> 00:54:11,000
it's a good one. Right everybody? Cheers. Let me turn off this heater. It's starting

817
00:54:11,000 --> 00:54:30,000
to like, swelter in here. All right, let me figure out. I think I'm fucking baby toy.

818
00:54:30,000 --> 00:54:44,000
Shut up. Shut up. You fucking baby cell phone. Now, okay, what's going on? I can have to

819
00:54:44,000 --> 00:54:55,000
like, and this process or something. Where's going on? My whole game is crashed. Holy crap.

820
00:54:55,000 --> 00:55:15,000
Okay. Well, let me just a second here. Does this reload the game? Whatever. I can reload it.

821
00:55:15,000 --> 00:55:39,000
It's fine. Why do you have bad reads in a baby toy? Because I have nieces and nephews

822
00:55:39,000 --> 00:55:55,000
that come over here and need something to play with.

823
00:55:55,000 --> 00:56:04,000
Happy New Year. Much love. Oh, wait, forgot. We forgot about the very important dog camp.

824
00:56:04,000 --> 00:56:15,000
I'll show you guys how to. He's over here. He's over here. We're going to freak show. Hold on.

825
00:56:15,000 --> 00:56:37,000
Hey, there's a dog. See, he's doing just fine. Hi, Otto. Otto. He's kind of sleeping over there.

826
00:56:37,000 --> 00:56:46,000
You kind of freaked out when I jumped up there. He's lying on his little bed. He's new. Yeah, bad.

827
00:56:46,000 --> 00:57:05,000
Eminem's beach party. You're right. What the fuck are you talking about? I don't want to play as

828
00:57:05,000 --> 00:57:13,000
I guess they'll play dwarf, but I think I want to be dwarf big axe man.

829
00:57:13,000 --> 00:57:36,000
I don't have enough to do that. Well, shit. I'm going to be this guy. I like this guy.

830
00:57:36,000 --> 00:57:44,000
He's fun. He's a big two-hander man. The gun I have for him is a very powerful single shot rifle.

831
00:57:44,000 --> 00:57:59,000
That takes a while to reload. This is a very strong pushes armor pen and it's very,

832
00:57:59,000 --> 00:58:05,000
very strong. The normal attacks do a lot of damage and hits a shit load of people when you charge it up.

833
00:58:06,000 --> 00:58:14,000
So let's play, right? Let's play to change my stream title. It's got to say 2016. Gonna be a good one.

834
00:58:14,000 --> 00:58:19,000
2016, come off. We can't wait. It's gonna be such a good one. New Year's resolution.

835
00:58:25,000 --> 00:58:31,000
There we go. 2016. Gonna be a good one. There we are.

836
00:58:35,000 --> 00:58:44,000
What mission do I want to do? I don't know. About...

837
00:58:44,000 --> 00:58:56,000
I'll try one on hard. Actually, I haven't even beaten it. I don't have one mission I haven't done.

838
00:58:56,000 --> 00:58:59,000
I don't know if I want to do that right now.

839
00:59:08,000 --> 00:59:11,000
Smugglers run the enemy below waterfront.

840
00:59:11,000 --> 00:59:25,000
The vengeance of war will try it on hard. I'm gonna get my ass kicked, put, you know, whatever, right?

841
00:59:25,000 --> 00:59:39,000
It's fine to game. So take that as a no. We can't join you. I mean, if you just, just queue up,

842
00:59:39,000 --> 00:59:44,000
queue up for engines of war on hard. It does not very many people play in the game right now.

843
00:59:44,000 --> 00:59:50,000
You know what I mean? Like, just if you're in the game right now, just queue up for that on hard.

844
00:59:50,000 --> 00:59:53,000
And if you're in the United States, I'm sure I'll meet up with you.

845
01:00:00,000 --> 01:00:08,000
Thanks for the sub shout out. Oh, Mr. Twig, man. Welcome to the new year. Welcome to the 2016 year.

846
01:00:10,000 --> 01:00:13,000
I'll only reset if you finish your bio. I'm never finishing my bio.

847
01:00:15,000 --> 01:00:20,000
It's never gonna happen. I don't want anyone to know who I was. I want it to come with a channel and just be like,

848
01:00:20,000 --> 01:00:25,000
you fuck is this guy? I'm gonna bring this bio and be like, fine, bye. It doesn't have a shit here.

849
01:00:30,000 --> 01:00:33,000
I can't even play M&Ms Beach party, guys.

850
01:00:35,000 --> 01:00:39,000
You want me to play M&Ms? You want me to play a game for the original Nintendo Wii?

851
01:00:40,000 --> 01:00:44,000
How am I supposed to hook that? I can't hook that shit up. I don't have that in here.

852
01:00:47,000 --> 01:00:50,000
I think I like broke that disk in half, by the way. I don't know where it is.

853
01:00:58,000 --> 01:01:02,000
Just give me somewhere to donate to you. Now unnecessary.

854
01:01:03,000 --> 01:01:06,000
Your subscription, or you already subscribed. That's...

855
01:01:07,000 --> 01:01:11,000
That's good enough for me. More than enough for me. So thank you.

856
01:01:13,000 --> 01:01:17,000
Don't worry about it. Are you watching the stream? Is this guy watching the stream? I wonder.

857
01:01:18,000 --> 01:01:20,000
Do you're watching the stream? Turn and nod.

858
01:01:24,000 --> 01:01:26,000
That wasn't a nod.

859
01:01:27,000 --> 01:01:29,000
I'm on to you.

860
01:01:29,000 --> 01:01:32,000
I'm on to you, you little snake.

861
01:01:33,000 --> 01:01:39,000
Yeah, you're gonna watch the stream. You think you can play this game and watch the stream? Don't you block it me?

862
01:01:41,000 --> 01:01:44,000
All right, first person to fall off wins. I fucking won.

863
01:01:54,000 --> 01:01:56,000
Look at how hard that word.

864
01:01:56,000 --> 01:01:59,000
Fuck it hurt. Imagine how much this would hurt. Just like...

865
01:02:02,000 --> 01:02:04,000
Hey calm down.

866
01:02:05,000 --> 01:02:07,000
I said calm down.

867
01:02:11,000 --> 01:02:13,000
Let's do it.

868
01:02:15,000 --> 01:02:21,000
Turn me, you dummy. What? Why am I dummy? What does that do to deserve that?

869
01:02:21,000 --> 01:02:23,000
There's no way I can do it.

870
01:02:31,000 --> 01:02:33,000
There's not hard. This is gonna be hard.

871
01:02:36,000 --> 01:02:40,000
I want to give more money to you. Is it really so hard? I just want you to have my dollars.

872
01:02:45,000 --> 01:02:48,000
It's weird. I'm gonna weird spot.

873
01:02:49,000 --> 01:02:52,000
I don't know. I don't know. You guys know how I feel about that.

874
01:02:53,000 --> 01:02:58,000
I just like to make videos in play games and stream sometimes.

875
01:03:00,000 --> 01:03:04,000
I make videos and hang out. I don't like... I just don't care.

876
01:03:06,000 --> 01:03:12,000
I don't want this stream or my YouTube channel to be about how much money I can make.

877
01:03:12,000 --> 01:03:14,000
It's never really been about that.

878
01:03:15,000 --> 01:03:19,000
I know some people will say like, what the fuck are you talking about? What are you stupid?

879
01:03:19,000 --> 01:03:22,000
Yeah. That pretty fucking stupid.

880
01:03:22,000 --> 01:03:25,000
There's nothing to do with it. How dare you.

881
01:03:40,000 --> 01:03:42,000
Hey everyone talking shit about me streaming?

882
01:03:42,000 --> 01:03:46,000
I've streamed every single day in 2016 so far.

883
01:03:46,000 --> 01:03:51,000
What's that? Every single second of 2016.

884
01:03:51,000 --> 01:03:58,000
How many streamers do you know that can say that they've streamed every single second of 2016?

885
01:03:59,000 --> 01:04:02,000
That's tough to... I don't know. That's tough to come by, man.

886
01:04:03,000 --> 01:04:08,000
Well optimistic pick. Thanks for sticking around and hanging out and watching.

887
01:04:12,000 --> 01:04:15,000
I like that guys, boys.

888
01:04:15,000 --> 01:04:18,000
Why? Untamed.

889
01:04:18,000 --> 01:04:21,000
The acting in this game is actually really good.

890
01:04:21,000 --> 01:04:24,000
They say a lot of interesting things and they're very good.

891
01:04:24,000 --> 01:04:26,000
I don't know.

892
01:04:26,000 --> 01:04:28,000
I don't know.

893
01:04:28,000 --> 01:04:30,000
The acting in this game is actually really good.

894
01:04:30,000 --> 01:04:33,000
They say a lot of interesting things and they're very good at it.

895
01:04:44,000 --> 01:04:46,000
Oh, you guys are only dead?

896
01:04:50,000 --> 01:04:53,000
Why is that like...

897
01:04:54,000 --> 01:04:57,000
Left for dead rats edition.

898
01:04:58,000 --> 01:05:01,000
I'm just sniping.

899
01:05:02,000 --> 01:05:05,000
I like just sitting back and shooting. It's fun.

900
01:05:05,000 --> 01:05:09,000
Ooh, that was a headshot. I got that, dude. That was an armored guy too.

901
01:05:09,000 --> 01:05:12,000
I'm proud of that one.

902
01:05:12,000 --> 01:05:16,000
I'm very proud of that one.

903
01:05:21,000 --> 01:05:26,000
That's so satisfying. When you get the big club in the head and they explode their heads, it's great.

904
01:05:26,000 --> 01:05:29,000
Like that.

905
01:05:29,000 --> 01:05:32,000
Oh, whoa, whoa, easy.

906
01:05:48,000 --> 01:05:51,000
I've not tried the Steadfin trailer.

907
01:05:51,000 --> 01:05:54,000
I don't know if I'd even like to either.

908
01:05:54,000 --> 01:05:58,000
I don't really have the necessary reason why I want to use it.

909
01:05:58,000 --> 01:06:01,000
Where are we? We're getting kind of split up here.

910
01:06:13,000 --> 01:06:15,000
Rattling gun, shit.

911
01:06:19,000 --> 01:06:21,000
That was lucky.

912
01:06:25,000 --> 01:06:28,000
No, he's dead. I got him.

913
01:06:29,000 --> 01:06:34,000
This is actually 90 FOV believer or not. Somebody asked if it was 120.

914
01:06:34,000 --> 01:06:38,000
It feels like it is, but it's not. That's why I made it 85.

915
01:06:47,000 --> 01:06:51,000
Advanced trackpad. Yeah, it's an interesting idea.

916
01:06:51,000 --> 01:06:54,000
But I just don't when I play a game, right?

917
01:06:54,000 --> 01:07:03,000
If I have a controller or if I'm using keyboard mouse, I don't really necessarily care or need and in between.

918
01:07:03,000 --> 01:07:08,000
I don't mind using a controller. I don't mind using a keyboard mouse.

919
01:07:08,000 --> 01:07:14,000
I don't know. I feel like it's kind of an in between with the steam controller.

920
01:07:22,000 --> 01:07:29,000
I'm sure it's cool, but I just don't have the necessary reason to use it.

921
01:07:43,000 --> 01:07:45,000
That's why I'm here.

922
01:07:46,000 --> 01:07:52,000
Now, the interesting thing about this game is there's these things called tones and remores.

923
01:07:52,000 --> 01:08:02,000
Remores, everyone say, where they give you bonus opportunity to get here with more dice that have higher chance to roll face up.

924
01:08:02,000 --> 01:08:09,000
But if you pick up a grimoire, grimoire, I know. I just, I have to say it like that and I'm going to die.

925
01:08:10,000 --> 01:08:14,000
It lowers your health by a pretty large margin and it's two in each level.

926
01:08:15,000 --> 01:08:22,000
So if you really want to try super duper hard, you pick up both the grims and you end up with like 30% HP.

927
01:08:23,000 --> 01:08:26,000
And it is hard.

928
01:08:26,000 --> 01:08:30,000
Oh, oh, oh, wow, wow.

929
01:08:33,000 --> 01:08:35,000
Stay down.

930
01:08:36,000 --> 01:08:42,000
Grimoire, grimoire, grimoire, grimoire.

931
01:08:50,000 --> 01:08:55,000
I always have to assassin that I hear it is. It is. I thought the dwarf was an assassin.

932
01:08:56,000 --> 01:09:02,000
I feel like I'm missing somebody. One thing I wish you could turn on in this game.

933
01:09:02,000 --> 01:09:06,000
Atalus mentioned this as well when we were playing before.

934
01:09:06,000 --> 01:09:12,000
I wish I could turn on faint kind of permanent outlines because sometimes it is hard to turn like for instance the dwarf.

935
01:09:12,000 --> 01:09:19,000
A lot of times I just turn around and think the dwarf is a rat because he's like the same size and has the same body shape.

936
01:09:26,000 --> 01:09:28,000
Oh, yeah.

937
01:09:34,000 --> 01:09:37,000
That's what I'm talking about.

938
01:09:42,000 --> 01:09:45,000
Oh, you feel it.

939
01:09:45,000 --> 01:09:49,000
You can turn on from an outline. Where is it?

940
01:09:49,000 --> 01:09:52,000
I didn't see it in the options menu.

941
01:09:56,000 --> 01:10:01,000
There isn't always outline button.

942
01:10:01,000 --> 01:10:04,000
Hold on a second.

943
01:10:04,000 --> 01:10:07,000
Come on, I want to investigate this.

944
01:10:07,000 --> 01:10:10,000
Most sensitivity weapon switch.

945
01:10:10,000 --> 01:10:14,000
Dodge jump, dodge on diagonal, double tap dodge, disable, and then the next up will engage the tutorial.

946
01:10:14,000 --> 01:10:16,000
Player outlines on.

947
01:10:16,000 --> 01:10:19,000
It's on.

948
01:10:19,000 --> 01:10:23,000
Oh, oh, oh, oh.

949
01:10:23,000 --> 01:10:26,000
Oh, oh, oh.

950
01:10:26,000 --> 01:10:28,000
Did you look at that?

951
01:10:28,000 --> 01:10:32,000
I thought it was either on or off.

952
01:10:32,000 --> 01:10:35,000
I didn't know there was another one.

953
01:10:40,000 --> 01:10:43,000
I don't know, but that's a little, that's a little too much though.

954
01:10:43,000 --> 01:10:46,000
Let me try it for a little bit.

955
01:10:54,000 --> 01:10:56,000
I wish it could, okay, is somebody else correct me?

956
01:10:56,000 --> 01:10:58,000
Can I make that even fainter?

957
01:10:58,000 --> 01:11:01,000
Or probably not?

958
01:11:04,000 --> 01:11:07,000
That is much, much better.

959
01:11:07,000 --> 01:11:11,000
But I wish it was a little lighter.

960
01:11:13,000 --> 01:11:17,000
Yeah, I mean, I saw, I looked at it, it said on.

961
01:11:17,000 --> 01:11:19,000
I was like, oh, on and I figured on or off.

962
01:11:19,000 --> 01:11:22,000
I didn't know there was also like super on.

963
01:11:24,000 --> 01:11:27,000
Yeah, we have on off or super on.

964
01:11:38,000 --> 01:11:41,000
Whoa, you guys can't ignore.

965
01:11:54,000 --> 01:11:57,000
Yeah.

966
01:12:11,000 --> 01:12:14,000
We're in a bad position here.

967
01:12:14,000 --> 01:12:17,000
I don't know if I said very much though.

968
01:12:24,000 --> 01:12:29,000
That's a tank and look at our health.

969
01:12:29,000 --> 01:12:32,000
This is not gonna be good.

970
01:12:32,000 --> 01:12:35,000
This is not gonna be good.

971
01:12:47,000 --> 01:12:49,000
Wow.

972
01:12:49,000 --> 01:12:51,000
God, you guys just come in and know where.

973
01:12:52,000 --> 01:12:56,000
You lost that team.

974
01:12:56,000 --> 01:12:59,000
Oh, the knife is spying.

975
01:13:04,000 --> 01:13:08,000
Yeah, this game is not, this game is not easy.

976
01:13:08,000 --> 01:13:13,000
Hard is actually hard and then there are two other difficulties harder than this.

977
01:13:13,000 --> 01:13:17,000
There is nightmare and cataclysm.

978
01:13:17,000 --> 01:13:20,000
I don't even want to know what this game is like on cataclysm.

979
01:13:20,000 --> 01:13:29,000
And if you do the glimmer wars, I don't even know how difficult that game is gonna be.

980
01:13:29,000 --> 01:13:32,000
There we go.

981
01:13:32,000 --> 01:13:35,000
I missed that really.

982
01:13:35,000 --> 01:13:38,000
How is that possible?

983
01:13:39,000 --> 01:13:43,000
I've learned when to speak.

984
01:13:45,000 --> 01:13:48,000
Make sure we're gonna get wrapped around.

985
01:13:48,000 --> 01:13:53,000
How are we doing?

986
01:13:53,000 --> 01:13:56,000
Sassin.

987
01:13:56,000 --> 01:13:57,000
Very nice.

988
01:13:57,000 --> 01:13:58,000
Very nice.

989
01:13:58,000 --> 01:14:02,000
That was a good shot with the shotgun from up here.

990
01:14:02,000 --> 01:14:05,000
You get a plus one.

991
01:14:05,000 --> 01:14:08,000
Super skill.

992
01:14:08,000 --> 01:14:11,000
Oh, the other.

993
01:14:11,000 --> 01:14:14,000
Cheers.

994
01:14:14,000 --> 01:14:19,000
Oh, the hands of the next.

995
01:14:19,000 --> 01:14:22,000
Yeah.

996
01:14:23,000 --> 01:14:26,000
Yeah.

997
01:14:26,000 --> 01:14:29,000
Yeah.

998
01:14:29,000 --> 01:14:36,000
Holy charred.

999
01:14:36,000 --> 01:14:49,000
Get some barrels.

1000
01:14:49,000 --> 01:14:59,000
We're just gonna go as a team or we're gonna wait and get all a couple of them.

1001
01:14:59,000 --> 01:15:10,000
Is it okay if I drop some pickup lines in here so I can get it.

1002
01:15:10,000 --> 01:15:18,000
You can do it every one, man.

1003
01:15:18,000 --> 01:15:24,000
Get out of here.

1004
01:15:24,000 --> 01:15:36,000
I love that sometimes they just run around looking at you like, who do I hit?

1005
01:15:36,000 --> 01:15:43,000
I don't know who it is.

1006
01:15:43,000 --> 01:15:46,000
Where's the last one go over there somewhere?

1007
01:15:46,000 --> 01:15:49,000
Let's carry it.

1008
01:15:49,000 --> 01:15:56,000
Let's go, man.

1009
01:15:56,000 --> 01:15:59,000
Watch out.

1010
01:15:59,000 --> 01:16:01,000
Hey, stop procrastinating.

1011
01:16:01,000 --> 01:16:04,000
Guy that just asked about procrastinating, stop doing that.

1012
01:16:04,000 --> 01:16:06,000
Don't procrastinate anymore.

1013
01:16:06,000 --> 01:16:07,000
Do it today.

1014
01:16:07,000 --> 01:16:10,000
Do it right now.

1015
01:16:10,000 --> 01:16:13,000
Close the stream and hold on.

1016
01:16:13,000 --> 01:16:18,000
I don't want to shoot the barrel.

1017
01:16:18,000 --> 01:16:20,000
They can shoot the barrels.

1018
01:16:20,000 --> 01:16:25,000
You can't shoot everything up.

1019
01:16:25,000 --> 01:16:35,000
Push him.

1020
01:16:35,000 --> 01:16:42,000
Get the fuck out of here.

1021
01:16:42,000 --> 01:16:46,000
And three.

1022
01:16:46,000 --> 01:16:53,000
Woo.

1023
01:16:53,000 --> 01:16:55,000
I've got it done last year.

1024
01:16:55,000 --> 01:17:08,000
He waited a year.

1025
01:17:08,000 --> 01:17:24,000
I love that big swing.

1026
01:17:24,000 --> 01:17:25,000
It's great.

1027
01:17:25,000 --> 01:17:31,000
It feels so fun to hit people with it.

1028
01:17:31,000 --> 01:17:40,000
I'm not doing anything stupid.

1029
01:17:40,000 --> 01:17:46,000
I was trying to do something fucking silly.

1030
01:17:46,000 --> 01:17:52,000
Never do anything silly when you're on hard.

1031
01:17:52,000 --> 01:17:55,000
Warhammer is a universe.

1032
01:17:55,000 --> 01:18:00,000
They license it out for different developers to make different games.

1033
01:18:00,000 --> 01:18:05,000
The Warhammer game that you play is not made by the same company.

1034
01:18:05,000 --> 01:18:07,000
It's kind of here or there.

1035
01:18:07,000 --> 01:18:13,000
Some of my favorite RTS games ever were the 40k series Warhammer 40k.

1036
01:18:13,000 --> 01:18:24,000
Donovan War was probably one of my favorite RTS games.

1037
01:18:24,000 --> 01:18:32,000
I've got a lot of stuff.

1038
01:18:32,000 --> 01:18:37,000
I'm just playing as the Tao.

1039
01:18:37,000 --> 01:18:41,000
Somebody else just picked that up.

1040
01:18:41,000 --> 01:18:45,000
I already got one.

1041
01:18:45,000 --> 01:18:51,000
Wow, he's cleared that up.

1042
01:18:51,000 --> 01:18:55,000
Nobody's gonna take that.

1043
01:18:55,000 --> 01:18:59,000
Fine, I'll heal.

1044
01:18:59,000 --> 01:19:06,000
I'll heal and I'll take it.

1045
01:19:06,000 --> 01:19:10,000
Game of the year was a blood one.

1046
01:19:10,000 --> 01:19:13,000
Blood going victim brand.

1047
01:19:13,000 --> 01:19:17,000
Probably bonny Isaac.

1048
01:19:17,000 --> 01:19:21,000
I didn't really play a whole lot of the top big games in 2000.

1049
01:19:21,000 --> 01:19:26,000
A tomb.

1050
01:19:26,000 --> 01:19:31,000
I'm gonna grab the tomb.

1051
01:19:31,000 --> 01:19:33,000
We have two tomes.

1052
01:19:33,000 --> 01:19:36,000
We have two tomes.

1053
01:19:36,000 --> 01:19:39,000
Somebody do that.

1054
01:19:39,000 --> 01:19:46,000
Let me eat that.

1055
01:19:46,000 --> 01:19:49,000
Follow four.

1056
01:19:49,000 --> 01:19:52,000
Follow four was game of the year.

1057
01:19:52,000 --> 01:19:57,000
I wouldn't put follow four in the top five.

1058
01:19:57,000 --> 01:20:03,000
I can't believe they put a fucking entire Egyptian tomb in that book.

1059
01:20:03,000 --> 01:20:11,000
I like saying tomb.

1060
01:20:11,000 --> 01:20:15,000
No, it's tomb.

1061
01:20:15,000 --> 01:20:19,000
The tomb of unknown secrets.

1062
01:20:19,000 --> 01:20:32,000
I don't think follow four was a bad game, but I don't think it was necessarily a great game.

1063
01:20:32,000 --> 01:20:36,000
I don't think follow four was game of the year good.

1064
01:20:36,000 --> 01:20:44,000
I just don't.

1065
01:20:44,000 --> 01:20:47,000
It wasn't a bad game.

1066
01:20:47,000 --> 01:20:51,000
It just means it wasn't the best game I've ever played.

1067
01:20:51,000 --> 01:21:06,000
I don't think we might make a mark for the view.

1068
01:21:06,000 --> 01:21:11,000
I am not even close.

1069
01:21:11,000 --> 01:21:14,000
I want to go inside.

1070
01:21:14,000 --> 01:21:16,000
This is a bad idea.

1071
01:21:16,000 --> 01:21:19,000
I didn't do anything for me.

1072
01:21:19,000 --> 01:21:22,000
All this did was get me stuck.

1073
01:21:22,000 --> 01:21:27,000
This is not the right way.

1074
01:21:27,000 --> 01:21:30,000
The half man of the woods.

1075
01:21:30,000 --> 01:21:34,000
We're not going up here.

1076
01:21:34,000 --> 01:21:39,000
Apparently not.

1077
01:21:39,000 --> 01:21:48,000
I haven't put enough time into under.

1078
01:21:48,000 --> 01:21:51,000
I've played Undertale.

1079
01:21:51,000 --> 01:21:53,000
I have for a couple hours.

1080
01:21:53,000 --> 01:22:00,000
I haven't put enough time into Undertale to say it was the best game of the year.

1081
01:22:00,000 --> 01:22:05,000
I haven't played it for more than a couple hours.

1082
01:22:05,000 --> 01:22:11,000
I don't know what to do here.

1083
01:22:11,000 --> 01:22:15,000
I gotta leave.

1084
01:22:15,000 --> 01:22:20,000
There's two gunners down there.

1085
01:22:20,000 --> 01:22:22,000
Jeez.

1086
01:22:22,000 --> 01:22:24,000
What are the bullets?

1087
01:22:24,000 --> 01:22:26,000
This is not good.

1088
01:22:26,000 --> 01:22:27,000
Not good.

1089
01:22:27,000 --> 01:22:28,000
Not good.

1090
01:22:28,000 --> 01:22:29,000
Not good.

1091
01:22:29,000 --> 01:22:30,000
I don't know what to do here.

1092
01:22:30,000 --> 01:22:31,000
Not good.

1093
01:22:31,000 --> 01:22:32,000
We got to leave.

1094
01:22:32,000 --> 01:22:35,000
We got to go jump down.

1095
01:22:35,000 --> 01:22:37,000
Too many gunners.

1096
01:22:37,000 --> 01:22:39,000
Can't go back up there.

1097
01:22:39,000 --> 01:22:41,000
She's just gone.

1098
01:22:41,000 --> 01:22:43,000
Look at our max health.

1099
01:22:43,000 --> 01:22:49,000
That is what happens when you pick up the two tombs.

1100
01:22:49,000 --> 01:22:59,000
You have no help.

1101
01:22:59,000 --> 01:23:06,000
There he is.

1102
01:23:06,000 --> 01:23:10,000
Oh geez.

1103
01:23:10,000 --> 01:23:12,000
Anybody have any guns?

1104
01:23:12,000 --> 01:23:16,000
That's a terrible place for him to be.

1105
01:23:16,000 --> 01:23:22,000
How the fuck are we going to get through that?

1106
01:23:22,000 --> 01:23:24,000
No!

1107
01:23:24,000 --> 01:23:28,000
Rocked right into a pack guy.

1108
01:23:28,000 --> 01:23:35,000
I'm still miraculously.

1109
01:23:35,000 --> 01:23:36,000
Fuck.

1110
01:23:36,000 --> 01:23:40,000
I was trying to block the attack so they could go.

1111
01:23:40,000 --> 01:23:41,000
Trying to jump.

1112
01:23:41,000 --> 01:23:42,000
Oh, we're in deep shit here.

1113
01:23:42,000 --> 01:23:45,000
Those two machine gunners being spawned right behind us there.

1114
01:23:45,000 --> 01:23:48,000
It was the worst thing that could happen.

1115
01:23:48,000 --> 01:23:50,000
Good luck to this guy.

1116
01:23:50,000 --> 01:23:52,000
That's game over.

1117
01:23:52,000 --> 01:23:57,000
That is a game over.

1118
01:23:57,000 --> 01:24:09,000
Oh well.

1119
01:24:09,000 --> 01:24:11,000
Hey cool.

1120
01:24:11,000 --> 01:24:20,000
You know, upgraded that item.

1121
01:24:20,000 --> 01:24:21,000
Dark Souls 3.

1122
01:24:21,000 --> 01:24:23,000
Looking forward to other things.

1123
01:24:23,000 --> 01:24:29,000
Dark Souls 3 for sure.

1124
01:24:29,000 --> 01:24:31,000
Let's just try it again.

1125
01:24:31,000 --> 01:24:37,000
We kind of got a bad deal there.

1126
01:24:37,000 --> 01:24:40,000
The scuven are up in the anti.

1127
01:24:40,000 --> 01:24:45,000
They're out in the forest building wall machines.

1128
01:24:45,000 --> 01:24:47,000
Never go to Grims with pubs.

1129
01:24:47,000 --> 01:24:49,000
It's hard.

1130
01:24:49,000 --> 01:24:52,000
Oh, italics wants to play.

1131
01:24:52,000 --> 01:24:55,000
Video game called vermin type.

1132
01:24:55,000 --> 01:24:56,000
I don't know.

1133
01:24:56,000 --> 01:24:58,000
I'll tell you what we'll get you in the next one.

1134
01:24:58,000 --> 01:25:02,000
Is that cool?

1135
01:25:02,000 --> 01:25:06,000
I just like these guys just joined.

1136
01:25:06,000 --> 01:25:21,000
Not like more than 15-20 minutes ago.

1137
01:25:21,000 --> 01:25:23,000
Oh, by the way, italics there.

1138
01:25:23,000 --> 01:25:25,000
Look, do you see something?

1139
01:25:25,000 --> 01:25:29,000
Do you notice the always on outline?

1140
01:25:29,000 --> 01:25:33,000
It was actually in the options we just didn't even see it.

1141
01:25:33,000 --> 01:25:36,000
There was another option to keep it always on.

1142
01:25:36,000 --> 01:25:45,000
Rather than just on sometimes.

1143
01:25:45,000 --> 01:25:48,000
You guys all have to leave.

1144
01:25:48,000 --> 01:25:51,000
We need to free up one spot.

1145
01:25:51,000 --> 01:25:57,000
You guys are going to have to do rock paper scissors.

1146
01:25:57,000 --> 01:26:03,000
Rock paper vermin type.

1147
01:26:03,000 --> 01:26:07,000
Oh, did he just appeared in my face?

1148
01:26:07,000 --> 01:26:08,000
You guys all saw that.

1149
01:26:08,000 --> 01:26:11,000
That was odd.

1150
01:26:11,000 --> 01:26:14,000
That's a bad reason.

1151
01:26:14,000 --> 01:26:17,000
Let me have her there the way about.

1152
01:26:17,000 --> 01:26:20,000
That's a bad reason.

1153
01:26:20,000 --> 01:26:24,000
Now, it's an ambush.

1154
01:26:24,000 --> 01:26:25,000
What?

1155
01:26:25,000 --> 01:26:28,000
Oh, another opponent.

1156
01:26:28,000 --> 01:26:32,000
Oh, I'm too old to kill the few.

1157
01:26:32,000 --> 01:26:36,000
What you doing?

1158
01:26:36,000 --> 01:26:42,000
Stop.

1159
01:26:42,000 --> 01:26:46,000
That kind of been worse.

1160
01:26:46,000 --> 01:26:50,000
Totally worse.

1161
01:26:50,000 --> 01:27:03,000
Watch, watch, hey, watch, watch your six.

1162
01:27:03,000 --> 01:27:13,000
Where are the healing things?

1163
01:27:13,000 --> 01:27:19,000
Is there only one or two?

1164
01:27:19,000 --> 01:27:21,000
Some of you guys are quick.

1165
01:27:21,000 --> 01:27:24,000
This guy with the bow, you are quick, man.

1166
01:27:24,000 --> 01:27:28,000
I thought I was going to kill that guy.

1167
01:27:28,000 --> 01:27:35,000
You are a quick one.

1168
01:27:35,000 --> 01:27:42,000
No door ring.

1169
01:27:42,000 --> 01:28:01,000
I want this game, but I don't $25 want this game.

1170
01:28:01,000 --> 01:28:06,000
Yeah, I mean, it's.

1171
01:28:06,000 --> 01:28:08,000
It's good.

1172
01:28:08,000 --> 01:28:15,000
It's a full done complete 13 mission game with a bunch of items.

1173
01:28:15,000 --> 01:28:23,000
It's, I would say it's probably worth the $25 because it's not necessarily a play that game.

1174
01:28:23,000 --> 01:28:29,000
I can complete that whole game in like an hour and ten minutes.

1175
01:28:29,000 --> 01:28:33,000
I mean, you want to experience all levels and play with the characters and items.

1176
01:28:33,000 --> 01:28:37,000
I think it's worth the $25 price tag.

1177
01:28:37,000 --> 01:28:39,000
Like you said, is it worth it for you?

1178
01:28:39,000 --> 01:28:42,000
Is that like, is it worth the $25 for you?

1179
01:28:42,000 --> 01:28:48,000
Which may am I not be the case?

1180
01:28:48,000 --> 01:28:59,000
It does just follow the same leopard ed formula.

1181
01:28:59,000 --> 01:29:04,000
So if you got your fill out of leopard ed and you don't really care about that type of game anymore,

1182
01:29:04,000 --> 01:29:11,000
it's just a lot of the same shit, a astronomical amount of the same stuff.

1183
01:29:11,000 --> 01:29:22,000
But if you ever thought to yourself, hey, a melee only, like 80% melee left for dead in Warhammer's storyline,

1184
01:29:22,000 --> 01:29:28,000
is a game that I think might be cool, then this is a game that you would want to play.

1185
01:29:28,000 --> 01:29:40,000
We all shot him and he didn't die.

1186
01:29:40,000 --> 01:29:49,000
Let's guys have a lot of health.

1187
01:29:49,000 --> 01:29:50,000
Yeah, there you go.

1188
01:29:50,000 --> 01:29:53,000
It's worth $25 if you have a couple friends that also get it too.

1189
01:29:53,000 --> 01:29:57,000
Because then you can all enjoy the game.

1190
01:29:58,000 --> 01:30:03,000
I would say solo buying this game, it might be hard to get a group.

1191
01:30:03,000 --> 01:30:07,000
Because it's not like the most popular game ever.

1192
01:30:07,000 --> 01:30:15,000
I think people still play it. It still has pretty good numbers either.

1193
01:30:15,000 --> 01:30:18,000
So look at how many are on that bridge.

1194
01:30:18,000 --> 01:30:26,000
Holy shit.

1195
01:30:26,000 --> 01:30:36,000
I'm not sure.

1196
01:30:36,000 --> 01:30:41,000
Get him.

1197
01:30:41,000 --> 01:30:48,000
Got him.

1198
01:30:48,000 --> 01:30:55,000
I want this game with Lord of the Rings. Yeah, it's Alex. That would be amazing.

1199
01:30:55,000 --> 01:31:09,000
Yeah, that's a stash I will take.

1200
01:31:09,000 --> 01:31:14,000
Hey, I could use one of those.

1201
01:31:14,000 --> 01:31:19,000
They're adding a solo mode eventually.

1202
01:31:19,000 --> 01:31:25,000
That's cool. I wonder what that would be like.

1203
01:31:25,000 --> 01:31:34,000
I don't know what that would be like.

1204
01:31:34,000 --> 01:31:42,000
I took that guy's head off. Don't worry about it.

1205
01:31:42,000 --> 01:31:45,000
I'm not a bridge.

1206
01:31:45,000 --> 01:31:49,000
Thank you. Thank you, Foxy.

1207
01:31:49,000 --> 01:31:59,000
You've been hitting some nice shots too.

1208
01:31:59,000 --> 01:32:09,000
We're all just skipping. There's a tomb.

1209
01:32:09,000 --> 01:32:12,000
This is a fun game just to stream.

1210
01:32:12,000 --> 01:32:15,000
It doesn't really require.

1211
01:32:15,000 --> 01:32:20,000
I can just sit here and just talk and hang out and hit the hammer.

1212
01:32:20,000 --> 01:32:25,000
Look at that. Do you see the reaction time?

1213
01:32:25,000 --> 01:32:31,000
Good fucking job. Then here comes a tank.

1214
01:32:31,000 --> 01:32:40,000
There it is.

1215
01:32:40,000 --> 01:32:43,000
I don't think it's wrapped around.

1216
01:32:43,000 --> 01:32:51,000
Shit. God. God. I'm on a fucking tree.

1217
01:32:51,000 --> 01:32:58,000
I'm on a fucking tree.

1218
01:32:58,000 --> 01:33:06,000
Right in the head. Right in the head.

1219
01:33:06,000 --> 01:33:13,000
I blocked that last second.

1220
01:33:13,000 --> 01:33:20,000
Nice.

1221
01:33:20,000 --> 01:33:27,000
I'm on a fucking tree.

1222
01:33:27,000 --> 01:33:32,000
The door.

1223
01:33:32,000 --> 01:33:37,000
He's got a Scottish accent.

1224
01:33:37,000 --> 01:33:41,000
Where is he? I heard him.

1225
01:33:41,000 --> 01:33:44,000
Oh, is this guy?

1226
01:33:44,000 --> 01:33:51,000
Heard it.

1227
01:33:51,000 --> 01:33:58,000
The women's high.

1228
01:33:58,000 --> 01:34:05,000
I do like how this is pretty much always a one hit kill though.

1229
01:34:05,000 --> 01:34:09,000
Very nice. Very nice.

1230
01:34:09,000 --> 01:34:12,000
Very nice.

1231
01:34:12,000 --> 01:34:16,000
I need more bombs. He's barely any.

1232
01:34:16,000 --> 01:34:19,000
Hey, thanks for subbing.

1233
01:34:19,000 --> 01:34:22,000
Panda man. Thanks for the sub.

1234
01:34:22,000 --> 01:34:24,000
Thank you.

1235
01:34:24,000 --> 01:34:27,000
I'm probably not in this.

1236
01:34:27,000 --> 01:34:30,000
I don't have any fucking shit.

1237
01:34:30,000 --> 01:34:34,000
I don't have any sub notification for anything.

1238
01:34:34,000 --> 01:34:38,000
It's been like a hectic couple weeks though guys.

1239
01:34:38,000 --> 01:34:41,000
Last like three weeks.

1240
01:34:41,000 --> 01:34:44,000
There's been so many things I've wanted to do that I just haven't been able to.

1241
01:34:44,000 --> 01:34:46,000
A thousand different reasons.

1242
01:34:46,000 --> 01:34:49,000
But you know, that's life.

1243
01:34:49,000 --> 01:34:56,000
That's life.

1244
01:34:56,000 --> 01:35:01,000
Where they going?

1245
01:35:01,000 --> 01:35:03,000
We'll put it over here.

1246
01:35:03,000 --> 01:35:07,000
Oh, you already got it.

1247
01:35:07,000 --> 01:35:12,000
Oh, scut thanks for sub.

1248
01:35:12,000 --> 01:35:18,000
Thanks to anybody that sub.

1249
01:35:18,000 --> 01:35:25,000
I thought I missed.

1250
01:35:25,000 --> 01:35:29,000
I'm going to kill that guy.

1251
01:35:29,000 --> 01:35:31,000
I want to hit that guy in the head.

1252
01:35:31,000 --> 01:35:33,000
I got to get that guy in his head.

1253
01:35:33,000 --> 01:35:35,000
I hit the other guy next to him with a head.

1254
01:35:35,000 --> 01:35:40,000
I'm going to kill that guy.

1255
01:35:40,000 --> 01:35:45,000
I'm going to kill that guy.

1256
01:35:45,000 --> 01:35:49,000
I'm going to kill that guy.

1257
01:35:49,000 --> 01:35:53,000
I'm going to kill that guy.

1258
01:35:53,000 --> 01:35:55,000
Hey, princess awesome.

1259
01:35:55,000 --> 01:35:58,000
Thanks for the host.

1260
01:35:58,000 --> 01:36:01,000
Thanks for the sub.

1261
01:36:01,000 --> 01:36:04,000
Thanks for the sub.

1262
01:36:04,000 --> 01:36:11,000
I got it.

1263
01:36:11,000 --> 01:36:17,000
I got it.

1264
01:36:17,000 --> 01:36:26,000
Nice.

1265
01:36:26,000 --> 01:36:31,000
Let's get out of here.

1266
01:36:31,000 --> 01:36:36,000
Damn it.

1267
01:36:36,000 --> 01:36:40,000
I don't even know why I'm shooting these little shits.

1268
01:36:40,000 --> 01:36:41,000
I shouldn't be.

1269
01:36:41,000 --> 01:36:49,000
You need to save those for special rats.

1270
01:36:49,000 --> 01:36:56,000
Come on.

1271
01:36:57,000 --> 01:37:01,000
I'm going to get him.

1272
01:37:01,000 --> 01:37:06,000
I got him.

1273
01:37:06,000 --> 01:37:11,000
Watch your back.

1274
01:37:11,000 --> 01:37:15,000
Where is he?

1275
01:37:15,000 --> 01:37:19,000
Hey, you.

1276
01:37:19,000 --> 01:37:29,000
There's a little dodge.

1277
01:37:29,000 --> 01:37:35,000
You can do backwards.

1278
01:37:35,000 --> 01:37:38,000
I'm not forward.

1279
01:37:38,000 --> 01:37:43,000
Give me the dodge.

1280
01:37:43,000 --> 01:37:49,000
Did we get a grim?

1281
01:37:49,000 --> 01:37:51,000
I think we did.

1282
01:37:51,000 --> 01:37:53,000
It's gonna be tough.

1283
01:37:53,000 --> 01:37:55,000
We're gonna have the healing.

1284
01:37:55,000 --> 01:37:57,000
Does anybody have a bomb? We got two bombs.

1285
01:37:57,000 --> 01:37:59,000
We should be able to do this.

1286
01:37:59,000 --> 01:38:03,000
And that should be the...

1287
01:38:03,000 --> 01:38:05,000
...question.

1288
01:38:05,000 --> 01:38:11,000
Alrighty.

1289
01:38:12,000 --> 01:38:14,000
Wow.

1290
01:38:17,000 --> 01:38:19,000
Are you good?

1291
01:38:19,000 --> 01:38:21,000
I think we're good.

1292
01:38:21,000 --> 01:38:23,000
I think we're good.

1293
01:38:23,000 --> 01:38:25,000
I'm excited for the Deadpool movie.

1294
01:38:25,000 --> 01:38:27,000
Yeah?

1295
01:38:27,000 --> 01:38:29,000
I'm unissue.

1296
01:38:29,000 --> 01:38:31,000
I don't know. Should we...

1297
01:38:31,000 --> 01:38:33,000
Yeah.

1298
01:38:33,000 --> 01:38:35,000
I'm dead.

1299
01:38:35,000 --> 01:38:37,000
I'm dead.

1300
01:38:37,000 --> 01:38:39,000
I'm dead.

1301
01:38:39,000 --> 01:38:41,000
I'm dead.

1302
01:38:41,000 --> 01:38:43,000
I'm dead.

1303
01:38:43,000 --> 01:38:47,000
I'm dead.

1304
01:38:47,000 --> 01:38:49,000
I'm dead.

1305
01:38:49,000 --> 01:38:51,000
I'm dead.

1306
01:38:51,000 --> 01:38:57,000
I think we just had so many superhero movies over the last few years.

1307
01:38:57,000 --> 01:39:03,000
I'm sort of desensitized to them all at this point.

1308
01:39:03,000 --> 01:39:13,000
But yeah, I mean I'll watch it.

1309
01:39:13,000 --> 01:39:17,000
View 12s, a bloodstain for them.

1310
01:39:17,000 --> 01:39:24,000
is

1311
01:39:24,000 --> 01:39:25,000
what we died last time right

1312
01:39:25,000 --> 01:39:27,000
further past this

1313
01:39:27,000 --> 01:39:35,000
let's make it past this one let's get out of this

1314
01:39:35,000 --> 01:39:37,000
slah

1315
01:39:37,000 --> 01:39:40,000
the

1316
01:39:40,000 --> 01:39:45,000
looks

1317
01:39:45,000 --> 01:39:51,000
to do say questions

1318
01:39:51,000 --> 01:39:58,000
my shot

1319
01:39:58,000 --> 01:40:04,000
and we have two crimes now is this is what we died last time we're going to be

1320
01:40:04,000 --> 01:40:05,000
very very careful

1321
01:40:05,000 --> 01:40:11,000
this is exactly where we lost last time with these two grims

1322
01:40:11,000 --> 01:40:14,000
yes

1323
01:40:14,000 --> 01:40:18,000
from

1324
01:40:18,000 --> 01:40:20,000
to scare to the enemy

1325
01:40:20,000 --> 01:40:26,000
take to the last time

1326
01:40:26,000 --> 01:40:33,000
on

1327
01:40:33,000 --> 01:40:36,000
take

1328
01:40:36,000 --> 01:40:38,000
from

1329
01:40:38,000 --> 01:40:49,000
the

1330
01:40:49,000 --> 01:40:52,000
one movie are you excited for a lot of movies that I wanted to watch already came up and I've already seen

1331
01:40:52,000 --> 01:40:55,000
the

1332
01:40:55,000 --> 01:40:59,000
enjoyed them I think I liked the hateful eight more than I like Star Wars

1333
01:40:59,000 --> 01:41:10,000
I mean I like Tarantino guy Tarantino kind of guy

1334
01:41:10,000 --> 01:41:19,000
where is he gonna show up right there

1335
01:41:20,000 --> 01:41:27,000
namely

1336
01:41:27,000 --> 01:41:42,000
I did go to the 70 millimeter showing and it was glorious.

1337
01:41:57,000 --> 01:42:04,000
I'm going to have one.

1338
01:42:04,000 --> 01:42:07,000
13 is a weird guy.

1339
01:42:07,000 --> 01:42:15,000
That's one way to describe it.

1340
01:42:15,000 --> 01:42:22,000
I think we're almost out of the woods here.

1341
01:42:23,000 --> 01:42:31,000
Where is he?

1342
01:42:31,000 --> 01:42:33,000
I'm going to go this way.

1343
01:42:33,000 --> 01:42:34,000
I'm going to go around.

1344
01:42:34,000 --> 01:42:38,000
I don't want to get stuck over here.

1345
01:42:38,000 --> 01:42:48,000
Shitload of people coming this way.

1346
01:42:48,000 --> 01:42:50,000
Where is he?

1347
01:42:50,000 --> 01:42:51,000
Really?

1348
01:42:51,000 --> 01:42:55,000
I thought I got you with that.

1349
01:42:55,000 --> 01:43:03,000
Get away.

1350
01:43:03,000 --> 01:43:06,000
Goodness.

1351
01:43:06,000 --> 01:43:10,000
Tarantino also loves closing car trunks.

1352
01:43:10,000 --> 01:43:13,000
There's a lot of things that Tarantino likes to do.

1353
01:43:13,000 --> 01:43:17,000
That's in almost every movie, right?

1354
01:43:17,000 --> 01:43:24,000
I'm going to go around.

1355
01:43:24,000 --> 01:43:29,000
Just make sure they're dead.

1356
01:43:29,000 --> 01:43:37,000
You got to hit them twice.

1357
01:43:37,000 --> 01:43:44,000
It should be close to the end here.

1358
01:43:44,000 --> 01:43:52,000
Looks like a person has no one.

1359
01:43:52,000 --> 01:44:01,000
The rest of the way.

1360
01:44:01,000 --> 01:44:08,000
We still have two two.

1361
01:44:08,000 --> 01:44:12,000
Actually, wait a minute.

1362
01:44:12,000 --> 01:44:14,000
No, you need this.

1363
01:44:14,000 --> 01:44:18,000
Come here.

1364
01:44:18,000 --> 01:44:23,000
You need that more than I do.

1365
01:44:23,000 --> 01:44:30,000
You need that way more than I do.

1366
01:44:30,000 --> 01:44:40,000
One more to defend event.

1367
01:44:40,000 --> 01:44:44,000
That's what we do.

1368
01:44:44,000 --> 01:44:48,000
I just get so self-conscious.

1369
01:44:48,000 --> 01:44:54,000
When we have this few health, it makes me so nervous.

1370
01:44:54,000 --> 01:44:59,000
You take a couple hits like this and you're just done.

1371
01:44:59,000 --> 01:45:02,000
You get too nervous like this.

1372
01:45:02,000 --> 01:45:06,000
I don't like doing two of the rims as much as it's awesome to get items.

1373
01:45:06,000 --> 01:45:12,000
Especially not hard.

1374
01:45:12,000 --> 01:45:23,000
We've got to have more confidence.

1375
01:45:23,000 --> 01:45:28,000
Get to full health.

1376
01:45:28,000 --> 01:45:31,000
Another health.

1377
01:45:31,000 --> 01:45:34,000
Somebody gets a dire.

1378
01:45:34,000 --> 01:45:37,000
Gunner up top.

1379
01:45:37,000 --> 01:45:41,000
He's dead.

1380
01:45:41,000 --> 01:45:45,000
Anything else?

1381
01:45:45,000 --> 01:45:50,000
What's the ammo?

1382
01:45:50,000 --> 01:45:54,000
We only need to stand somewhere.

1383
01:45:54,000 --> 01:45:59,000
Is that the strategy?

1384
01:45:59,000 --> 01:46:02,000
I guess it is.

1385
01:46:02,000 --> 01:46:06,000
Look at this.

1386
01:46:06,000 --> 01:46:12,000
Back in the left for dead days, we used to do the bathroom strat.

1387
01:46:12,000 --> 01:46:17,000
All four people would stuff into one of the tiny bathrooms.

1388
01:46:17,000 --> 01:46:21,000
It worked for about a minute or two until a tank came.

1389
01:46:21,000 --> 01:46:26,000
The bathroom strat was fine.

1390
01:46:26,000 --> 01:46:29,000
They won't know we're in here.

1391
01:46:29,000 --> 01:46:34,000
What does wait for the boat?

1392
01:46:34,000 --> 01:46:38,000
I love shit like this.

1393
01:46:38,000 --> 01:46:44,000
I have to come through one door.

1394
01:46:44,000 --> 01:46:49,000
I'm not sure if I can get out of here.

1395
01:46:49,000 --> 01:46:54,000
They were just phasing through.

1396
01:46:54,000 --> 01:46:58,000
What the fuck is happening?

1397
01:46:58,000 --> 01:47:05,000
Why?

1398
01:47:05,000 --> 01:47:10,000
I was just getting stuck inside.

1399
01:47:10,000 --> 01:47:13,000
No one's trying to open it.

1400
01:47:13,000 --> 01:47:21,000
What is this?

1401
01:47:21,000 --> 01:47:31,000
Oh, easy.

1402
01:47:31,000 --> 01:47:36,000
The one that was just stuck laying around.

1403
01:47:36,000 --> 01:47:41,000
What the fuck is that?

1404
01:47:41,000 --> 01:47:48,000
I'm so confused.

1405
01:47:48,000 --> 01:48:01,000
Getting a lot of kills right now though.

1406
01:48:01,000 --> 01:48:08,000
I'm not sure if I can get out of here.

1407
01:48:08,000 --> 01:48:13,000
Who's shooting the gun?

1408
01:48:13,000 --> 01:48:20,000
Why do I hear a machine gun?

1409
01:48:20,000 --> 01:48:24,000
This works.

1410
01:48:24,000 --> 01:48:30,000
It's all the green goo.

1411
01:48:30,000 --> 01:48:37,000
Let's go.

1412
01:48:37,000 --> 01:48:43,000
Anybody else?

1413
01:48:43,000 --> 01:48:48,000
Hey, we did it.

1414
01:48:48,000 --> 01:48:52,000
I gotta get this guy.

1415
01:48:52,000 --> 01:48:56,000
Nice work.

1416
01:48:56,000 --> 01:48:59,000
GG.

1417
01:48:59,000 --> 01:49:04,000
That was an interesting strategy.

1418
01:49:04,000 --> 01:49:10,000
We're going to have a lot of chances to roll.

1419
01:49:10,000 --> 01:49:13,000
We get a legendary.

1420
01:49:13,000 --> 01:49:18,000
What they're called exotic.

1421
01:49:18,000 --> 01:49:19,000
Come on.

1422
01:49:19,000 --> 01:49:22,000
Do I need one, two, three?

1423
01:49:22,000 --> 01:49:25,000
Let's go.

1424
01:49:25,000 --> 01:49:30,000
Shit.

1425
01:49:30,000 --> 01:49:37,000
That's a trinket though, right?

1426
01:49:37,000 --> 01:49:39,000
Engineers tools.

1427
01:49:39,000 --> 01:49:44,000
When throwing a grenade, there's a 15% chance that it won't be consumed.

1428
01:49:44,000 --> 01:49:48,000
Hold on a second.

1429
01:49:48,000 --> 01:49:56,000
Happy New Year to all of you central time zone people.

1430
01:49:56,000 --> 01:50:04,000
There was a blue trinket right above it.

1431
01:50:04,000 --> 01:50:08,000
What does that do?

1432
01:50:08,000 --> 01:50:12,000
Engineers tools.

1433
01:50:12,000 --> 01:50:16,000
I can just equip it.

1434
01:50:16,000 --> 01:50:21,000
So what is the trait?

1435
01:50:21,000 --> 01:50:25,000
I have to unlock that?

1436
01:50:25,000 --> 01:50:28,000
No, I guess I don't.

1437
01:50:28,000 --> 01:50:32,000
That's kind of cool.

1438
01:50:32,000 --> 01:50:36,000
Can I upgrade it?

1439
01:50:36,000 --> 01:50:43,000
What news?

1440
01:50:43,000 --> 01:50:50,000
I guess you can't upgrade because it's already there.

1441
01:50:50,000 --> 01:50:57,000
You can equip the trait.

1442
01:50:57,000 --> 01:51:00,000
Tools of the trade.

1443
01:51:00,000 --> 01:51:04,000
That's kind of cool.

1444
01:51:04,000 --> 01:51:09,000
That means that there's a more...

1445
01:51:09,000 --> 01:51:16,000
Most of the time when you throw a grenade, it's randomly sometimes it's not going to get consumed.

1446
01:51:16,000 --> 01:51:19,000
But that means it doesn't really matter.

1447
01:51:19,000 --> 01:51:23,000
That's my favorite Tarantino movie besides Pulp Viction because that one's too easy.

1448
01:51:23,000 --> 01:51:28,000
We talked about this the other day, like ranking Tarantino movies.

1449
01:51:28,000 --> 01:51:30,000
I don't know.

1450
01:51:30,000 --> 01:51:33,000
It's hard to say.

1451
01:51:33,000 --> 01:51:38,000
But was trying to think of like...

1452
01:51:38,000 --> 01:51:41,000
The first kill bill was pretty cool.

1453
01:51:41,000 --> 01:51:49,000
The whole kill bill was interesting.

1454
01:51:49,000 --> 01:52:01,000
I need to look at like a list of like all the Quentin Tarantino movies he's directed and produced.

1455
01:52:01,000 --> 01:52:09,000
Reservoir Dogs is an easy one to say too, but probably Reservoir Dogs or Kill Bill.

1456
01:52:09,000 --> 01:52:26,000
Alright, it's Alex, you want to play a video game maybe?

1457
01:52:26,000 --> 01:52:33,000
Yeah, you are.

1458
01:52:33,000 --> 01:52:37,000
I liked the hateful 8, man.

1459
01:52:37,000 --> 01:52:40,000
I thought the hateful 8 was like one of the better movies.

1460
01:52:40,000 --> 01:52:42,000
I like the whole...

1461
01:52:42,000 --> 01:52:45,000
I'm not going to talk about plot points.

1462
01:52:45,000 --> 01:52:51,000
But that whole movie just like how it's like, oh you got these 8 people and they're all different people.

1463
01:52:51,000 --> 01:52:53,000
They're all up their own stories.

1464
01:52:53,000 --> 01:52:56,000
Who the good guys are?

1465
01:52:56,000 --> 01:52:57,000
Who the bad guys?

1466
01:52:57,000 --> 01:52:58,000
I like that dynamic.

1467
01:52:58,000 --> 01:53:06,000
It's very interesting.

1468
01:53:06,000 --> 01:53:07,000
I like Kurt Russell.

1469
01:53:07,000 --> 01:53:11,000
I like Samuel Jackson.

1470
01:53:11,000 --> 01:53:12,000
That's just a good movie.

1471
01:53:12,000 --> 01:53:14,000
I recommend you see it.

1472
01:53:21,000 --> 01:53:27,000
Okay, it was a...

1473
01:53:27,000 --> 01:53:30,000
Not to me, just very briefly.

1474
01:53:30,000 --> 01:53:36,000
Do this.

1475
01:53:36,000 --> 01:53:40,000
Uh, Alex, can you invite me to a game?

1476
01:53:40,000 --> 01:53:42,000
Well, we uh...

1477
01:53:42,000 --> 01:53:44,000
Turn out dog cam?

1478
01:53:44,000 --> 01:53:49,000
We're going to do dog cam while Alex invites me to a video game.

1479
01:53:49,000 --> 01:53:51,000
Okay, guys, you ready for the...

1480
01:53:51,000 --> 01:53:52,000
Oh, he's like sleeping, dude.

1481
01:53:52,000 --> 01:53:54,000
This is going to be really cute.

1482
01:53:54,000 --> 01:53:55,000
There you go.

1483
01:53:55,000 --> 01:53:58,000
He's asleep.

1484
01:53:58,000 --> 01:53:59,000
There he is.

1485
01:53:59,000 --> 01:54:01,000
Sleeping.

1486
01:54:01,000 --> 01:54:06,000
Uh, invite me to a game, Alex, if you can.

1487
01:54:06,000 --> 01:54:14,000
Well, we see Otto, the sleepy dog.

1488
01:54:14,000 --> 01:54:16,000
My fan of clue, yes.

1489
01:54:16,000 --> 01:54:24,000
That is a great movie.

1490
01:54:24,000 --> 01:54:25,000
Look at how he's just...

1491
01:54:25,000 --> 01:54:29,000
He's like a little blanky dog.

1492
01:54:29,000 --> 01:54:31,000
Oh, hold on.

1493
01:54:31,000 --> 01:54:32,000
Uh, he's going to hide now.

1494
01:54:32,000 --> 01:54:35,000
The good men before are do so now.

1495
01:54:35,000 --> 01:54:41,000
The metal table will show you our current situation.

1496
01:54:41,000 --> 01:54:43,000
He's going to hide.

1497
01:54:43,000 --> 01:54:45,000
See, he does that in bed too.

1498
01:54:45,000 --> 01:54:47,000
Like, he sleeps in my bed with me.

1499
01:54:47,000 --> 01:54:51,000
And he just stuffs into the covers and just sleeps under the covers of me.

1500
01:54:51,000 --> 01:54:52,000
He's a great dog.

1501
01:54:52,000 --> 01:54:54,000
I'm so glad he's okay.

1502
01:54:54,000 --> 01:54:55,000
He's a good boy.

1503
01:54:55,000 --> 01:54:57,000
My name is Otto.

1504
01:54:57,000 --> 01:55:03,000
Uh, Alex, do you want to speak on the internet telephone?

1505
01:55:03,000 --> 01:55:06,000
Would you want to do that for like a round or two?

1506
01:55:06,000 --> 01:55:07,000
It's up to you.

1507
01:55:07,000 --> 01:55:12,000
You write in the chat if you want to speak on the internet telephone for like an hour.

1508
01:55:12,000 --> 01:55:22,000
I will join the internet telephone if you want me to.

1509
01:55:22,000 --> 01:55:33,000
Okay, he's currently in the internet telephone.

1510
01:55:33,000 --> 01:55:35,000
Uh, here we go.

1511
01:55:35,000 --> 01:55:38,000
Uh, I don't know if people can hear you or not.

1512
01:55:38,000 --> 01:55:43,000
Yeah.

1513
01:55:43,000 --> 01:55:47,000
Hey, I'm happy new year, dude.

1514
01:55:47,000 --> 01:55:50,000
It's just 1207.

1515
01:55:50,000 --> 01:55:51,000
You're time.

1516
01:55:51,000 --> 01:55:55,000
Yeah.

1517
01:55:55,000 --> 01:55:58,000
Uh, you should know people should be able to hear you.

1518
01:55:58,000 --> 01:55:59,000
Dude, happy new year.

1519
01:55:59,000 --> 01:56:01,000
Good.

1520
01:56:01,000 --> 01:56:02,000
Happy new year.

1521
01:56:02,000 --> 01:56:03,000
Welcome to the new.

1522
01:56:03,000 --> 01:56:06,000
Oh, now, now I've got to get used to writing 2016.

1523
01:56:06,000 --> 01:56:08,000
That's the new joke.

1524
01:56:08,000 --> 01:56:09,000
Shut up.

1525
01:56:09,000 --> 01:56:11,000
Shut up with that.

1526
01:56:11,000 --> 01:56:15,000
I got to lower you a little bit, I think.

1527
01:56:15,000 --> 01:56:18,000
Where are you?

1528
01:56:18,000 --> 01:56:19,000
The hell are you?

1529
01:56:19,000 --> 01:56:21,000
Say some words.

1530
01:56:21,000 --> 01:56:22,000
Hey, everybody.

1531
01:56:22,000 --> 01:56:23,000
What's going on?

1532
01:56:23,000 --> 01:56:24,000
My name is German 95.

1533
01:56:24,000 --> 01:56:25,000
We're with the team.

1534
01:56:25,000 --> 01:56:26,000
Gameplay commentary.

1535
01:56:26,000 --> 01:56:27,000
He's gone.

1536
01:56:27,000 --> 01:56:29,000
Yeah, you're good.

1537
01:56:29,000 --> 01:56:31,000
You're good.

1538
01:56:31,000 --> 01:56:35,000
Okay, let's go back to reality here.

1539
01:56:35,000 --> 01:56:37,000
Um, what?

1540
01:56:37,000 --> 01:56:40,000
What would you like to do?

1541
01:56:40,000 --> 01:56:42,000
Um, doesn't matter to me.

1542
01:56:42,000 --> 01:56:44,000
I want to play.

1543
01:56:44,000 --> 01:56:48,000
I would play as high star.

1544
01:56:48,000 --> 01:56:52,000
Oh, I'm going to be witch on her.

1545
01:56:52,000 --> 01:56:55,000
Salt spire.

1546
01:56:55,000 --> 01:57:00,000
What a mission have you not done?

1547
01:57:00,000 --> 01:57:02,000
I've only done two or three.

1548
01:57:02,000 --> 01:57:05,000
So like there's ten.

1549
01:57:05,000 --> 01:57:08,000
I have not done smugglers run.

1550
01:57:08,000 --> 01:57:11,000
Or black powder.

1551
01:57:11,000 --> 01:57:15,000
Really?

1552
01:57:15,000 --> 01:57:16,000
So take your pick.

1553
01:57:16,000 --> 01:57:18,000
I would do.

1554
01:57:18,000 --> 01:57:20,000
Either one of those is good.

1555
01:57:20,000 --> 01:57:23,000
Whatever one you feel like doing.

1556
01:57:23,000 --> 01:57:29,000
Let's give black powder a try.

1557
01:57:29,000 --> 01:57:31,000
Do you want to go ahead and begin?

1558
01:57:31,000 --> 01:57:34,000
Or do you want to wait?

1559
01:57:34,000 --> 01:57:36,000
Uh, those are the guys that were playing.

1560
01:57:36,000 --> 01:57:38,000
If you guys queue up from black pub.

1561
01:57:38,000 --> 01:57:39,000
Difficulty easy.

1562
01:57:39,000 --> 01:57:40,000
Sorry.

1563
01:57:40,000 --> 01:57:42,000
This one is just baby time.

1564
01:57:42,000 --> 01:57:46,000
I'm going to take a toy for you.

1565
01:57:46,000 --> 01:57:49,000
Hey, usually I'm not the one that chews for this.

1566
01:57:49,000 --> 01:57:50,000
I can use to it.

1567
01:57:50,000 --> 01:57:51,000
What the crap is that?

1568
01:57:51,000 --> 01:57:53,000
This is my fucking baby discellphone.

1569
01:57:53,000 --> 01:57:54,000
Take on me Elmo.

1570
01:57:54,000 --> 01:57:57,000
Listen.

1571
01:57:58,000 --> 01:57:59,000
Good night.

1572
01:57:59,000 --> 01:58:01,000
Uh, messy.

1573
01:58:01,000 --> 01:58:04,000
There. Is that better?

1574
01:58:04,000 --> 01:58:08,000
Yeah, we'll do normal. That's fine.

1575
01:58:08,000 --> 01:58:11,000
Do you want to do hard?

1576
01:58:11,000 --> 01:58:13,000
Do you want to do hard?

1577
01:58:13,000 --> 01:58:14,000
It's up to you.

1578
01:58:14,000 --> 01:58:15,000
I don't know.

1579
01:58:15,000 --> 01:58:17,000
Is that like a you normally do hard?

1580
01:58:17,000 --> 01:58:20,000
I'll do whatever you normally do hard.

1581
01:58:20,000 --> 01:58:22,000
Let's make it hard.

1582
01:58:22,000 --> 01:58:23,000
Okay.

1583
01:58:23,000 --> 01:58:25,000
Which one has these, uh, you can use these two guns.

1584
01:58:25,000 --> 01:58:28,000
I go bang bang bang bang.

1585
01:58:28,000 --> 01:58:30,000
He's very quick with his shooting.

1586
01:58:30,000 --> 01:58:32,000
And he's got the pilgrim hat.

1587
01:58:32,000 --> 01:58:36,000
Yes, I think he's my favorite voice character.

1588
01:58:36,000 --> 01:58:38,000
But it's like how he talks.

1589
01:58:38,000 --> 01:58:43,000
Let's go and save the kingdom.

1590
01:58:43,000 --> 01:58:48,000
I actually kind of want to try the wizard again.

1591
01:58:48,000 --> 01:58:49,000
Wizard's fun.

1592
01:58:49,000 --> 01:58:50,000
It's just hard.

1593
01:58:50,000 --> 01:58:51,000
I don't know.

1594
01:58:51,000 --> 01:58:52,000
It's hard to play.

1595
01:58:52,000 --> 01:58:58,000
I want to try the new electric.

1596
01:58:58,000 --> 01:58:59,000
There we go.

1597
01:58:59,000 --> 01:59:01,000
I guess I'm going to join it.

1598
01:59:01,000 --> 01:59:04,000
Yeah, if you're currently playing the game and you'd like to play just

1599
01:59:04,000 --> 01:59:07,000
queue up for black powder hard.

1600
01:59:07,000 --> 01:59:10,000
I'm sure it's in the server browser as well.

1601
01:59:10,000 --> 01:59:14,000
So it's the one with two or three people in it right now.

1602
01:59:14,000 --> 01:59:18,000
He's great.

1603
01:59:18,000 --> 01:59:21,000
I love all the voices in the game.

1604
01:59:21,000 --> 01:59:22,000
They're great.

1605
01:59:22,000 --> 01:59:23,000
Can you do like voice commands?

1606
01:59:23,000 --> 01:59:24,000
How do you do emotes?

1607
01:59:24,000 --> 01:59:25,000
I don't know.

1608
01:59:25,000 --> 01:59:26,000
I don't think you can.

1609
01:59:26,000 --> 01:59:27,000
I think they just kind of do it whenever they feel like it.

1610
01:59:27,000 --> 01:59:35,000
Uh, uh, maybe there was just like a this way or.

1611
01:59:35,000 --> 01:59:43,000
All right, we ready to go.

1612
01:59:43,000 --> 01:59:44,000
Kiss me.

1613
01:59:44,000 --> 01:59:45,000
It's been like, they're a missile toad.

1614
01:59:45,000 --> 01:59:47,000
They already passed the missile toad time.

1615
01:59:47,000 --> 01:59:48,000
Missile toad.

1616
01:59:48,000 --> 01:59:49,000
This is not.

1617
01:59:49,000 --> 01:59:51,000
Christmas, man.

1618
01:59:51,000 --> 01:59:56,000
I also like when you swing the sword how you kind of stop in mid-air and you.

1619
01:59:56,000 --> 02:00:04,000
Yeah, I'm ready to go.

1620
02:00:04,000 --> 02:00:06,000
Yeah, I'm.

1621
02:00:06,000 --> 02:00:07,000
This game, not this game.

1622
02:00:07,000 --> 02:00:13,000
This sword has a lot of stamina on it.

1623
02:00:13,000 --> 02:00:14,000
A lot of stamina on it.

1624
02:00:14,000 --> 02:00:15,000
What does that mean?

1625
02:00:15,000 --> 02:00:17,000
A lot of attacks.

1626
02:00:17,000 --> 02:00:21,000
A lot of shields.

1627
02:00:21,000 --> 02:00:22,000
Yes.

1628
02:00:22,000 --> 02:00:25,000
Which one is this?

1629
02:00:25,000 --> 02:00:29,000
Reaper clone.

1630
02:00:29,000 --> 02:00:31,000
What, uh, what mission is this?

1631
02:00:31,000 --> 02:00:34,000
Black powder, I think.

1632
02:00:34,000 --> 02:00:36,000
On hard mode.

1633
02:00:36,000 --> 02:00:38,000
Oh boy.

1634
02:00:38,000 --> 02:00:41,000
This is my first time on hard mode.

1635
02:00:41,000 --> 02:00:42,000
Oh well.

1636
02:00:42,000 --> 02:00:43,000
I'm going to be gentle.

1637
02:00:43,000 --> 02:00:50,000
You wouldn't you like to know.

1638
02:00:50,000 --> 02:00:51,000
How's that guy already moving?

1639
02:00:51,000 --> 02:00:52,000
Did you just like escape through that?

1640
02:00:52,000 --> 02:00:53,000
I don't know.

1641
02:00:53,000 --> 02:00:57,000
I was like just watching the cutscene.

1642
02:00:57,000 --> 02:00:58,000
Well, I don't want to do one thing real quick.

1643
02:00:58,000 --> 02:00:59,000
Hold on.

1644
02:00:59,000 --> 02:01:00,000
Let me see what happens here.

1645
02:01:00,000 --> 02:01:02,000
If the stream goes down for a second, I apologize.

1646
02:01:02,000 --> 02:01:03,000
Proficially.

1647
02:01:03,000 --> 02:01:05,000
Well, let's see what happens.

1648
02:01:05,000 --> 02:01:08,000
Ladies and gentlemen, the stream might just turn off.

1649
02:01:08,000 --> 02:01:09,000
I will turn it back on though.

1650
02:01:09,000 --> 02:01:10,000
I promise.

1651
02:01:10,000 --> 02:01:12,000
This is a job for the stewardors.

1652
02:01:12,000 --> 02:01:16,000
Why are they never out of work when you need them?

1653
02:01:16,000 --> 02:01:18,000
Did it work?

1654
02:01:18,000 --> 02:01:19,000
Did you just...

1655
02:01:19,000 --> 02:01:24,000
Are we still alive?

1656
02:01:24,000 --> 02:01:25,000
Because I...

1657
02:01:25,000 --> 02:01:28,000
I... I... I put it up to 40 frames a second.

1658
02:01:28,000 --> 02:01:29,000
40?

1659
02:01:29,000 --> 02:01:30,000
Yeah.

1660
02:01:30,000 --> 02:01:31,000
What is that going to look like on stream?

1661
02:01:31,000 --> 02:01:33,000
I've never seen that before.

1662
02:01:33,000 --> 02:01:37,000
Did the frame rate increase?

1663
02:01:37,000 --> 02:01:39,000
Can you not stream this at 60?

1664
02:01:39,000 --> 02:01:40,000
Oh.

1665
02:01:40,000 --> 02:01:45,000
I wonder if that did anything.

1666
02:01:45,000 --> 02:01:46,000
I mean, I probably...

1667
02:01:46,000 --> 02:01:47,000
I could try.

1668
02:01:47,000 --> 02:01:48,000
But I...

1669
02:01:48,000 --> 02:01:50,000
For some reason, I was on 30.

1670
02:01:50,000 --> 02:01:51,000
I don't know why.

1671
02:01:51,000 --> 02:01:53,000
I might have been the last thing I was recording.

1672
02:01:53,000 --> 02:01:54,000
Noisy.

1673
02:01:54,000 --> 02:01:55,000
Just like a dwarf.

1674
02:01:55,000 --> 02:01:56,000
Hmm.

1675
02:01:56,000 --> 02:01:57,000
I don't know.

1676
02:01:57,000 --> 02:01:59,000
I actually want to know what that looks like.

1677
02:01:59,000 --> 02:02:00,000
Wow, 10 more frames.

1678
02:02:00,000 --> 02:02:02,000
I've never seen a 40 frame per second stream.

1679
02:02:02,000 --> 02:02:03,000
This is the first one ever.

1680
02:02:03,000 --> 02:02:04,000
Just a...

1681
02:02:04,000 --> 02:02:06,000
I just didn't know if you could do it like on the fly.

1682
02:02:06,000 --> 02:02:08,000
There's a foam here.

1683
02:02:08,000 --> 02:02:10,000
I need to restart the stream to do the FPS change.

1684
02:02:10,000 --> 02:02:20,000
Oh, I'm going to restart the stream.

1685
02:02:20,000 --> 02:02:21,000
Oh, whatever.

1686
02:02:21,000 --> 02:02:22,000
Who cares?

1687
02:02:22,000 --> 02:02:23,000
So, on this...

1688
02:02:23,000 --> 02:02:24,000
Is this like the whole mission right here?

1689
02:02:24,000 --> 02:02:26,000
Yes, this is the whole mission.

1690
02:02:26,000 --> 02:02:37,000
So, if you have any experience with using the bolt staff,

1691
02:02:37,000 --> 02:02:39,000
the bolt staff...

1692
02:02:39,000 --> 02:02:41,000
Zero.

1693
02:02:41,000 --> 02:02:45,000
Because the default basic attack seems like kind of weak.

1694
02:02:45,000 --> 02:02:47,000
What about the charge up?

1695
02:02:47,000 --> 02:02:49,000
Pretty low.

1696
02:02:49,000 --> 02:02:50,000
So, charge up.

1697
02:02:50,000 --> 02:02:51,000
It's been on 30.

1698
02:02:51,000 --> 02:02:52,000
This whole...

1699
02:02:52,000 --> 02:02:53,000
I didn't know it was on 30.

1700
02:02:53,000 --> 02:02:55,000
I usually stream it 40 or 45.

1701
02:02:55,000 --> 02:02:56,000
Has it been bad looking?

1702
02:02:56,000 --> 02:02:57,000
Or has it been just...

1703
02:02:57,000 --> 02:03:01,000
It's somewhat just normal looking?

1704
02:03:01,000 --> 02:03:03,000
Were you watching early?

1705
02:03:03,000 --> 02:03:05,000
I was not watching on source.

1706
02:03:05,000 --> 02:03:09,000
So, I can't really answer that question very well.

1707
02:03:09,000 --> 02:03:13,000
I've been trying to stream when I stream at least 40.

1708
02:03:13,000 --> 02:03:15,000
Wow, why was it a 30?

1709
02:03:15,000 --> 02:03:17,000
I wonder what the hell that was.

1710
02:03:17,000 --> 02:03:23,000
Oh, Jesus.

1711
02:03:27,000 --> 02:03:29,000
Whoa, people behind me.

1712
02:03:36,000 --> 02:03:38,000
You do take fall damage in this game?

1713
02:03:38,000 --> 02:03:39,000
Yes.

1714
02:03:41,000 --> 02:03:43,000
We need to pick up some...

1715
02:03:43,000 --> 02:03:45,000
All right, go on to pick up some barrels.

1716
02:03:45,000 --> 02:03:47,000
I don't want to leave this guy alone.

1717
02:03:47,000 --> 02:03:49,000
There's got tackled, but it's okay.

1718
02:03:49,000 --> 02:03:52,000
I got someone covering me and there's three guards up here though.

1719
02:03:52,000 --> 02:03:54,000
So, that's not good.

1720
02:03:54,000 --> 02:03:56,000
We need to try to get to it at a time.

1721
02:03:59,000 --> 02:04:01,000
There's one up top all the way up top.

1722
02:04:01,000 --> 02:04:04,000
Are you going for the one all the way up top?

1723
02:04:05,000 --> 02:04:06,000
Ow.

1724
02:04:06,000 --> 02:04:08,000
Yeah, but I'm getting a little low.

1725
02:04:11,000 --> 02:04:13,000
All right, I got the one up top.

1726
02:04:16,000 --> 02:04:21,000
Rage and man, yeah, I'm getting pushed around a little bit.

1727
02:04:23,000 --> 02:04:25,000
Is this the first one?

1728
02:04:25,000 --> 02:04:27,000
Is this number one?

1729
02:04:27,000 --> 02:04:29,000
Oh, wow.

1730
02:04:29,000 --> 02:04:31,000
That almost is bad.

1731
02:04:31,000 --> 02:04:32,000
Holy crap.

1732
02:04:32,000 --> 02:04:33,000
And a tank.

1733
02:04:33,000 --> 02:04:35,000
We have one barrel.

1734
02:04:35,000 --> 02:04:38,000
It's coming after me.

1735
02:04:39,000 --> 02:04:41,000
I can heal you in a second here.

1736
02:04:41,000 --> 02:04:44,000
You know, once we kill this guy.

1737
02:04:46,000 --> 02:04:48,000
I'm guessing jumping in the water is not good.

1738
02:04:48,000 --> 02:04:50,000
No, it's not good.

1739
02:04:50,000 --> 02:04:51,000
All right.

1740
02:04:51,000 --> 02:04:53,000
All right, come over here.

1741
02:04:53,000 --> 02:04:56,000
Are you the right way, is it, right?

1742
02:04:56,000 --> 02:04:57,000
Yes.

1743
02:04:59,000 --> 02:05:01,000
Well, I didn't go off because I got it.

1744
02:05:03,000 --> 02:05:05,000
What must you be doing?

1745
02:05:05,000 --> 02:05:07,000
Hey, there we go.

1746
02:05:07,000 --> 02:05:08,000
Thank you.

1747
02:05:16,000 --> 02:05:19,000
Trying not to suck.

1748
02:05:19,000 --> 02:05:21,000
Is there any?

1749
02:05:21,000 --> 02:05:23,000
Even the sound cues are coming like leopardhood.

1750
02:05:23,000 --> 02:05:26,000
Yeah, that's actually one of the things I like about it.

1751
02:05:26,000 --> 02:05:30,000
Because it feels sort of familiar, but still unique.

1752
02:05:31,000 --> 02:05:34,000
Yeah, it's very, very familiar, but it's still fun.

1753
02:05:40,000 --> 02:05:42,000
How many do we have to it at 33 to 43?

1754
02:05:42,000 --> 02:05:43,000
3 to 8?

1755
02:05:43,000 --> 02:05:45,000
Uh, uh, get away from me.

1756
02:05:45,000 --> 02:05:48,000
Get away from me.

1757
02:05:52,000 --> 02:05:55,000
How the fuck did you get over there?

1758
02:05:56,000 --> 02:05:59,000
I hear an assassin and I'm terrified right now.

1759
02:05:59,000 --> 02:06:01,000
I need to come over to you guys.

1760
02:06:01,000 --> 02:06:04,000
He jumped right past you and then down.

1761
02:06:04,000 --> 02:06:05,000
Yeah, he's right.

1762
02:06:05,000 --> 02:06:06,000
No, not past you.

1763
02:06:06,000 --> 02:06:07,000
He jumped past the barrel guy.

1764
02:06:07,000 --> 02:06:10,000
He's still alive.

1765
02:06:10,000 --> 02:06:11,000
More to 8.

1766
02:06:11,000 --> 02:06:12,000
I need help.

1767
02:06:12,000 --> 02:06:13,000
I need help.

1768
02:06:13,000 --> 02:06:16,000
Yeah, they're on the other side.

1769
02:06:16,000 --> 02:06:20,000
I'm going to die.

1770
02:06:20,000 --> 02:06:23,000
Oh, dear.

1771
02:06:24,000 --> 02:06:26,000
You're more.

1772
02:06:26,000 --> 02:06:28,000
I'm done.

1773
02:06:28,000 --> 02:06:31,000
Those people are by themselves.

1774
02:06:31,000 --> 02:06:32,000
I'm having to try.

1775
02:06:32,000 --> 02:06:33,000
So hard right now.

1776
02:06:33,000 --> 02:06:36,000
Yeah, this is hard.

1777
02:06:36,000 --> 02:06:38,000
I should have healed myself.

1778
02:06:38,000 --> 02:06:40,000
I shouldn't have given it to you.

1779
02:06:40,000 --> 02:06:41,000
I should have taken it.

1780
02:06:41,000 --> 02:06:44,000
I should have ate the fucking cupcake.

1781
02:06:44,000 --> 02:06:48,000
All right, we need to bake our way over there.

1782
02:06:48,000 --> 02:06:49,000
Yep.

1783
02:06:49,000 --> 02:06:50,000
There's the assassin right here.

1784
02:06:50,000 --> 02:06:52,000
The problem is I don't stone on the animals.

1785
02:06:52,000 --> 02:06:53,000
I haven't played this.

1786
02:06:53,000 --> 02:06:55,000
This is like only the second and third time.

1787
02:06:55,000 --> 02:06:56,000
There was ammo on this side.

1788
02:06:56,000 --> 02:06:58,000
It's top floor.

1789
02:06:58,000 --> 02:06:59,000
All right, who wants to make the trip?

1790
02:06:59,000 --> 02:07:00,000
We're making the trip.

1791
02:07:00,000 --> 02:07:02,000
This is bad to be split up like this.

1792
02:07:02,000 --> 02:07:04,000
Oh, come on.

1793
02:07:04,000 --> 02:07:05,000
Where are you?

1794
02:07:05,000 --> 02:07:06,000
Please, nobody's snuck me.

1795
02:07:06,000 --> 02:07:07,000
Don't pick me off.

1796
02:07:07,000 --> 02:07:09,000
You're on the wrong side.

1797
02:07:09,000 --> 02:07:11,000
Wait, I'm on.

1798
02:07:11,000 --> 02:07:13,000
What made like from the ammo?

1799
02:07:13,000 --> 02:07:15,000
An ammo is on this side.

1800
02:07:15,000 --> 02:07:16,000
I'm at the barrels.

1801
02:07:16,000 --> 02:07:19,000
Although, what's in here?

1802
02:07:19,000 --> 02:07:20,000
Oh, yeah.

1803
02:07:20,000 --> 02:07:23,000
All kinds of shit in here.

1804
02:07:23,000 --> 02:07:27,000
The ammo and air as well.

1805
02:07:27,000 --> 02:07:38,000
You don't have any ammo, but...

1806
02:07:38,000 --> 02:07:44,000
Bolt staff is an awful lot like just being a character in Dragon Ballsy.

1807
02:07:44,000 --> 02:07:49,000
I don't want to accidentally shoot with the tank.

1808
02:07:50,000 --> 02:07:53,000
Oh, you got a lot of people behind you.

1809
02:07:53,000 --> 02:07:54,000
Yeah.

1810
02:07:54,000 --> 02:07:56,000
That's accurate.

1811
02:07:56,000 --> 02:07:59,000
Only two more and we win.

1812
02:07:59,000 --> 02:08:00,000
One up top.

1813
02:08:00,000 --> 02:08:01,000
Come with me.

1814
02:08:01,000 --> 02:08:02,000
We're going to get the one up top.

1815
02:08:02,000 --> 02:08:03,000
They can get the one up.

1816
02:08:03,000 --> 02:08:05,000
Yeah.

1817
02:08:05,000 --> 02:08:07,000
We'll go get the one at the very top.

1818
02:08:07,000 --> 02:08:08,000
I followed the wrong view.

1819
02:08:08,000 --> 02:08:10,000
This is not the only exit.

1820
02:08:10,000 --> 02:08:11,000
Oh, boy.

1821
02:08:11,000 --> 02:08:13,000
Am I by myself right now?

1822
02:08:13,000 --> 02:08:14,000
Alex.

1823
02:08:14,000 --> 02:08:15,000
Why did you find myself?

1824
02:08:15,000 --> 02:08:16,000
I got myself.

1825
02:08:16,000 --> 02:08:23,000
This tap isn't really just not good.

1826
02:08:23,000 --> 02:08:24,000
One barrel.

1827
02:08:24,000 --> 02:08:26,000
I'm going to go up.

1828
02:08:26,000 --> 02:08:30,000
I'm by the barrel, but I'm scared of dying.

1829
02:08:30,000 --> 02:08:32,000
Actually, how do you get up there?

1830
02:08:32,000 --> 02:08:33,000
I don't know.

1831
02:08:33,000 --> 02:08:35,000
I can throw it down.

1832
02:08:35,000 --> 02:08:36,000
Oh, I'll watch out.

1833
02:08:36,000 --> 02:08:39,000
There's a fucking machine gunner.

1834
02:08:39,000 --> 02:08:41,000
I'm going to toss this down to you.

1835
02:08:41,000 --> 02:08:42,000
Hold on.

1836
02:08:42,000 --> 02:08:43,000
Don't do that yet.

1837
02:08:43,000 --> 02:08:44,000
Machine gunner.

1838
02:08:45,000 --> 02:08:47,000
I'm stuck.

1839
02:08:47,000 --> 02:08:48,000
I'm in this wall.

1840
02:08:48,000 --> 02:08:49,000
Holy shit.

1841
02:08:54,000 --> 02:08:56,000
It's explode on you.

1842
02:08:56,000 --> 02:08:58,000
Oh, I heard a bad spot.

1843
02:08:58,000 --> 02:09:01,000
No, I'm unreachable.

1844
02:09:01,000 --> 02:09:03,000
I just heard an explosion.

1845
02:09:03,000 --> 02:09:05,000
I am unreachable right now.

1846
02:09:05,000 --> 02:09:07,000
I'm on this little way.

1847
02:09:07,000 --> 02:09:08,000
I might be able to get you.

1848
02:09:08,000 --> 02:09:10,000
I might be able to get you.

1849
02:09:10,000 --> 02:09:11,000
Is it easy, Dad?

1850
02:09:11,000 --> 02:09:13,000
We might be able to just look up there.

1851
02:09:13,000 --> 02:09:16,000
It's the one rat hitting me right now.

1852
02:09:16,000 --> 02:09:17,000
Good luck.

1853
02:09:17,000 --> 02:09:20,000
Doth butt crust just subscribed.

1854
02:09:20,000 --> 02:09:23,000
Hey, Doth butt crust.

1855
02:09:23,000 --> 02:09:25,000
The most powerful sith, Lord.

1856
02:09:25,000 --> 02:09:27,000
In the whole galaxy.

1857
02:09:27,000 --> 02:09:30,000
Yeah, we're falling to pieces right now.

1858
02:09:30,000 --> 02:09:33,000
As long as we get this last one, it will be fine.

1859
02:09:33,000 --> 02:09:36,000
We just often move with it.

1860
02:09:36,000 --> 02:09:41,000
What you're going to give the team moral support?

1861
02:09:41,000 --> 02:09:44,000
You buy yourself at the moment.

1862
02:09:44,000 --> 02:09:51,000
You're currently trying to not take any hits.

1863
02:09:51,000 --> 02:09:53,000
Hit with me, Nidah.

1864
02:09:53,000 --> 02:09:55,000
All right, we're going to get it.

1865
02:09:55,000 --> 02:09:59,000
We're going to get it.

1866
02:09:59,000 --> 02:10:00,000
Set free.

1867
02:10:00,000 --> 02:10:04,000
Can I get you?

1868
02:10:04,000 --> 02:10:05,000
I'm going to try to get you.

1869
02:10:05,000 --> 02:10:06,000
Possibly.

1870
02:10:06,000 --> 02:10:08,000
I think I'm going to get you.

1871
02:10:08,000 --> 02:10:09,000
Uh oh.

1872
02:10:09,000 --> 02:10:11,000
Please, please, please, please.

1873
02:10:11,000 --> 02:10:12,000
Please do not hurt me here.

1874
02:10:12,000 --> 02:10:13,000
Come on, come on, come on, come on.

1875
02:10:13,000 --> 02:10:14,000
Do not.

1876
02:10:14,000 --> 02:10:15,000
It's coming.

1877
02:10:15,000 --> 02:10:16,000
What?

1878
02:10:16,000 --> 02:10:17,000
What happened?

1879
02:10:17,000 --> 02:10:18,000
I'm up.

1880
02:10:18,000 --> 02:10:19,000
I rescued you two times.

1881
02:10:19,000 --> 02:10:20,000
That's weird.

1882
02:10:20,000 --> 02:10:22,000
But the hoard is here on top of us.

1883
02:10:22,000 --> 02:10:23,000
Run.

1884
02:10:23,000 --> 02:10:25,000
Just get on the boat.

1885
02:10:25,000 --> 02:10:27,000
Get on the boat.

1886
02:10:27,000 --> 02:10:28,000
I can't.

1887
02:10:28,000 --> 02:10:30,000
Oh, she's.

1888
02:10:30,000 --> 02:10:35,000
Bring the potion.

1889
02:10:35,000 --> 02:10:36,000
Get on the boat.

1890
02:10:36,000 --> 02:10:37,000
Jump down.

1891
02:10:37,000 --> 02:10:39,000
Do you have any?

1892
02:10:39,000 --> 02:10:40,000
I'm coming.

1893
02:10:40,000 --> 02:10:41,000
Hold on.

1894
02:10:41,000 --> 02:10:42,000
Get on the boat.

1895
02:10:42,000 --> 02:10:44,000
Leave him.

1896
02:10:44,000 --> 02:10:45,000
I'm here.

1897
02:10:45,000 --> 02:10:46,000
Don't leave me.

1898
02:10:46,000 --> 02:10:50,000
Yeah, nice job.

1899
02:10:50,000 --> 02:10:51,000
Oh, thanks.

1900
02:10:51,000 --> 02:10:53,000
Special thanks to Darth Buckrust.

1901
02:10:53,000 --> 02:10:54,000
So you went left.

1902
02:10:54,000 --> 02:10:55,000
I went right.

1903
02:10:55,000 --> 02:11:00,000
And if you go right, there was just like a walled off wooder and planks.

1904
02:11:00,000 --> 02:11:04,000
So I just like got into a dead end, basically.

1905
02:11:04,000 --> 02:11:06,000
Thanks for saving my life, guys.

1906
02:11:06,000 --> 02:11:07,000
Ooh.

1907
02:11:07,000 --> 02:11:09,000
That's a gun that's a legendary.

1908
02:11:09,000 --> 02:11:10,000
Come on.

1909
02:11:10,000 --> 02:11:11,000
All face up.

1910
02:11:11,000 --> 02:11:12,000
Shit.

1911
02:11:12,000 --> 02:11:15,000
Come on.

1912
02:11:15,000 --> 02:11:19,000
One more and I would have got a blue.

1913
02:11:19,000 --> 02:11:22,000
It's a staff.

1914
02:11:22,000 --> 02:11:24,000
Hard mode was the right call.

1915
02:11:24,000 --> 02:11:30,000
It was too tough for a poor old me, but still good.

1916
02:11:30,000 --> 02:11:32,000
Hey, I got a, is it a trinket?

1917
02:11:32,000 --> 02:11:33,000
Is my first trinket?

1918
02:11:33,000 --> 02:11:34,000
Yeah.

1919
02:11:34,000 --> 02:11:35,000
They have random effects.

1920
02:11:35,000 --> 02:11:40,000
So it can be like, oh, you're just a 20% chance that you're 2% move speed.

1921
02:11:40,000 --> 02:11:41,000
Oh.

1922
02:11:41,000 --> 02:11:45,000
Let's go back to the end.

1923
02:11:45,000 --> 02:11:47,000
2% move speed.

1924
02:11:47,000 --> 02:11:48,000
Yeah.

1925
02:11:48,000 --> 02:11:50,000
That doesn't sound like much.

1926
02:11:50,000 --> 02:11:51,000
Maybe.

1927
02:11:51,000 --> 02:11:55,000
I can just outrun you guys now so they'll attack you first.

1928
02:11:55,000 --> 02:11:57,000
Was it a green or was it a blue?

1929
02:11:57,000 --> 02:11:58,000
Green.

1930
02:11:58,000 --> 02:11:59,000
I'm assuming there's probably a blue version.

1931
02:11:59,000 --> 02:12:00,000
That's 5%.

1932
02:12:00,000 --> 02:12:01,000
Maybe.

1933
02:12:01,000 --> 02:12:02,000
I don't know.

1934
02:12:02,000 --> 02:12:03,000
Yeah, that would be pretty nice.

1935
02:12:03,000 --> 02:12:04,000
5% would actually be noticeable.

1936
02:12:04,000 --> 02:12:11,000
2% is just, you don't know if it's lag or if you're actually moving faster.

1937
02:12:11,000 --> 02:12:12,000
There is no campaign mode.

1938
02:12:12,000 --> 02:12:13,000
I mean, no.

1939
02:12:13,000 --> 02:12:20,000
Yeah, but what we're doing, there's no versus mode is only campaign.

1940
02:12:20,000 --> 02:12:23,000
Busted.

1941
02:12:23,000 --> 02:12:27,000
I feel like they were probably convinced they couldn't do a perfect balanced versus mode.

1942
02:12:27,000 --> 02:12:32,000
If you can't get a balance, then it's better just not to include it.

1943
02:12:32,000 --> 02:12:34,000
Yeah, that's probably true.

1944
02:12:34,000 --> 02:12:37,000
That's true.

1945
02:12:37,000 --> 02:12:47,000
I can probably craft down some shit.

1946
02:12:47,000 --> 02:12:56,000
Actually, I kind of want to play.

1947
02:12:56,000 --> 02:13:00,000
Look at how many people that hits just with a default normal swing.

1948
02:13:00,000 --> 02:13:01,000
That's kind of insane.

1949
02:13:01,000 --> 02:13:06,000
It does like no damage, but that is pretty damn cool.

1950
02:13:06,000 --> 02:13:09,000
You can just clear people out with it.

1951
02:13:09,000 --> 02:13:10,000
Craft it.

1952
02:13:10,000 --> 02:13:11,000
All right.

1953
02:13:11,000 --> 02:13:13,000
I'm going to try this staff instead.

1954
02:13:13,000 --> 02:13:17,000
I think it's going to go better.

1955
02:13:17,000 --> 02:13:21,000
I don't even like, I don't even keep fucking craft it.

1956
02:13:21,000 --> 02:13:23,000
I don't even care.

1957
02:13:23,000 --> 02:13:29,000
The only one I haven't done is smuggler's run.

1958
02:13:29,000 --> 02:13:32,000
Have you done that one recently?

1959
02:13:32,000 --> 02:13:35,000
Much earlier, I think.

1960
02:13:35,000 --> 02:13:36,000
I don't know.

1961
02:13:36,000 --> 02:13:40,000
It was one other you would rather play.

1962
02:13:40,000 --> 02:13:41,000
I would rather.

1963
02:13:41,000 --> 02:13:47,000
Your options are Horn of Magnus, Supply and Demand or Wizard's Tower again.

1964
02:13:47,000 --> 02:13:49,000
Lab.

1965
02:13:49,000 --> 02:13:51,000
Or smuggler's run.

1966
02:13:51,000 --> 02:13:53,000
Which I haven't in my item.

1967
02:13:53,000 --> 02:13:55,000
What's going on here?

1968
02:13:55,000 --> 02:13:57,000
Did you just like, did I eat it?

1969
02:13:57,000 --> 02:13:59,000
I didn't even get an item.

1970
02:13:59,000 --> 02:14:01,000
I didn't even get anything.

1971
02:14:01,000 --> 02:14:05,000
I just wasted what the fuck was that?

1972
02:14:05,000 --> 02:14:06,000
Okay.

1973
02:14:06,000 --> 02:14:09,000
Well, there goes 50 green gems.

1974
02:14:09,000 --> 02:14:12,000
Just took stolen from me.

1975
02:14:12,000 --> 02:14:13,000
Oh, geez.

1976
02:14:13,000 --> 02:14:14,000
Hold on.

1977
02:14:14,000 --> 02:14:17,000
Did it just not show?

1978
02:14:17,000 --> 02:14:19,000
Did I have this before?

1979
02:14:19,000 --> 02:14:21,000
I don't think I had this before.

1980
02:14:21,000 --> 02:14:23,000
I think I just forgot to show it to you.

1981
02:14:23,000 --> 02:14:25,000
I don't know.

1982
02:14:25,000 --> 02:14:28,000
I don't know.

1983
02:14:28,000 --> 02:14:30,000
I don't think I had this before.

1984
02:14:30,000 --> 02:14:39,000
I think this is new.

1985
02:14:39,000 --> 02:14:40,000
I don't know.

1986
02:14:40,000 --> 02:14:44,000
I'm going to try it though, because it's really fast.

1987
02:14:50,000 --> 02:14:53,000
We set up that torch for you, Loh.

1988
02:14:58,000 --> 02:15:00,000
Goddamnit.

1989
02:15:00,000 --> 02:15:01,000
10%.

1990
02:15:01,000 --> 02:15:03,000
It's so bad.

1991
02:15:03,000 --> 02:15:06,000
Oh.

1992
02:15:06,000 --> 02:15:10,000
Oh, well.

1993
02:15:10,000 --> 02:15:14,000
This is really fast.

1994
02:15:14,000 --> 02:15:15,000
And I can shoot.

1995
02:15:15,000 --> 02:15:17,000
Okay, I'm ready.

1996
02:15:18,000 --> 02:15:19,000
All right.

1997
02:15:19,000 --> 02:15:20,000
Oops.

1998
02:15:20,000 --> 02:15:24,000
I may have just hit the cancel button.

1999
02:15:24,000 --> 02:15:26,000
Oh, I hate you.

2000
02:15:26,000 --> 02:15:28,000
So hit F2 again.

2001
02:15:28,000 --> 02:15:29,000
You chump.

2002
02:15:35,000 --> 02:15:37,000
Prepare yourself.

2003
02:15:38,000 --> 02:15:41,000
Prepare yourself.

2004
02:15:41,000 --> 02:15:43,000
Carefully.

2005
02:15:46,000 --> 02:15:48,000
All right.

2006
02:15:55,000 --> 02:15:59,000
Prepare yourself.

2007
02:15:59,000 --> 02:16:01,000
Prepare yourself.

2008
02:16:01,000 --> 02:16:02,000
Prepare yourself.

2009
02:16:02,000 --> 02:16:04,000
Prepare yourself.

2010
02:16:04,000 --> 02:16:05,000
An emotional challengersだ.

2011
02:16:05,000 --> 02:16:11,000
here. This delete system 32. Just do that. Just do it and fucking just shit the bed.

2012
02:16:13,000 --> 02:16:15,000
Just reformat your hard drive.

2013
02:16:19,000 --> 02:16:21,000
It pulls you. Stab is fun.

2014
02:16:21,000 --> 02:16:25,000
Oh, city whose roots go unnoted.

2015
02:16:25,000 --> 02:16:28,000
I don't know about the gods, but I certainly approve.

2016
02:16:28,000 --> 02:16:30,000
So is.

2017
02:16:30,000 --> 02:16:32,000
Alright, let's find a bunch of dice.

2018
02:16:33,000 --> 02:16:38,000
We're gonna find all the dice, all the grimmeries, all of the poems.

2019
02:16:40,000 --> 02:16:42,000
It's gonna be great. I don't know if we're gonna do that.

2020
02:16:43,000 --> 02:16:45,000
We're gonna export every nook and cranny.

2021
02:16:46,000 --> 02:16:47,000
Oh, yeah.

2022
02:16:49,000 --> 02:16:50,000
That was odd.

2023
02:16:52,000 --> 02:16:54,000
Happy Valentine's Day. Happy Valentine's Day.

2024
02:16:55,000 --> 02:16:56,000
Happy Earth Day.

2025
02:16:59,000 --> 02:17:00,000
Happy Enchantment Day.

2026
02:17:07,000 --> 02:17:09,000
Hey, how you doing? Happy Enchantment Day.

2027
02:17:09,000 --> 02:17:09,000
Hey, I found a thing.

2028
02:17:10,000 --> 02:17:11,000
Give me a smile. Give me a smile.

2029
02:17:16,000 --> 02:17:17,000
This way would be fast.

2030
02:17:19,000 --> 02:17:25,000
Yeah, this, this staff actually one shot basic rat, which is a big improvement over shooting them six times.

2031
02:17:32,000 --> 02:17:35,000
Dead. I hear guards on the other side of this door.

2032
02:17:35,000 --> 02:17:37,000
Do you do do you?

2033
02:17:38,000 --> 02:17:39,000
Yeah, this way.

2034
02:17:41,000 --> 02:17:43,000
There's something wrong with this door. Everyone's like standing.

2035
02:17:43,000 --> 02:17:45,000
I don't know. I'm scared. I don't want to get hit by the troll.

2036
02:17:46,000 --> 02:17:47,000
We'll get this. We'll get fucking owned.

2037
02:17:48,000 --> 02:17:50,000
We're like, oh, there's a lot of boys.

2038
02:17:52,000 --> 02:17:53,000
We should hide.

2039
02:17:54,000 --> 02:17:56,000
And they're coming up by it. This is very, very great.

2040
02:17:56,000 --> 02:17:58,000
Hide in here. Come over to the right.

2041
02:17:59,000 --> 02:18:00,000
I may have shot them.

2042
02:18:01,000 --> 02:18:02,000
Why are you shooting them?

2043
02:18:02,000 --> 02:18:03,000
Why are you shooting them?

2044
02:18:04,000 --> 02:18:06,000
Oh, goodbye. We're gonna lose this.

2045
02:18:06,000 --> 02:18:07,000
Eat, bomb.

2046
02:18:10,000 --> 02:18:11,000
Get the speed.

2047
02:18:14,000 --> 02:18:15,000
Just gonna hang out of here.

2048
02:18:21,000 --> 02:18:22,000
He watching me.

2049
02:18:23,000 --> 02:18:24,000
I didn't do it.

2050
02:18:26,000 --> 02:18:27,000
What a dummy.

2051
02:18:28,000 --> 02:18:29,000
You are such a dummy.

2052
02:18:29,000 --> 02:18:31,000
We just, you had to rip it off like a bandaid.

2053
02:18:31,000 --> 02:18:33,000
You just had to get it over with.

2054
02:18:34,000 --> 02:18:35,000
You know, what it is is you're lucky.

2055
02:18:36,000 --> 02:18:38,000
What is it? You're lucky that we had two bombs.

2056
02:18:38,000 --> 02:18:40,000
There's a healing trap here.

2057
02:18:40,000 --> 02:18:41,000
Yeah, we're good.

2058
02:18:41,000 --> 02:18:43,000
We had two bombs ago.

2059
02:18:45,000 --> 02:18:47,000
Yeah, but they were put to good use.

2060
02:18:47,000 --> 02:18:47,000
Maybe.

2061
02:18:48,000 --> 02:18:48,000
Maybe.

2062
02:18:54,000 --> 02:18:55,000
We get this guy right in his face.

2063
02:18:57,000 --> 02:18:58,000
Oh, he got his friend in the face.

2064
02:18:59,000 --> 02:18:59,000
There we go.

2065
02:19:10,000 --> 02:19:11,000
Look, it's fun.

2066
02:19:13,000 --> 02:19:14,000
The stab, stab.

2067
02:19:16,000 --> 02:19:17,000
There's a lot of potions over here.

2068
02:19:18,000 --> 02:19:19,000
Is it like a new sword?

2069
02:19:19,000 --> 02:19:19,000
A new sword?

2070
02:19:20,000 --> 02:19:22,000
I'm gonna get like shit faced on these potions.

2071
02:19:22,000 --> 02:19:23,000
Yeah, what's that one?

2072
02:19:23,000 --> 02:19:24,000
I don't know.

2073
02:19:24,000 --> 02:19:25,000
There's got to be a blueberry.

2074
02:19:25,000 --> 02:19:26,000
What's this one?

2075
02:19:26,000 --> 02:19:27,000
Oh, yeah.

2076
02:19:28,000 --> 02:19:29,000
All right, let's go.

2077
02:19:35,000 --> 02:19:37,000
Open the flood gate.

2078
02:19:40,000 --> 02:19:41,000
What is this thing on my screen?

2079
02:19:41,000 --> 02:19:42,000
This isn't left to harm or die.

2080
02:19:43,000 --> 02:19:44,000
Why is it there?

2081
02:19:45,000 --> 02:19:46,000
Is it like a tool tip?

2082
02:19:47,000 --> 02:19:49,000
That's just the, I'm the middle of my screen forever.

2083
02:19:49,000 --> 02:19:51,000
Yeah.

2084
02:20:07,000 --> 02:20:09,000
It's waiting for this giant door to come down.

2085
02:20:15,000 --> 02:20:17,000
When they start crawling down the walls and stuff,

2086
02:20:17,000 --> 02:20:19,000
they really do remind me of like

2087
02:20:19,000 --> 02:20:23,000
the Lord of the Rings or just orcs crawling around everywhere.

2088
02:20:34,000 --> 02:20:36,000
I think everyone's like waiting on you to say that.

2089
02:20:44,000 --> 02:20:46,000
So by conflagration like,

2090
02:20:46,000 --> 02:20:48,000
we just light people on fire for the most part, I guess.

2091
02:20:49,000 --> 02:20:50,000
It seems pretty awesome.

2092
02:20:50,000 --> 02:20:53,000
The fireball one like pretty much instant destroys them.

2093
02:20:53,000 --> 02:20:54,000
This one's more like a dodge.

2094
02:20:58,000 --> 02:20:59,000
What's the, what does it call?

2095
02:20:59,000 --> 02:21:00,000
Is this that one?

2096
02:21:00,000 --> 02:21:01,000
It's a conflagration staff, I think.

2097
02:21:02,000 --> 02:21:03,000
Conflagration.

2098
02:21:06,000 --> 02:21:07,000
See, it's Alex can say where it's wrong too.

2099
02:21:09,000 --> 02:21:10,000
What is it?

2100
02:21:10,000 --> 02:21:11,000
He's in a conflagration.

2101
02:21:12,000 --> 02:21:12,000
Maybe.

2102
02:21:12,000 --> 02:21:15,000
I don't think I ever said that word out loud.

2103
02:21:15,000 --> 02:21:17,000
Oh, no.

2104
02:21:19,000 --> 02:21:20,000
Apparently it's almost dead.

2105
02:21:23,000 --> 02:21:26,000
I seem to get a lot of bullets that I just didn't need to use, but all right, whatever.

2106
02:21:31,000 --> 02:21:32,000
Ooh, a chest.

2107
02:21:33,000 --> 02:21:34,000
What the, what the, nothing.

2108
02:21:34,000 --> 02:21:36,000
Absolutely nothing inside.

2109
02:21:37,000 --> 02:21:38,000
I hate when that happens.

2110
02:21:38,000 --> 02:21:39,000
Yeah, it's annoying.

2111
02:21:39,000 --> 02:21:41,000
I don't know that just like not have a chest.

2112
02:21:42,000 --> 02:21:44,000
He's in the stuff.

2113
02:21:44,000 --> 02:21:46,000
We're blessed.

2114
02:21:49,000 --> 02:21:51,000
Yeah, this much brings my clothes.

2115
02:21:55,000 --> 02:21:56,000
I just, I like like just moving around.

2116
02:21:56,000 --> 02:21:58,000
We get fast to swinging this around like crazy.

2117
02:21:58,000 --> 02:21:59,000
It's definitely, it's great.

2118
02:22:02,000 --> 02:22:03,000
And you can shoot the sidearm.

2119
02:22:04,000 --> 02:22:05,000
Medical supplies.

2120
02:22:07,000 --> 02:22:10,000
This is the eye like a, I found my new favorite item.

2121
02:22:11,000 --> 02:22:11,000
Oh, really?

2122
02:22:12,000 --> 02:22:13,000
Yeah, it's something about it's fun.

2123
02:22:23,000 --> 02:22:25,000
Oh, the big opens, this is a pretty big area.

2124
02:22:27,000 --> 02:22:28,000
Lots of room for activities.

2125
02:22:31,000 --> 02:22:32,000
Yeah, we're gonna get some warm tear.

2126
02:22:35,000 --> 02:22:37,000
All right, is there a gattling gunner?

2127
02:22:37,000 --> 02:22:38,000
Grown here?

2128
02:22:38,000 --> 02:22:40,000
Because it just gave me a tool tip.

2129
02:22:40,000 --> 02:22:41,000
Really?

2130
02:22:41,000 --> 02:22:43,000
Hey, watch out for the gattling gunner.

2131
02:22:44,000 --> 02:22:46,000
Just to let you know in case you find one sometime.

2132
02:22:47,000 --> 02:22:50,000
It just gave me a random tip about the gunner.

2133
02:22:50,000 --> 02:22:51,000
Oh, that was fun.

2134
02:22:53,000 --> 02:22:54,000
But just like head exploding.

2135
02:22:54,000 --> 02:22:57,000
No, I just sidearmed that guy and it's a friggin temple.

2136
02:23:10,000 --> 02:23:27,000
I can definitely tell it's different between hard mode and normal mode.

2137
02:23:27,000 --> 02:23:27,000
Let me say that.

2138
02:23:27,000 --> 02:23:31,000
Yeah, like I was saying earlier, can you imagine doing this on like anything besides what we're doing right now?

2139
02:23:32,000 --> 02:23:34,000
Like going another step up.

2140
02:23:34,000 --> 02:23:35,000
Another step up just.

2141
02:23:35,000 --> 02:23:38,000
I'm gonna play that expert on left for death.

2142
02:23:39,000 --> 02:23:44,000
And you needed the utmost coordination with everybody to be able to do it.

2143
02:23:44,000 --> 02:23:48,000
Yes, you have to like move and like a speck ops team.

2144
02:23:48,000 --> 02:23:49,000
Is a bomb on her?

2145
02:23:53,000 --> 02:23:54,000
I will come get it.

2146
02:23:54,000 --> 02:23:55,000
It's a bomb.

2147
02:23:55,000 --> 02:23:56,000
They're extremely useful.

2148
02:24:04,000 --> 02:24:05,000
Toast to the emperor.

2149
02:24:06,000 --> 02:24:07,000
Who?

2150
02:24:07,000 --> 02:24:08,000
Who indeed is the emperor?

2151
02:24:08,000 --> 02:24:10,000
Uh, or hammer guy.

2152
02:24:10,000 --> 02:24:12,000
He's a war hammer guy.

2153
02:24:12,000 --> 02:24:12,000
That's all I know.

2154
02:24:15,000 --> 02:24:17,000
Oh, pack guy, pack guy, pack guy.

2155
02:24:22,000 --> 02:24:23,000
No, I'm just throwing a grenade at him.

2156
02:24:23,000 --> 02:24:25,000
Fuck this guy.

2157
02:24:26,000 --> 02:24:26,000
Where?

2158
02:24:28,000 --> 02:24:29,000
Like down there.

2159
02:24:31,000 --> 02:24:31,000
Give me the load.

2160
02:24:31,000 --> 02:24:32,000
I want the dice.

2161
02:24:32,000 --> 02:24:33,000
Please.

2162
02:24:34,000 --> 02:24:37,000
I guess I wasn't supposed to jump from where I just jumped.

2163
02:24:39,000 --> 02:24:40,000
We got two more dice.

2164
02:24:41,000 --> 02:24:41,000
Two more die.

2165
02:24:43,000 --> 02:24:44,000
So we've got two dice already?

2166
02:24:45,000 --> 02:24:45,000
Yeah.

2167
02:24:50,000 --> 02:24:50,000
Hello, Tim.

2168
02:24:52,000 --> 02:24:54,000
Um, he's kind of far away.

2169
02:24:54,000 --> 02:24:54,000
Boy, he's in.

2170
02:24:55,000 --> 02:24:57,000
He is umm indeed, shit now too.

2171
02:24:59,000 --> 02:25:00,000
Yeah, me too.

2172
02:25:02,000 --> 02:25:04,000
Two more for the fuck.

2173
02:25:13,000 --> 02:25:14,000
Whew.

2174
02:25:15,000 --> 02:25:16,000
This might be eight.

2175
02:25:16,000 --> 02:25:16,000
You love it.

2176
02:25:16,000 --> 02:25:17,000
They have it.

2177
02:25:17,000 --> 02:25:19,000
Second floor gate.

2178
02:25:19,000 --> 02:25:20,000
Second floor gate.

2179
02:25:20,000 --> 02:25:21,000
Yeah, this is going to be hard.

2180
02:25:22,000 --> 02:25:23,000
But you know what?

2181
02:25:23,000 --> 02:25:25,000
You could always just be crawling around on your knees

2182
02:25:25,000 --> 02:25:26,000
and sliding around.

2183
02:25:27,000 --> 02:25:27,000
You know, you couldn't do that.

2184
02:25:27,000 --> 02:25:30,000
You could just like make sure you're looking for your contact

2185
02:25:30,000 --> 02:25:30,000
and find it.

2186
02:25:31,000 --> 02:25:33,000
Yeah, let's just let's just come and create

2187
02:25:33,000 --> 02:25:34,000
corner crepes.

2188
02:25:34,000 --> 02:25:36,000
We have to come in a creep here.

2189
02:25:36,000 --> 02:25:37,000
Otherwise we're screwed.

2190
02:25:38,000 --> 02:25:39,000
They're going to be dropping from here.

2191
02:25:41,000 --> 02:25:42,000
I'm dead in one hit by the way.

2192
02:25:43,000 --> 02:25:44,000
Uh, yeah, I'm dead in about two.

2193
02:25:48,000 --> 02:25:49,000
Oh, geez.

2194
02:25:54,000 --> 02:25:55,000
I'm dead.

2195
02:25:58,000 --> 02:25:59,000
Get in the live.

2196
02:25:59,000 --> 02:26:01,000
It's just this one guy.

2197
02:26:02,000 --> 02:26:03,000
You got me.

2198
02:26:03,000 --> 02:26:03,000
You got me.

2199
02:26:03,000 --> 02:26:04,000
Holy shit.

2200
02:26:04,000 --> 02:26:04,000
You got me.

2201
02:26:06,000 --> 02:26:08,000
Now three of us are down over here.

2202
02:26:08,000 --> 02:26:09,000
Oh, you got it.

2203
02:26:09,000 --> 02:26:10,000
You got it.

2204
02:26:10,000 --> 02:26:10,000
Okay.

2205
02:26:10,000 --> 02:26:11,000
One two more.

2206
02:26:11,000 --> 02:26:12,000
It's blocked.

2207
02:26:12,000 --> 02:26:12,000
Block.

2208
02:26:13,000 --> 02:26:13,000
All right.

2209
02:26:13,000 --> 02:26:13,000
One more.

2210
02:26:16,000 --> 02:26:17,000
Pretty good.

2211
02:26:17,000 --> 02:26:19,000
It's got, it's got deep tapetated.

2212
02:26:21,000 --> 02:26:23,000
That guy just did a full swing and hit me.

2213
02:26:25,000 --> 02:26:26,000
Holy shit.

2214
02:26:30,000 --> 02:26:31,000
Try and hit him in the head.

2215
02:26:31,000 --> 02:26:32,000
He's moving around too much.

2216
02:26:36,000 --> 02:26:37,000
We live another day.

2217
02:26:39,000 --> 02:26:41,000
And we're all bleeding out of the sink.

2218
02:26:41,000 --> 02:26:41,000
Yeah, we are.

2219
02:26:43,000 --> 02:26:43,000
So good luck.

2220
02:26:46,000 --> 02:26:49,000
One one hit from one rat is about to put me back down.

2221
02:26:51,000 --> 02:26:51,000
Yeah.

2222
02:26:54,000 --> 02:26:56,000
Like I'm about to bleed out, just follow on these guys around.

2223
02:26:57,000 --> 02:26:58,000
Just run.

2224
02:26:58,000 --> 02:26:58,000
Run.

2225
02:26:59,000 --> 02:27:01,000
Like guys, like guys really far ahead.

2226
02:27:04,000 --> 02:27:05,000
Anything, anything post.

2227
02:27:05,000 --> 02:27:07,000
Oh, I just got the way for myself.

2228
02:27:09,000 --> 02:27:10,000
I just got the rest.

2229
02:27:10,000 --> 02:27:15,000
I just like, I used my, my spell and it took me above the threshold.

2230
02:27:15,000 --> 02:27:16,000
Look at how many of this too many.

2231
02:27:16,000 --> 02:27:17,000
There's too many.

2232
02:27:17,000 --> 02:27:18,000
We're never going to win.

2233
02:27:27,000 --> 02:27:27,000
Just keep moving.

2234
02:27:29,000 --> 02:27:33,000
Just sit dead in.

2235
02:27:33,000 --> 02:27:34,000
No.

2236
02:27:39,000 --> 02:27:40,000
I'm about to bleed out.

2237
02:27:40,000 --> 02:27:41,000
Yeah, I got you.

2238
02:27:41,000 --> 02:27:41,000
I'm about to bleed out.

2239
02:27:42,000 --> 02:27:43,000
I'm bleeding.

2240
02:27:46,000 --> 02:27:48,000
I'm not going to make it very much longer.

2241
02:27:49,000 --> 02:27:49,000
Oh, this wasn't that.

2242
02:27:51,000 --> 02:27:52,000
Just getting some turn around.

2243
02:27:52,000 --> 02:27:53,000
I think we have to actually go in here.

2244
02:27:54,000 --> 02:27:58,000
Yeah, I think we have to go into this pit where they're all spuing from.

2245
02:27:59,000 --> 02:28:00,000
Probably.

2246
02:28:06,000 --> 02:28:07,000
Oh, dead apparently.

2247
02:28:09,000 --> 02:28:10,000
Oh, like no, no, I am done done.

2248
02:28:10,000 --> 02:28:12,000
Like dead dead dead dead.

2249
02:28:12,000 --> 02:28:13,000
You're going to have to go find me.

2250
02:28:14,000 --> 02:28:16,000
I think it's anything with left for dead if you go down like three times

2251
02:28:16,000 --> 02:28:17,000
in a certain amount of period.

2252
02:28:17,000 --> 02:28:19,000
Yeah, that makes sense.

2253
02:28:22,000 --> 02:28:23,000
Well, good luck.

2254
02:28:26,000 --> 02:28:27,000
Yeah, about that.

2255
02:28:29,000 --> 02:28:34,000
There's a gambling gun guy just chilling in here, but we're hitting him with my legs.

2256
02:28:34,000 --> 02:28:35,000
They were two.

2257
02:28:35,000 --> 02:28:36,000
They were two gambling gunner guys in there.

2258
02:28:36,000 --> 02:28:40,000
Yeah, look at well, give all credit to the teammates because oh, geez.

2259
02:28:40,000 --> 02:28:41,000
I have nothing.

2260
02:28:41,000 --> 02:28:42,000
Is there any any potions there anything?

2261
02:28:45,000 --> 02:28:46,000
No food in there.

2262
02:28:47,000 --> 02:28:48,000
I'll get up that ladder.

2263
02:28:49,000 --> 02:28:49,000
Whoo.

2264
02:28:51,000 --> 02:28:52,000
Oh, come on.

2265
02:28:52,000 --> 02:28:53,000
Oh, do you see where I am?

2266
02:28:53,000 --> 02:28:53,000
I'm in here.

2267
02:28:55,000 --> 02:28:56,000
The line down.

2268
02:28:57,000 --> 02:28:58,000
Oh, wait, we won.

2269
02:28:58,000 --> 02:28:59,000
That's it.

2270
02:28:59,000 --> 02:28:59,000
We did it.

2271
02:28:59,000 --> 02:29:00,000
Should we just get in?

2272
02:29:00,000 --> 02:29:01,000
Yeah, I just get in.

2273
02:29:01,000 --> 02:29:02,000
Forget about me.

2274
02:29:02,000 --> 02:29:02,000
Okay.

2275
02:29:02,000 --> 02:29:03,000
I died for a good time.

2276
02:29:03,000 --> 02:29:04,000
I'm sorry, germa.

2277
02:29:05,000 --> 02:29:07,000
We didn't want to leave you, but we had to.

2278
02:29:09,000 --> 02:29:09,000
It's okay.

2279
02:29:09,000 --> 02:29:10,000
You can loot right?

2280
02:29:10,000 --> 02:29:10,000
Oh, yeah.

2281
02:29:12,000 --> 02:29:12,000
That's good.

2282
02:29:14,000 --> 02:29:15,000
We get less experience.

2283
02:29:15,000 --> 02:29:16,000
You don't lose anything.

2284
02:29:16,000 --> 02:29:17,000
You got two extra die.

2285
02:29:21,000 --> 02:29:24,000
You get bonus points for going with everyone, I guess?

2286
02:29:24,000 --> 02:29:24,000
Yeah.

2287
02:29:25,000 --> 02:29:25,000
You get more experience.

2288
02:29:28,000 --> 02:29:31,000
All right, time to roll.

2289
02:29:31,000 --> 02:29:32,000
Two, three, four, five.

2290
02:29:32,000 --> 02:29:34,000
There's a legendary at the top.

2291
02:29:36,000 --> 02:29:37,000
No.

2292
02:29:39,000 --> 02:29:40,000
What's your gun?

2293
02:29:40,000 --> 02:29:42,000
I need to roll it.

2294
02:29:42,000 --> 02:29:42,000
Two.

2295
02:29:42,000 --> 02:29:44,000
I need to roll it.

2296
02:29:49,000 --> 02:29:49,000
It's a man.

2297
02:29:49,000 --> 02:29:51,000
Actually, the first time I've seen a mace.

2298
02:29:53,000 --> 02:29:55,000
It's for the empire.

2299
02:29:55,000 --> 02:29:56,000
I get.

2300
02:29:56,000 --> 02:29:58,000
I got a green axe for the dwarf.

2301
02:30:08,000 --> 02:30:10,000
This guy was fucking carrying hard.

2302
02:30:10,000 --> 02:30:13,000
Yeah, he was about to say the exact same thing.

2303
02:30:13,000 --> 02:30:14,000
I got a hard carry.

2304
02:30:17,000 --> 02:30:18,000
He isn't the best.

2305
02:30:18,000 --> 02:30:19,000
Good work, dude.

2306
02:30:19,000 --> 02:30:20,000
Good work, guy that won us the game.

2307
02:30:21,000 --> 02:30:22,000
He's very humble too.

2308
02:30:24,000 --> 02:30:25,000
I want to look at that mace.

2309
02:30:26,000 --> 02:30:28,000
I got a red axe for the empire soldier.

2310
02:30:28,000 --> 02:30:30,000
I don't think I can.

2311
02:30:34,000 --> 02:30:35,000
I'm on a bow.

2312
02:30:35,000 --> 02:30:36,000
Come on down.

2313
02:30:36,000 --> 02:30:37,000
We're off.

2314
02:30:37,000 --> 02:30:38,000
I'll cut you.

2315
02:30:38,000 --> 02:30:39,000
Won't do this.

2316
02:30:39,000 --> 02:30:40,000
It's like around how many missions do you need to do

2317
02:30:40,000 --> 02:30:43,000
before you start crafting stuff?

2318
02:30:43,000 --> 02:30:44,000
Once you get a handful of greens,

2319
02:30:44,000 --> 02:30:46,000
you can start to break them down and make them

2320
02:30:46,000 --> 02:30:47,000
and make them.

2321
02:30:47,000 --> 02:30:49,000
I'm going to do this.

2322
02:30:49,000 --> 02:30:50,000
I'm going to do this.

2323
02:30:50,000 --> 02:30:51,000
I'm going to do this.

2324
02:30:51,000 --> 02:30:52,000
I'm going to do this.

2325
02:30:52,000 --> 02:30:54,000
I'm going to do this.

2326
02:30:54,000 --> 02:30:54,000
I'm going to do this.

2327
02:30:54,000 --> 02:30:56,000
You can start to break them down and make things.

2328
02:30:59,000 --> 02:31:02,000
I mean, the one hander is cool, but

2329
02:31:03,000 --> 02:31:04,000
I got the...

2330
02:31:04,000 --> 02:31:07,000
Do you have the crossbow for the witch hunter?

2331
02:31:09,000 --> 02:31:10,000
I'm assuming, yes.

2332
02:31:10,000 --> 02:31:13,000
No, I mean, I've been crafting down 90% of the things I get

2333
02:31:13,000 --> 02:31:14,000
to try to make something for a character I like to play.

2334
02:31:15,000 --> 02:31:15,000
Oh, really?

2335
02:31:16,000 --> 02:31:18,000
Well, I mean, don't you like the witch hunter?

2336
02:31:19,000 --> 02:31:21,000
I do like the witch hunter, but I also like empire.

2337
02:31:21,000 --> 02:31:25,000
So I like witch hunter, dwarf, and empire soldier.

2338
02:31:27,000 --> 02:31:30,000
Way watchers fun, but I don't know.

2339
02:31:32,000 --> 02:31:35,000
I like playing big two-hander or big, you know, fast super dude.

2340
02:31:38,000 --> 02:31:41,000
But I suggest buying the complete edition instead of the normal one.

2341
02:31:41,000 --> 02:31:42,000
What's in the complete edition?

2342
02:31:44,000 --> 02:31:46,000
Are you sure that's not like a soundtrack?

2343
02:31:48,000 --> 02:31:50,000
I'm like being completely honest like I think that would be...

2344
02:31:50,000 --> 02:31:52,000
You get a digital art book.

2345
02:31:53,000 --> 02:31:56,000
I don't know if I just bought the normal version I thought.

2346
02:32:02,000 --> 02:32:04,000
I like these because...

2347
02:32:06,000 --> 02:32:07,000
Now, how does that make any sense, right?

2348
02:32:07,000 --> 02:32:09,000
So this is a big two-handed mace,

2349
02:32:11,000 --> 02:32:13,000
and it hits way less targets with...

2350
02:32:13,000 --> 02:32:16,000
This hits so many people with a little one-hander, really.

2351
02:32:17,000 --> 02:32:19,000
I guess they kind of reverse, right?

2352
02:32:19,000 --> 02:32:22,000
So the big two-hander, the charge attack hits a million people,

2353
02:32:22,000 --> 02:32:25,000
but it's normal attack hits like one person.

2354
02:32:25,000 --> 02:32:29,000
But the one-hander hits way more people on a standard attack,

2355
02:32:29,000 --> 02:32:31,000
but doesn't hit barely anybody with a charge attack,

2356
02:32:31,000 --> 02:32:32,000
but it does more damage.

2357
02:32:34,000 --> 02:32:35,000
And I'll give it a try.

2358
02:32:35,000 --> 02:32:36,000
I'm gonna try it.

2359
02:32:40,000 --> 02:32:41,000
Ah!

2360
02:32:41,000 --> 02:32:42,000
Keep moving, Dory!

2361
02:32:42,000 --> 02:32:44,000
We already have an empire.

2362
02:32:45,000 --> 02:32:46,000
Ah, we already have an empire.

2363
02:32:46,000 --> 02:32:47,000
Soldier.

2364
02:32:54,000 --> 02:32:56,000
I think I'm gonna try two-handed dwarf.

2365
02:33:06,000 --> 02:33:07,000
I'll keep that for now.

2366
02:33:09,000 --> 02:33:10,000
I'm scared to crack that thing.

2367
02:33:10,000 --> 02:33:11,000
Yeah, the charge attack most of the time.

2368
02:33:11,000 --> 02:33:12,000
That's what I was doing when I was playing with it,

2369
02:33:12,000 --> 02:33:14,000
mostly just sweeping side to side.

2370
02:33:20,000 --> 02:33:22,000
Yeah, you kind of do just bop people with a big two-hander.

2371
02:33:26,000 --> 02:33:28,000
Oh, again, I can change to the empire soldier.

2372
02:33:32,000 --> 02:33:33,000
So here's the new mace.

2373
02:33:39,000 --> 02:33:40,000
It's got an odd animation set.

2374
02:33:41,000 --> 02:33:43,000
Looks like it's left, right.

2375
02:33:44,000 --> 02:33:45,000
Up, down, no, down, up.

2376
02:33:46,000 --> 02:33:48,000
Is the charge, charges just straight up and down.

2377
02:33:52,000 --> 02:33:53,000
All right, other one more.

2378
02:33:53,000 --> 02:33:54,000
Let's do one more.

2379
02:33:55,000 --> 02:33:56,000
Oki-doki.

2380
02:33:56,000 --> 02:33:57,000
It's too much more.

2381
02:33:58,000 --> 02:33:59,000
I have unlocked new missions.

2382
02:34:00,000 --> 02:34:02,000
Let's do one of the ones you've unlocked.

2383
02:34:02,000 --> 02:34:03,000
We can do...

2384
02:34:04,000 --> 02:34:05,000
Garden of more.

2385
02:34:06,000 --> 02:34:07,000
Man the ramparts.

2386
02:34:08,000 --> 02:34:09,000
Engines of war.

2387
02:34:09,000 --> 02:34:10,000
Or wheat and chat.

2388
02:34:11,000 --> 02:34:15,000
Wheat, uh, that's one where you grab bags and bring them.

2389
02:34:15,000 --> 02:34:16,000
It's a short one.

2390
02:34:16,000 --> 02:34:16,000
Do that one.

2391
02:34:16,000 --> 02:34:17,000
We'll do that one.

2392
02:34:17,000 --> 02:34:18,000
It's that one's short.

2393
02:34:25,000 --> 02:34:26,000
That's one of the only S3.

2394
02:34:28,000 --> 02:34:29,000
Oh, god, are you sure?

2395
02:34:29,000 --> 02:34:30,000
Are you sure?

2396
02:34:31,000 --> 02:34:32,000
Oh, yeah.

2397
02:34:32,000 --> 02:34:33,000
Baby.

2398
02:34:33,000 --> 02:34:35,000
Let's get our asses kicked for the little...

2399
02:34:35,000 --> 02:34:37,000
Let's get our asses kicked to end the stream.

2400
02:34:37,000 --> 02:34:38,000
That sounds like fun.

2401
02:34:40,000 --> 02:34:41,000
Stick together, please.

2402
02:34:41,000 --> 02:34:43,000
I do what I can.

2403
02:34:43,000 --> 02:34:44,000
Mom.

2404
02:34:44,000 --> 02:34:46,000
Die, will you?

2405
02:34:46,000 --> 02:34:48,000
I like that's one of my favorite lines.

2406
02:34:48,000 --> 02:34:50,000
Die, will you?

2407
02:34:50,000 --> 02:34:51,000
Free to you.

2408
02:34:51,000 --> 02:34:52,000
Die.

2409
02:34:52,000 --> 02:34:53,000
Die.

2410
02:34:53,000 --> 02:34:54,000
Free to you.

2411
02:34:54,000 --> 02:34:55,000
Die.

2412
02:34:55,000 --> 02:34:56,000
Die.

2413
02:34:56,000 --> 02:34:58,000
Die.

2414
02:34:58,000 --> 02:35:00,000
Die.

2415
02:35:00,000 --> 02:35:02,000
Die.

2416
02:35:02,000 --> 02:35:04,000
Die, will you?

2417
02:35:04,000 --> 02:35:06,000
All right.

2418
02:35:06,000 --> 02:35:08,000
Let's make it a good one.

2419
02:35:08,000 --> 02:35:14,000
The sky then seemed to have overlooked some of the farms.

2420
02:35:14,000 --> 02:35:16,000
But it won't last for long.

2421
02:35:16,000 --> 02:35:18,000
The end time.

2422
02:35:18,000 --> 02:35:20,000
Fill out the wagon with food.

2423
02:35:20,000 --> 02:35:22,000
The Uber Shroyk resisted.

2424
02:35:22,000 --> 02:35:24,000
So what are the odds of them making another game in this vein?

2425
02:35:24,000 --> 02:35:26,000
I'm sure they have for like 40k.

2426
02:35:26,000 --> 02:35:30,000
Probably very close to zero.

2427
02:35:30,000 --> 02:35:34,000
But what are the future plans?

2428
02:35:34,000 --> 02:35:36,000
Was this game successful?

2429
02:35:36,000 --> 02:35:38,000
I mean, isn't this by the same sales?

2430
02:35:38,000 --> 02:35:40,000
Is this by the...

2431
02:35:40,000 --> 02:35:42,000
The war of the Vikings, guys, didn't they make this game?

2432
02:35:42,000 --> 02:35:46,000
I feel like they just do different games every time they make a game.

2433
02:35:46,000 --> 02:35:50,000
I feel like people like hire them out to do games.

2434
02:35:50,000 --> 02:35:52,000
Yeah.

2435
02:35:52,000 --> 02:35:54,000
They're just for hire.

2436
02:35:54,000 --> 02:35:56,000
Did they do mountain blade?

2437
02:35:56,000 --> 02:35:58,000
I know they did some...

2438
02:35:58,000 --> 02:36:00,000
ARPGs.

2439
02:36:00,000 --> 02:36:02,000
Like one or two ARPGs.

2440
02:36:02,000 --> 02:36:04,000
They've done...

2441
02:36:04,000 --> 02:36:06,000
I already knew the creator was one of them.

2442
02:36:06,000 --> 02:36:08,000
I know they did.

2443
02:36:08,000 --> 02:36:10,000
Were the Vikings.

2444
02:36:10,000 --> 02:36:12,000
Were they published for the Vikings?

2445
02:36:12,000 --> 02:36:14,000
Was that paradox?

2446
02:36:14,000 --> 02:36:16,000
I don't even know.

2447
02:36:16,000 --> 02:36:18,000
It's politics.

2448
02:36:18,000 --> 02:36:20,000
Gaming politics.

2449
02:36:20,000 --> 02:36:22,000
They don't...

2450
02:36:22,000 --> 02:36:24,000
They don't stick with one particular series.

2451
02:36:24,000 --> 02:36:26,000
I don't think they kind of just make...

2452
02:36:26,000 --> 02:36:28,000
Whatever games they feel like making.

2453
02:36:28,000 --> 02:36:30,000
Although they did it.

2454
02:36:30,000 --> 02:36:32,000
Maybe they did it.

2455
02:36:32,000 --> 02:36:34,000
War the roses?

2456
02:36:34,000 --> 02:36:38,000
Um, you know, I feel like I should know the answer to these questions.

2457
02:36:38,000 --> 02:36:40,000
I should know the answer.

2458
02:36:40,000 --> 02:36:42,000
You're a talix like the gamer knowledge guy.

2459
02:36:42,000 --> 02:36:44,000
I'm like the NDE person.

2460
02:36:44,000 --> 02:36:46,000
I should know answers.

2461
02:36:46,000 --> 02:36:48,000
Can we couple horse?

2462
02:36:48,000 --> 02:36:50,000
I think so.

2463
02:36:50,000 --> 02:36:52,000
Paradox published mountain blade.

2464
02:36:54,000 --> 02:36:58,000
Yeah, but mountain blade and war the roses are not...

2465
02:36:58,000 --> 02:37:00,000
Same thing.

2466
02:37:00,000 --> 02:37:04,000
No, not... maybe I'm confusing it too.

2467
02:37:04,000 --> 02:37:06,000
Mountain blade was published but not...

2468
02:37:06,000 --> 02:37:08,000
It was like...

2469
02:37:08,000 --> 02:37:10,000
It's a different thing.

2470
02:37:10,000 --> 02:37:12,000
Like the new mountain blade is not Paradox.

2471
02:37:12,000 --> 02:37:14,000
Okay.

2472
02:37:14,000 --> 02:37:16,000
But...

2473
02:37:16,000 --> 02:37:18,000
I don't know.

2474
02:37:18,000 --> 02:37:20,000
It doesn't matter.

2475
02:37:20,000 --> 02:37:22,000
I think we're going all the way.

2476
02:37:22,000 --> 02:37:24,000
It looks like we are.

2477
02:37:24,000 --> 02:37:26,000
I mean, I think since it's start with the far ones early on.

2478
02:37:26,000 --> 02:37:28,000
That would make sense.

2479
02:37:28,000 --> 02:37:30,000
Move back.

2480
02:37:30,000 --> 02:37:32,000
There's a lot of guys in here though.

2481
02:37:32,000 --> 02:37:36,000
That would make sense.

2482
02:37:46,000 --> 02:37:50,000
So can the sex also burn?

2483
02:37:50,000 --> 02:37:52,000
I don't like it.

2484
02:37:52,000 --> 02:37:54,000
If they get damaged.

2485
02:37:54,000 --> 02:37:56,000
I'm terrified to eat.

2486
02:37:56,000 --> 02:37:58,000
Oh boy, you are in deep shit by yourself down there.

2487
02:37:58,000 --> 02:38:00,000
Not me.

2488
02:38:00,000 --> 02:38:02,000
Oh, that's right.

2489
02:38:02,000 --> 02:38:04,000
You're not playing that character.

2490
02:38:04,000 --> 02:38:06,000
I am the dwarf.

2491
02:38:06,000 --> 02:38:14,000
Oh, why am I taking damage?

2492
02:38:14,000 --> 02:38:16,000
Oh, I must be able to swing.

2493
02:38:16,000 --> 02:38:18,000
Big swing and hit everybody.

2494
02:38:18,000 --> 02:38:22,000
Oh, dear.

2495
02:38:22,000 --> 02:38:26,000
I can't even see where is he.

2496
02:38:26,000 --> 02:38:30,000
I got the poison.

2497
02:38:30,000 --> 02:38:34,000
He's effectively blocking my vision.

2498
02:38:34,000 --> 02:38:36,000
You killed my ass.

2499
02:38:36,000 --> 02:38:42,000
I'm just not a bitch.

2500
02:38:42,000 --> 02:38:46,000
You son of a bitch.

2501
02:38:46,000 --> 02:38:48,000
Stay with me.

2502
02:38:48,000 --> 02:38:50,000
Do we have all the sacks?

2503
02:38:50,000 --> 02:38:52,000
Is there one more?

2504
02:38:52,000 --> 02:38:54,000
We got him.

2505
02:38:54,000 --> 02:38:56,000
Oh crap.

2506
02:38:56,000 --> 02:38:58,000
I'm stuck.

2507
02:38:58,000 --> 02:39:00,000
Hang on.

2508
02:39:00,000 --> 02:39:02,000
What do you mean you stuck?

2509
02:39:02,000 --> 02:39:04,000
What do you mean you stuck?

2510
02:39:04,000 --> 02:39:06,000
Oh, God.

2511
02:39:06,000 --> 02:39:08,000
What's happening to you?

2512
02:39:08,000 --> 02:39:10,000
Getting wrecked.

2513
02:39:10,000 --> 02:39:16,000
I'm going to run around seven to ten rats to drop in front of the door frame that I was in.

2514
02:39:16,000 --> 02:39:18,000
I'm the tank.

2515
02:39:18,000 --> 02:39:20,000
And the tank's right next to me.

2516
02:39:20,000 --> 02:39:22,000
Are you serious?

2517
02:39:22,000 --> 02:39:24,000
Yeah.

2518
02:39:24,000 --> 02:39:26,000
He's just hitting me.

2519
02:39:26,000 --> 02:39:30,000
But I'm trying to get close as I can to you guys.

2520
02:39:30,000 --> 02:39:34,000
I'm going to run around seven to ten rats.

2521
02:39:34,000 --> 02:39:38,000
I'm going to run around seven to ten rats.

2522
02:39:38,000 --> 02:39:42,000
We got two playing as the soldier or the witch.

2523
02:39:42,000 --> 02:39:46,000
Empire soldier.

2524
02:39:46,000 --> 02:39:50,000
Because I am saying it's both you as possible for when I bleed out again.

2525
02:39:50,000 --> 02:39:52,000
He's dead.

2526
02:39:52,000 --> 02:39:54,000
Hey, we're fine.

2527
02:39:54,000 --> 02:39:56,000
Come here.

2528
02:39:56,000 --> 02:39:58,000
Where are you?

2529
02:39:58,000 --> 02:40:00,000
I was glazing over the screen.

2530
02:40:00,000 --> 02:40:02,000
Not fine.

2531
02:40:02,000 --> 02:40:04,000
That wasn't a short joke.

2532
02:40:04,000 --> 02:40:06,000
That was a short fact.

2533
02:40:06,000 --> 02:40:08,000
What's that?

2534
02:40:08,000 --> 02:40:10,000
So where are the sects?

2535
02:40:10,000 --> 02:40:12,000
Have we already deposited the other ones?

2536
02:40:12,000 --> 02:40:14,000
We'd be able to deposit it too.

2537
02:40:14,000 --> 02:40:16,000
Oh.

2538
02:40:16,000 --> 02:40:18,000
Okay then.

2539
02:40:18,000 --> 02:40:20,000
Did I know?

2540
02:40:20,000 --> 02:40:22,000
I don't like this weapon.

2541
02:40:22,000 --> 02:40:24,000
I don't like it.

2542
02:40:24,000 --> 02:40:26,000
You decided that you don't like it.

2543
02:40:26,000 --> 02:40:28,000
What is it again?

2544
02:40:28,000 --> 02:40:30,000
It's a one handed base that barely.

2545
02:40:30,000 --> 02:40:32,000
I don't like the breach.

2546
02:40:32,000 --> 02:40:34,000
Isn't German shortened real life?

2547
02:40:34,000 --> 02:40:38,000
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, whoa, whoa, whoa, easy.

2548
02:40:38,000 --> 02:40:40,000
Five, seven, five, eight.

2549
02:40:40,000 --> 02:40:42,000
This is a very average average.

2550
02:40:42,000 --> 02:40:46,000
I've heard average person.

2551
02:40:46,000 --> 02:40:50,000
I just saved us.

2552
02:40:50,000 --> 02:40:52,000
I will take credit for that.

2553
02:40:52,000 --> 02:40:54,000
I will take credit for the saving of humanity.

2554
02:40:54,000 --> 02:40:56,000
Two sex.

2555
02:40:56,000 --> 02:41:00,000
I'm definitely still like I'm playing above my my grade.

2556
02:41:00,000 --> 02:41:02,000
You're doing fine.

2557
02:41:02,000 --> 02:41:04,000
We're doing fine.

2558
02:41:04,000 --> 02:41:06,000
We only have two more to get after this and they're right next to the cart.

2559
02:41:06,000 --> 02:41:10,000
Long as we don't get screwed over by a don don't jinx.

2560
02:41:10,000 --> 02:41:12,000
I'm just like I have.

2561
02:41:12,000 --> 02:41:14,000
I'm just like I have.

2562
02:41:14,000 --> 02:41:16,000
I'm just like I have.

2563
02:41:16,000 --> 02:41:18,000
I'm just like I have.

2564
02:41:18,000 --> 02:41:20,000
I'm just like I have.

2565
02:41:20,000 --> 02:41:22,000
I'm just like I have.

2566
02:41:22,000 --> 02:41:24,000
I'm just like I have.

2567
02:41:24,000 --> 02:41:26,000
At apple pie.

2568
02:41:26,000 --> 02:41:30,000
Long as an apple pie doesn't fly down and shoot us or something.

2569
02:41:30,000 --> 02:41:32,000
We find.

2570
02:41:32,000 --> 02:41:36,000
Get it here. Let's close the door.

2571
02:41:36,000 --> 02:41:38,000
Come on up.

2572
02:41:38,000 --> 02:41:40,000
Are you going to come get this one?

2573
02:41:40,000 --> 02:41:42,000
Yeah.

2574
02:41:42,000 --> 02:41:46,000
We just tossed him down.

2575
02:41:46,000 --> 02:41:50,000
Just got to keep him up.

2576
02:41:50,000 --> 02:41:52,000
I'm going to put it down.

2577
02:41:52,000 --> 02:41:54,000
I'm getting smirked here.

2578
02:41:54,000 --> 02:41:58,000
Oh, I got pulled.

2579
02:41:58,000 --> 02:42:00,000
You're okay.

2580
02:42:00,000 --> 02:42:02,000
You're okay.

2581
02:42:02,000 --> 02:42:04,000
We're good.

2582
02:42:04,000 --> 02:42:08,000
All the sacks are right here.

2583
02:42:08,000 --> 02:42:12,000
So much happening right now.

2584
02:42:12,000 --> 02:42:14,000
Really.

2585
02:42:14,000 --> 02:42:16,000
Really another one.

2586
02:42:16,000 --> 02:42:18,000
What the hell?

2587
02:42:18,000 --> 02:42:20,000
That is like three and a really.

2588
02:42:20,000 --> 02:42:22,000
We all this is it.

2589
02:42:22,000 --> 02:42:24,000
We can get these.

2590
02:42:24,000 --> 02:42:26,000
Then we can just get in with the truck.

2591
02:42:26,000 --> 02:42:28,000
We're so close to the coach.

2592
02:42:28,000 --> 02:42:30,000
Just don't get pulled by anything.

2593
02:42:30,000 --> 02:42:32,000
Look at our clothes.

2594
02:42:32,000 --> 02:42:34,000
There's no pull rats.

2595
02:42:34,000 --> 02:42:38,000
No bullshit.

2596
02:42:38,000 --> 02:42:40,000
We'll be fine.

2597
02:42:40,000 --> 02:42:44,000
Just do the just be like a wide receiver and dodge around.

2598
02:42:44,000 --> 02:42:46,000
Mule residents.

2599
02:42:46,000 --> 02:42:47,000
We're here.

2600
02:42:47,000 --> 02:42:49,000
And there it is.

2601
02:42:49,000 --> 02:42:51,000
Look at that.

2602
02:42:51,000 --> 02:42:53,000
Four.

2603
02:42:53,000 --> 02:42:55,000
Five.

2604
02:42:55,000 --> 02:42:57,000
And six.

2605
02:42:57,000 --> 02:42:59,000
Get in.

2606
02:42:59,000 --> 02:43:01,000
Let's close it up.

2607
02:43:01,000 --> 02:43:03,000
Let me just stay.

2608
02:43:03,000 --> 02:43:05,000
Let me just blow that guy's brains out again.

2609
02:43:05,000 --> 02:43:07,000
Yes, you're so bad.

2610
02:43:07,000 --> 02:43:09,000
Well, they're really good teamwork.

2611
02:43:09,000 --> 02:43:13,000
They got kind of hairy there for a second.

2612
02:43:13,000 --> 02:43:15,000
There was such good teamwork.

2613
02:43:15,000 --> 02:43:19,000
Everybody was sticking together except for me when I went down and had to get rescued.

2614
02:43:19,000 --> 02:43:23,000
This is when we're going to get the legendary legendary acts.

2615
02:43:23,000 --> 02:43:25,000
They're going to be all spaced up.

2616
02:43:25,000 --> 02:43:33,000
How tough is it to get like the extras on this map like the dice and the tones?

2617
02:43:33,000 --> 02:43:35,000
I'm not joking.

2618
02:43:35,000 --> 02:43:37,000
I just got all face down.

2619
02:43:37,000 --> 02:43:39,000
Is he really?

2620
02:43:39,000 --> 02:43:41,000
I only got one.

2621
02:43:41,000 --> 02:43:43,000
So bowl head.

2622
02:43:43,000 --> 02:43:51,000
Well, it equipped your health is increased by 30% while knocked down.

2623
02:43:51,000 --> 02:43:53,000
That's that's pretty good.

2624
02:43:53,000 --> 02:43:57,000
So that means that you'll just stay alive longer when you're knocked down.

2625
02:43:57,000 --> 02:44:01,000
Yeah.

2626
02:44:01,000 --> 02:44:05,000
I just said, yeah, I have an idea.

2627
02:44:05,000 --> 02:44:11,000
Let's go.

2628
02:44:11,000 --> 02:44:15,000
All right. Well, I think, um, time is it.

2629
02:44:15,000 --> 02:44:17,000
It's probably getting late.

2630
02:44:17,000 --> 02:44:19,000
It's like 2 a.m.

2631
02:44:19,000 --> 02:44:21,000
Oh, it's almost happy new years in mountain time.

2632
02:44:21,000 --> 02:44:27,000
Hey, you know what? We'll stay up for mountain time for a for a mountain time happy.

2633
02:44:27,000 --> 02:44:31,000
Mountain time.

2634
02:44:31,000 --> 02:44:35,000
This guy's level 37. This guy plays this guy's played this game quite a bit.

2635
02:44:35,000 --> 02:44:37,000
I'm level 63.

2636
02:44:37,000 --> 02:44:39,000
This dude is level 63.

2637
02:44:39,000 --> 02:44:41,000
Damn, you're a pro man. This guy is a pro.

2638
02:44:41,000 --> 02:44:47,000
He's probably like really complaining about us when we can't hear him.

2639
02:44:47,000 --> 02:44:51,000
I wonder. I wonder if he's just like, he thinks we just suck.

2640
02:44:51,000 --> 02:44:53,000
He's like, oh my god. He's the idiot.

2641
02:44:53,000 --> 02:44:55,000
He's don't even know how to do like the real strategies.

2642
02:44:55,000 --> 02:44:57,000
Fuck these two.

2643
02:44:57,000 --> 02:44:59,000
He didn't even 360. No scope that guy.

2644
02:44:59,000 --> 02:45:01,000
Okay, I wish, can I like inspect him?

2645
02:45:01,000 --> 02:45:03,000
I want to see what he has. He probably has cool stuff.

2646
02:45:03,000 --> 02:45:05,000
That would be cool.

2647
02:45:05,000 --> 02:45:07,000
I want to see it.

2648
02:45:07,000 --> 02:45:09,000
Those onions? Are those onions?

2649
02:45:09,000 --> 02:45:11,000
Dude, he's got like garlic.

2650
02:45:11,000 --> 02:45:15,000
It's a fucking anti vampire. He's got like a bunch of cloves of garlic on him.

2651
02:45:15,000 --> 02:45:19,000
When I crouch, I feel like a baby.

2652
02:45:19,000 --> 02:45:21,000
I want to see his garlic belt. Look at that. Look at that.

2653
02:45:21,000 --> 02:45:23,000
Look at that. Garlic.

2654
02:45:23,000 --> 02:45:25,000
She's got a two. Look. She got a two.

2655
02:45:25,000 --> 02:45:27,000
Nice.

2656
02:45:27,000 --> 02:45:29,000
What about you?

2657
02:45:29,000 --> 02:45:33,000
You don't have any garlic. You suck.

2658
02:45:33,000 --> 02:45:35,000
Okay, what are we going to do?

2659
02:45:35,000 --> 02:45:37,000
What does this look like?

2660
02:45:37,000 --> 02:45:39,000
What does it look like?

2661
02:45:39,000 --> 02:45:41,000
When I crouch dodge like this.

2662
02:45:41,000 --> 02:45:43,000
You gotta just jump backwards.

2663
02:45:43,000 --> 02:45:47,000
I'm crouching though. I should be really little.

2664
02:45:47,000 --> 02:45:49,000
I don't think you have a crouch.

2665
02:45:49,000 --> 02:45:51,000
I'm crouching right now.

2666
02:45:51,000 --> 02:45:55,000
Your crouch is you kind of just peering over and looking at a situation.

2667
02:45:55,000 --> 02:45:57,000
You're just like, oh, I'm crouching right now.

2668
02:45:57,000 --> 02:45:59,000
Your crouch is you kind of just peering over and looking at a situation.

2669
02:45:59,000 --> 02:46:01,000
Now I'm crouching. Now I'm crouching.

2670
02:46:01,000 --> 02:46:05,000
Your crouch is just you hunching your face forward a tiny bit.

2671
02:46:05,000 --> 02:46:07,000
I'm like taking this tactical position.

2672
02:46:07,000 --> 02:46:11,000
I gotta make sure that like I stay as low as I can.

2673
02:46:11,000 --> 02:46:13,000
You're peering around a corner.

2674
02:46:13,000 --> 02:46:17,000
You're hiding from somebody and looking like, oh, can you see me?

2675
02:46:17,000 --> 02:46:21,000
What is this shrine of solace? I just am on it.

2676
02:46:21,000 --> 02:46:23,000
Oh, this is a case when you go to the shrine.

2677
02:46:23,000 --> 02:46:25,000
I'm going to go to the shrine.

2678
02:46:25,000 --> 02:46:27,000
I'm going to go to the shrine of solace.

2679
02:46:27,000 --> 02:46:29,000
I just am on it.

2680
02:46:29,000 --> 02:46:31,000
Oh, this is a case when you go to here.

2681
02:46:31,000 --> 02:46:37,000
When you salvage items, whatever rarity they are, you get the stones.

2682
02:46:37,000 --> 02:46:45,000
You can take those stones and you can craft a random item for whatever melee slot character you want.

2683
02:46:45,000 --> 02:46:47,000
You put the trinket in here.

2684
02:46:47,000 --> 02:46:49,000
It looks like you can choose ranged or melee.

2685
02:46:49,000 --> 02:46:53,000
Or you can save a little bit and pick a random.

2686
02:46:53,000 --> 02:46:55,000
So it'll be a ranged or melee.

2687
02:46:55,000 --> 02:46:57,000
But it's cheaper.

2688
02:46:57,000 --> 02:46:59,000
It is cheaper, but you don't know what you're going to get.

2689
02:46:59,000 --> 02:47:03,000
So if you specifically want to sword and you do the random and you get a bow or something,

2690
02:47:03,000 --> 02:47:07,000
you're going to be like, oh shit, I should have just waited.

2691
02:47:07,000 --> 02:47:09,000
That's pretty cool.

2692
02:47:09,000 --> 02:47:13,000
Yeah, I mean, guys, we're talking about, thanks for joining me.

2693
02:47:13,000 --> 02:47:21,000
Thanks for joining me in the, you know, us, me and the talc, Talc, Talc, K-Boy, and his hung out for our entire year of 2016.

2694
02:47:21,000 --> 02:47:25,000
Entire entire year of 2016, stream.

2695
02:47:25,000 --> 02:47:29,000
I haven't turned off my stream the entire year.

2696
02:47:29,000 --> 02:47:33,000
This is 365 days of streaming.

2697
02:47:33,000 --> 02:47:37,000
Full 100% have not turned off my stream all year.

2698
02:47:37,000 --> 02:47:41,000
Everyone wants to talk about how I don't stream.

2699
02:47:41,000 --> 02:47:45,000
This is the longest stream of 2016.

2700
02:47:45,000 --> 02:47:47,000
I don't know about that.

2701
02:47:47,000 --> 02:47:49,000
No, no, it is.

2702
02:47:49,000 --> 02:47:53,000
This is the longest currently running stream of 2016.

2703
02:47:53,000 --> 02:47:55,000
No, it's not.

2704
02:47:55,000 --> 02:47:57,000
It's tied for first.

2705
02:47:57,000 --> 02:47:59,000
How do you know that?

2706
02:47:59,000 --> 02:48:03,000
Because you physically couldn't have been streaming longer.

2707
02:48:03,000 --> 02:48:07,000
Well, what if some, a bunch of other people that were streaming and were streaming at midnight exactly?

2708
02:48:07,000 --> 02:48:11,000
Yeah, well, you're tied for first.

2709
02:48:11,000 --> 02:48:13,000
This is the longest stream.

2710
02:48:13,000 --> 02:48:17,000
Yeah, yeah, yeah, I am tied for first right now.

2711
02:48:17,000 --> 02:48:21,000
So therefore, you're just like having a world record.

2712
02:48:21,000 --> 02:48:23,000
Yeah, I did say that.

2713
02:48:23,000 --> 02:48:29,000
But here, let's break this, before I end the stream, let's break this down for just a second.

2714
02:48:29,000 --> 02:48:35,000
So that was like, I was talking a lot about Overwatch and streaming Overwatch a lot.

2715
02:48:35,000 --> 02:48:39,000
And then they decided to pull the plug on it.

2716
02:48:39,000 --> 02:48:43,000
And I was like, oh, well, I can't play Overwatch anymore.

2717
02:48:43,000 --> 02:48:45,000
I need a game to stream.

2718
02:48:45,000 --> 02:48:47,000
And I didn't have a game to stream.

2719
02:48:47,000 --> 02:48:49,000
And then the holidays happened.

2720
02:48:49,000 --> 02:48:51,000
So there you go.

2721
02:48:51,000 --> 02:48:53,000
I agree.

2722
02:48:53,000 --> 02:48:55,000
But I'm back now.

2723
02:48:55,000 --> 02:48:57,000
I'm ready to go.

2724
02:48:57,000 --> 02:48:59,000
My dog is fine.

2725
02:48:59,000 --> 02:49:01,000
I'm fucking ready to go, guys.

2726
02:49:01,000 --> 02:49:03,000
I got a video going up probably the tomorrow the next day.

2727
02:49:03,000 --> 02:49:05,000
I'm fucking ready to go.

2728
02:49:05,000 --> 02:49:07,000
Oh, it's happy new year mountain time now.

2729
02:49:07,000 --> 02:49:09,000
Is it? No, no, it's not.

2730
02:49:09,000 --> 02:49:11,000
Yes, it is.

2731
02:49:11,000 --> 02:49:15,000
Happy New Year, you guys in the mountains.

2732
02:49:15,000 --> 02:49:19,000
Everybody in a mountain.

2733
02:49:19,000 --> 02:49:21,000
All you guys that live in the mountains.

2734
02:49:21,000 --> 02:49:23,000
Happy New Year.

2735
02:49:23,000 --> 02:49:25,000
Right?

2736
02:49:25,000 --> 02:49:27,000
At least I caught a good deal.

2737
02:49:27,000 --> 02:49:29,000
You were three out of four here.

2738
02:49:29,000 --> 02:49:31,000
You got three for four.

2739
02:49:35,000 --> 02:49:37,000
Time to redecorate.

2740
02:49:37,000 --> 02:49:39,000
Happy New Year, mountain, guys.

2741
02:49:39,000 --> 02:49:41,000
You got two East Coast West Coast.

2742
02:49:41,000 --> 02:49:45,000
United States, Europe, Asia, wherever you are.

2743
02:49:45,000 --> 02:49:47,000
Australia,

2744
02:49:47,000 --> 02:49:51,000
Antarctica, Africa.

2745
02:49:51,000 --> 02:49:53,000
Uruguay. Did I forget the continent?

2746
02:49:53,000 --> 02:49:55,000
You want to change equipment.

2747
02:49:55,000 --> 02:49:57,000
I wasn't listening.

2748
02:49:57,000 --> 02:50:01,000
I just know you didn't say Uruguay.

2749
02:50:01,000 --> 02:50:03,000
I did not. You're right.

2750
02:50:03,000 --> 02:50:05,000
Or the Congo.

2751
02:50:05,000 --> 02:50:07,000
No, I said Africa.

2752
02:50:07,000 --> 02:50:09,000
But you didn't say the Congo.

2753
02:50:09,000 --> 02:50:11,000
That's a specific place in.

2754
02:50:11,000 --> 02:50:13,000
Right.

2755
02:50:13,000 --> 02:50:15,000
You got to say like the Netherlands.

2756
02:50:15,000 --> 02:50:17,000
Yeah, West Coast is in an hour.

2757
02:50:17,000 --> 02:50:19,000
That's true.

2758
02:50:19,000 --> 02:50:21,000
That is true.

2759
02:50:21,000 --> 02:50:23,000
All you West Coasters.

2760
02:50:23,000 --> 02:50:25,000
All you West Coasters will see.

2761
02:50:25,000 --> 02:50:27,000
We'll see you soon.

2762
02:50:27,000 --> 02:50:33,000
We forgot the Bermuda triangle.

2763
02:50:33,000 --> 02:50:35,000
Oh, yeah.

2764
02:50:35,000 --> 02:50:37,000
Happy New Year, D.

2765
02:50:37,000 --> 02:50:39,000
Bermuda.

2766
02:50:39,000 --> 02:50:41,000
Prang, guys.

2767
02:50:41,000 --> 02:50:45,000
I just like fell asleep halfway through saying that.

2768
02:50:45,000 --> 02:50:47,000
Happy birthday.

2769
02:50:47,000 --> 02:50:49,000
Happy birthday.

2770
02:50:49,000 --> 02:50:51,000
You just said happy birthday.

2771
02:50:51,000 --> 02:50:53,000
You just said happy birthday.

2772
02:50:53,000 --> 02:50:55,000
What is my...
