1
00:00:00,229 --> 00:00:03,090
You've seen me do it, like a hundred times!

2
00:00:06,371 --> 00:00:07,351
You can't dodge them all!

3
00:00:16,014 --> 00:00:17,234
He's turning!

4
00:00:17,874 --> 00:00:18,914
Oh shit, he's turning!

5
00:00:19,455 --> 00:00:20,695
He just growled at us!

6
00:00:29,901 --> 00:00:57,809
He just turned and growled Okay, I need to get my bearings Okay, we're good Okay, I'm gonna beat a fist

7
00:01:05,691 --> 00:01:11,636
I can't laugh at too hard.

8
00:01:11,716 --> 00:01:12,697
Of course I know.

9
00:01:13,038 --> 00:01:14,599
The horse has to dodge.

10
00:01:15,120 --> 00:01:21,726
I've pressed it probably 5,000 times in the course of the last two weeks.

11
00:01:22,726 --> 00:01:23,547
I'm gonna die.

12
00:01:59,980 --> 00:02:00,960
That was really funny.

13
00:02:02,640 --> 00:02:04,661
I would like to continue to play the game.

14
00:02:05,201 --> 00:02:06,101
That would be swell.

15
00:02:11,962 --> 00:02:13,042
Everyone, you growled at us?

16
00:02:13,062 --> 00:02:25,345
I need to see it.

17
00:02:26,185 --> 00:02:26,885
I have to see it.

18
00:02:31,334 --> 00:02:32,094
I need to see it.

19
00:02:34,856 --> 00:02:35,256
Is this it?

20
00:02:36,236 --> 00:02:36,637
Hold on.

21
00:02:37,177 --> 00:02:37,817
We need to watch this.

22
00:02:37,897 --> 00:02:40,999
I need to examine this because I- I don't know what the fuck- I don't know what the fuck happened.

23
00:02:45,181 --> 00:02:50,723
Holy fucking god, I look like a weirdo.

24
00:02:57,526 --> 00:02:58,627
Oh my god, dude.

25
00:03:04,453 --> 00:03:05,614
Why does it sound so weird?

26
00:03:06,295 --> 00:03:07,776
Why does it sound so weird?

27
00:03:12,139 --> 00:03:15,061
What's wrong with this?

28
00:03:15,341 --> 00:03:16,342
Is that what I sound like?

29
00:03:22,806 --> 00:03:24,608
Why do I sound like a fucking cave troll?

30
00:03:35,828 --> 00:03:36,769
It doesn't sound much better.

31
00:03:36,789 --> 00:03:43,033
He's like, he's turning.

32
00:03:43,533 --> 00:03:44,694
Oh shit, he's turning.

33
00:03:45,274 --> 00:03:46,535
He just growled at us.

34
00:03:51,038 --> 00:03:54,240
Oh my fucking god, dude.

35
00:04:00,404 --> 00:04:02,986
Somebody said, Tim the tool man.

36
00:04:13,274 --> 00:04:18,315
Honestly, man, if somebody asks you, if somebody says, hey dude, do you know there's a dodge in the game?

37
00:04:18,335 --> 00:04:19,955
It's like, bro.

38
00:04:22,016 --> 00:04:22,616
Yes.

39
00:04:32,218 --> 00:04:34,298
They're a fundamental part of the whole game.

40
00:04:34,318 --> 00:04:34,358
Oh.

41
00:04:48,869 --> 00:04:49,159
Alright.
