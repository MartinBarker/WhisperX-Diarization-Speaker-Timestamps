00:00.229 --> 00:03.090
You've seen me do it, like a hundred times!

00:06.371 --> 00:07.351
You can't dodge them all!

00:16.014 --> 00:17.234
He's turning!

00:17.874 --> 00:18.914
Oh shit, he's turning!

00:19.455 --> 00:20.695
He just growled at us!

00:29.901 --> 00:57.809
He just turned and growled Okay, I need to get my bearings Okay, we're good Okay, I'm gonna beat a fist

01:05.691 --> 01:11.636
I can't laugh at too hard.

01:11.716 --> 01:12.697
Of course I know.

01:13.038 --> 01:14.599
The horse has to dodge.

01:15.120 --> 01:21.726
I've pressed it probably 5,000 times in the course of the last two weeks.

01:22.726 --> 01:23.547
I'm gonna die.

01:59.980 --> 02:00.960
That was really funny.

02:02.640 --> 02:04.661
I would like to continue to play the game.

02:05.201 --> 02:06.101
That would be swell.

02:11.962 --> 02:13.042
Everyone, you growled at us?

02:13.062 --> 02:25.345
I need to see it.

02:26.185 --> 02:26.885
I have to see it.

02:31.334 --> 02:32.094
I need to see it.

02:34.856 --> 02:35.256
Is this it?

02:36.236 --> 02:36.637
Hold on.

02:37.177 --> 02:37.817
We need to watch this.

02:37.897 --> 02:40.999
I need to examine this because I- I don't know what the fuck- I don't know what the fuck happened.

02:45.181 --> 02:50.723
Holy fucking god, I look like a weirdo.

02:57.526 --> 02:58.627
Oh my god, dude.

03:04.453 --> 03:05.614
Why does it sound so weird?

03:06.295 --> 03:07.776
Why does it sound so weird?

03:12.139 --> 03:15.061
What's wrong with this?

03:15.341 --> 03:16.342
Is that what I sound like?

03:22.806 --> 03:24.608
Why do I sound like a fucking cave troll?

03:35.828 --> 03:36.769
It doesn't sound much better.

03:36.789 --> 03:43.033
He's like, he's turning.

03:43.533 --> 03:44.694
Oh shit, he's turning.

03:45.274 --> 03:46.535
He just growled at us.

03:51.038 --> 03:54.240
Oh my fucking god, dude.

04:00.404 --> 04:02.986
Somebody said, Tim the tool man.

04:13.274 --> 04:18.315
Honestly, man, if somebody asks you, if somebody says, hey dude, do you know there's a dodge in the game?

04:18.335 --> 04:19.955
It's like, bro.

04:22.016 --> 04:22.616
Yes.

04:32.218 --> 04:34.298
They're a fundamental part of the whole game.

04:34.318 --> 04:34.358
Oh.

04:48.869 --> 04:49.159
Alright.
