00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,000
Hi!

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:10,000
Hello, everyone. German 985 here.

3
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:13,000
Hello, everyone. German 985.

4
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:16,000
Oh, well, you can't lie to him like that.

5
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:19,000
What's up, guys?

6
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:22,000
Did anyone believe it?

7
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:25,000
No one's even here to hear it, so.

8
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:28,000
Yeah, there are like 15-20 people already here.

9
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:31,000
Oh, you're on Twitch, mother.

10
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:34,000
I am on the Twitch-itch.

11
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:37,000
Anyways, happy Saturday.

12
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:40,000
Happy Sunday if you're from a different country.

13
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:46,000
And let me show this out to people's.

14
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:49,000
Actually, I got to write, uh, app.

15
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:51,000
And they'll see.

16
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:55,000
Oh, come on.

17
00:00:55,000 --> 00:01:02,000
Well, how come I can't bring up Brett, as I can app mentioned?

18
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:04,000
Maybe he blew up his Twitter.

19
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:07,000
MLC stealth.

20
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:10,000
Like, I'm not even doing you either.

21
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:13,000
What's going on here, Twitter?

22
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:15,000
Twitter, what is going on?

23
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:18,000
Why are you being like this?

24
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:21,000
I'm going to tweet, too.

25
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:24,000
You could just retweet what I tweet.

26
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:27,000
You can all tweet.

27
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:28,000
You can pick your dog.

28
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:30,000
You can tweet, I tweet, but you can't.

29
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:33,000
We all tweet for germistry.

30
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:35,000
And there we go.

31
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:38,000
With at MLs.

32
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:40,000
Okay, why that was weird.

33
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:47,000
I don't know why it didn't work before.

34
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:53,000
I wonder who that is.

35
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:55,000
And tweet.

36
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:56,000
No, no, no, tweet.

37
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:57,000
Come to it yet.

38
00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:00,000
Because I need to, uh, write it.

39
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:01,000
I already tweeted.

40
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:02,000
Oh, no, it is.

41
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:05,000
Oh, no, no, no, I was talking to myself, not to you.

42
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:08,000
Like, as I was telling myself, because I was going to hit the Twitter button.

43
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:10,000
And I didn't even put like the link.

44
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:14,000
So I was like, no, no.

45
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:16,000
It has been Twittered.

46
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:19,000
And yes, it has.

47
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:20,000
And there's Twitter.

48
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:24,000
Now go to YouTube.

49
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:29,000
And post that.

50
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:35,000
And then get out of there, because it's not necessary.

51
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:37,000
And set it stream.

52
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:41,000
Which means you're going to find, okay.

53
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:46,000
Good evening.

54
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:48,000
I'm going to play some team fortress too.

55
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:53,000
And then if you guys don't know, they just put out a huge, huge CS go update.

56
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:58,000
So that should be interesting to check out for sure.

57
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:04,000
It's probably one of the big, they've added like five maps.

58
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:07,000
I would love to express my enthusiasm for that.

59
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:09,000
But the last.

60
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:10,000
I cannot.

61
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:11,000
You don't have it.

62
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:12,000
I don't have it.

63
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:15,000
No.

64
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:18,000
I'm not going to go out.

65
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:23,000
Yeah, I think they're going to release us coming soon.

66
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:26,000
I think it's coming soon.

67
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:32,000
Otherwise did the update today was pretty huge.

68
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:37,000
You know, Val, though, it's going to be months, probably.

69
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:38,000
Yeah, yeah, true.

70
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:40,000
Very true.

71
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:42,000
Good evening, everyone.

72
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:43,000
I'll give that a saying.

73
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:48,000
I bid you go tomorrow and go tidings.

74
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:49,000
So let's get rolling.

75
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:55,000
I'm else he stealth is here, but he's currently, he's currently in the bathroom.

76
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:58,000
And that's all we're going to say about that.

77
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:05,000
So let's find a server that is an empty.

78
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:09,000
Do we need to wait for him before we join a server so that he can play?

79
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:11,000
Yeah, he's going to have to deal with it.

80
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:12,000
Oh, there you go.

81
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:13,000
There he is.

82
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:15,000
Perfect timing, sir.

83
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:16,000
Thank you.

84
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:19,000
I was waiting for the right moment to enter.

85
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:22,000
And I want to see pretty good.

86
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:25,000
No, I was watching clips from the on to generous show.

87
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:27,000
Why are you doing that?

88
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:29,000
She's funny.

89
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:30,000
Sorry, I'm late.

90
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:34,000
You're supposed to be in the stream.

91
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:37,000
Now let's get into the server.

92
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:39,000
Let's try to find a 32.

93
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:40,000
Here we go.

94
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:41,000
CPU badlands.

95
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:42,000
I don't know.

96
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:46,000
I want to do CPU badlands.

97
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:47,000
This is 28.

98
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:49,000
That's two fours.

99
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:50,000
It's trading.

100
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:51,000
Oh, here we go.

101
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:53,000
This is two out of 24.

102
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:54,000
All right, you guys ready?

103
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:55,000
Not quite yet.

104
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:56,000
Oh, you better hurry up.

105
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:57,000
I'm launching it.

106
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:59,000
It's already on that screen.

107
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:00,000
It's already on screen.

108
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:02,000
I've already got Xbox connected.

109
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:03,000
My console ready to go.

110
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:05,000
Wait a couple seconds.

111
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:07,000
By the way, if you guys may,

112
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:09,000
they never will know who's stealth is,

113
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:11,000
but some people may not know who you are.

114
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:13,000
Alex got to give an introduction.

115
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:15,000
Hey guys, my name is italics.

116
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:17,000
And I make YouTube videos.

117
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:19,000
And my channel name is gamers descent,

118
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:22,000
which you may know me by instead of italics.

119
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:24,000
That is where I hail from.

120
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:29,000
Yeah, you come from the the monitoring top of gamers descent.

121
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:30,000
What time is it right now?

122
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:32,000
It is 15 after six.

123
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:34,000
If people ever just saying that.

124
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:36,000
All right, I'm ready.

125
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:38,000
What we going to say is Alex before I cut you off?

126
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:39,000
I don't.

127
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:40,000
Woo.

128
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:42,000
I don't know.

129
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:43,000
I guess to further introduce myself,

130
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:45,000
I'm a machinima realm director.

131
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:51,000
So I'm on the other side of the chasm between the two machinima mountains.

132
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:52,000
I come in peace.

133
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:53,000
Here we go.

134
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:54,000
People have already started joining.

135
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:55,000
Let's do it.

136
00:05:55,000 --> 00:06:01,000
68.177.101.

137
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:13,000
It's steht et et et et et, Fen

138
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:15,000
4,

139
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:19,000
haul in 270-16.

140
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:22,000
oh I can't film me.

141
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:26,000
16, I won.

142
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:29,000
Well you better get in there.

143
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:31,000
Put TF2 Moa hunting.

144
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:40,000
TF2 Moa hunting. All you're going to do is get 25 kills in a row. That's very difficult to do in this game.

145
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:49,000
That is not an easy thing to do in Team Fortress to get more than I'd say more than 15 kills in a row. 10 kills in a row is even like a pretty big field strength.

146
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:53,000
The only one who could do it is a engineer.

147
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:59,000
Yeah, how heavy to have you can get a lot of engineer if nobody is like smart and going dimmer manner.

148
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:02,000
Oh, over medic.

149
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:06,000
I went on zero red team.

150
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:10,000
How does the game audio? Let's take a look.

151
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:12,000
That's all right.

152
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:16,000
How's the game audio guys? Good.

153
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:17,000
You're good.

154
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:18,000
I cannot tell.

155
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:22,000
Are you going to tell them what's your name is?

156
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:25,000
I think people will probably figure it out by now.

157
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:28,000
Dick Simmons, the dump champion.

158
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:34,000
Oh, where's this scout going?

159
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:40,000
It's pretty nice fire gun, dude.

160
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:42,000
Oh, I thought it was you.

161
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:45,000
Oh, watch it. Watch it.

162
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:47,000
Look up the still.

163
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:52,000
Oh, forgot fire kills me.

164
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:54,000
It's going up pretty well here.

165
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:57,000
What do I have for a melee right now?

166
00:07:57,000 --> 00:08:00,000
Actually, I got the postal pommel.

167
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:02,000
Let's try and get some postal pommel.

168
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:06,000
Yeah, you know, you're not spying.

169
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:08,000
I need a medic.

170
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:10,000
Oh, that's.

171
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:13,000
Oh, yeah, we did it game over.

172
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:16,000
Did a job team.

173
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:18,000
So we can do it again.

174
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:22,000
Very cool.

175
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:25,000
Oh, we changed.

176
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:27,000
I wanted to play on upwards.

177
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:28,000
Oh, I love upward.

178
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:29,000
I love it too.

179
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:32,000
Upward is one of my favorites.

180
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:34,000
Upward.

181
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:39,000
What do we know?

182
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:42,000
My most kills is only 25 as a sniper.

183
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:44,000
I've only gotten one moeab.

184
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:45,000
I have no idea.

185
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:46,000
Oh, I thought I'm out.

186
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:47,000
Good. I love Thunderbomb.

187
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:49,000
I like the first two stages.

188
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:50,000
Thunder Mountain.

189
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:53,000
Jerma, can I be has in a hug?

190
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:55,000
If you ask him for a hug, get ready.

191
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:56,000
Internet hug.

192
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:57,000
There we are.

193
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:59,000
He, he, he, be has him in your hug.

194
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:00,000
Here we go.

195
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:02,000
He has been in.

196
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:04,000
Here comes the internet hug.

197
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:05,000
You can do it.

198
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:07,000
You just received the internet hug.

199
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:10,000
Look, worth $15.

200
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:12,000
You got hugs.

201
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:14,000
That's actually pretty good.

202
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:16,000
You've got mail.

203
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:17,000
Oh, I have a new item.

204
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:18,000
Oh, I got a new item.

205
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:19,000
I'm giving away my backpack.

206
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:21,000
I finally got some new stuff.

207
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:25,000
Why am I even running?

208
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:26,000
Waiting for players.

209
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:27,000
What are we going?

210
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:30,000
You guys, no one's got to give me stuff.

211
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:33,000
I mean, items are one thing.

212
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:35,000
I have a, a nice plan.

213
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:37,000
As you probably saw in my latest video, if you haven't,

214
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:40,000
I'm going to do a crate unboxing video.

215
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:43,000
Whatever I get in those crates,

216
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:45,000
if I get an unusual or something,

217
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:47,000
it's going to be given away.

218
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:49,000
So any unusual I get in the boxes,

219
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:50,000
is going to be given away.

220
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:52,000
And if I get strangers, they might.

221
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:53,000
I'm keeping them.

222
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:58,000
We got, we got a full server.

223
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:01,000
I will prop the 24.

224
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:05,000
Yeah, there's five spectators.

225
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:08,000
Make sure some people are kind of stuck in the spectator right now.

226
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:15,000
But the unboxing video will probably be next week, how to zoom.

227
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:18,000
I do, you share.

228
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:20,000
Take seven, the dump champion.

229
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:21,000
Yeah, that's me.

230
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:23,000
Dick Simmons, the dump champion.

231
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:27,000
Wait, did you put end quotes on that?

232
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:29,000
I think this is the parrots parentheses.

233
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:32,000
That's all, I know.

234
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:34,000
It should be on this screen.

235
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:36,000
I don't think so.

236
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:39,000
I've been wrong before though.

237
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:42,000
All right, I close my door there.

238
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:44,000
Should be as not on this stream.

239
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:46,000
Not in the chat anyway.

240
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:48,000
No, I'm not that I can see.

241
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:49,000
High five.

242
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:50,000
Frank.

243
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:55,000
Can I just kill somebody already?

244
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:56,000
We got away.

245
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:57,000
Is that a time, man?

246
00:10:57,000 --> 00:11:00,000
I want to blow them underneath the fence.

247
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:02,000
Well, I ever played Don of War II.

248
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:04,000
Oh, man, I was a huge Don of War I fan.

249
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:07,000
I don't really like what they did with Don of War II.

250
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:08,000
I'm not going to lie.

251
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:11,000
Wasn't a big Don of War II person.

252
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:13,000
Oh, my God.

253
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:16,000
Oh, I forgot another shotgun.

254
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:18,000
Still pretty good.

255
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:20,000
Oh, thanks.

256
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:22,000
Covered in the G.A. Verody.

257
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:24,000
I'm going to puke as I get.

258
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:27,000
Derody makes me puke.

259
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:28,000
Oh, my God.

260
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:30,000
Derody. Get out of here.

261
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:31,000
Conqueror.

262
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:32,000
Contrary.

263
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:33,000
No.

264
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:35,000
I can't believe how many no points I got right there.

265
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:36,000
Oh, no.

266
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:37,000
Damn it.

267
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:39,000
I thought I had more rockets loaded.

268
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:40,000
SHIT.

269
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:43,000
What does that spell shoot?

270
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:45,000
Gosh darn it.

271
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:46,000
Oh, good.

272
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:50,000
That's what that spells.

273
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:51,000
Boom.

274
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:52,000
Boom.

275
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:53,000
Who am I streaming with?

276
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:55,000
MLC stealth and italics.

277
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:59,000
Two pros.

278
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:01,000
We play games.

279
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:03,000
Sometimes we are special.

280
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:05,000
Sometimes we play video games.

281
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:07,000
Occasionally.

282
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:09,000
Sometimes we laugh.

283
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:10,000
Sometimes we cry.

284
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:13,000
Sometimes we share valuable moments together that make us better.

285
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:15,000
Oh, he's going to get away.

286
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:17,000
I refuse to let him get away.

287
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:20,000
He's going to get behind everybody.

288
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:22,000
He's going to get behind us all.

289
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:23,000
I think he already is.

290
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:25,000
Oh, he's gone.

291
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:29,000
Nine health and I'm jumping off of high surfaces.

292
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:30,000
Oh, hi.

293
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:31,000
I survived.

294
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:35,000
Give me that health.

295
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:37,000
Can you donate an unusual...

296
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:40,000
I thought you were about to say can you dig at the sucker?

297
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:42,000
I would rather you hang onto that.

298
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:44,000
I don't need anything.

299
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:45,000
You know, you don't have to give me stuff.

300
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:46,000
Booker tea.

301
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:47,000
Best surely an unusual.

302
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:49,000
Because an unusual is worth a lot.

303
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:52,000
And I don't want to take stuff like that from people.

304
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:54,000
So.

305
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:57,000
Oh, did I make it?

306
00:12:57,000 --> 00:13:00,000
Oh, my God.

307
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:02,000
That was a good shot.

308
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:10,000
That guy caught me right when I was coming down.

309
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:16,000
Oh, I got to take off the conqueror.

310
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:17,000
Conqueror is...

311
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:19,000
Oh, man.

312
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:21,000
I'm not feeling the conqueror.

313
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:22,000
I'm not right now.

314
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:25,000
Oh, damn.

315
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:32,000
That was in the face.

316
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:35,000
Oh.

317
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:37,000
What's it?

318
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:38,000
I'm taking this off.

319
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:40,000
I'm going to put on...

320
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:42,000
What am I going to put on?

321
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:43,000
I'm going to put on the shotgun.

322
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:46,000
The strange shotgun I still have to give these away.

323
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:48,000
I have given my third...

324
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:50,000
I've given 33% of the back pack away so far.

325
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:53,000
Two more people I have to get in contact with.

326
00:13:53,000 --> 00:14:00,000
And then after that, it is start all over again.

327
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:06,000
All right, I'm going medic.

328
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:07,000
Yeah, we could use...

329
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:08,000
We only got one.

330
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:10,000
Oh, actually, you are the one.

331
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:11,000
You just switched.

332
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:12,000
Actually, there's two, I think.

333
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:13,000
Are he's medicing?

334
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:14,000
Oh, we...

335
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:18,000
Oh, okay, okay, I got to see.

336
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:22,000
So, which one is Java?

337
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:27,000
I swear, it's not Dixim and the Dump Champion.

338
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:30,000
That is a spy.

339
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:33,000
Oh, no.

340
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:34,000
If I see...

341
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:39,000
Is it Uba, a charge?

342
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:41,000
What classes are you guys playing us right now?

343
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:42,000
I'm soldier.

344
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:44,000
Oh, no.

345
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:46,000
Oh, so little hell.

346
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:50,000
I am the same time.

347
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:52,000
What are my video settings on here?

348
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:54,000
I'll show you.

349
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:57,000
Video 1280 by 720, because I'm running in a window right now.

350
00:14:57,000 --> 00:14:59,000
I'm going to be able to stream it.

351
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:04,000
But I play on high, high, high, simple, medium, disabled, color correction,

352
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:05,000
and then all these other things.

353
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:08,000
I don't play with anti-aliasing on.

354
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:14,000
I feel like the amount of resources it takes to the amount of gain you get is not really that noticeable.

355
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:16,000
At least in my opinion.

356
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:19,000
Is it at least for a game like this?

357
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:23,000
Oh, thank you for putting me out of fire, Tyro.

358
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:26,000
I always play with B-Sync God.

359
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:27,000
Always.

360
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:28,000
I'm changing.

361
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:30,000
I'm changing to engineer.

362
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:39,000
Do I play any commonly hated games?

363
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:41,000
Oh, backstab. Turn around, spy.

364
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:43,000
Do you guys play any commonly hated games?

365
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:45,000
Is outside our door?

366
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:47,000
Any commonly hated-cated?

367
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:48,000
I call it duty.

368
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:50,000
What would fall under that?

369
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:51,000
That's fine.

370
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:52,000
Number one right there.

371
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:53,000
Yes, stealth.

372
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:54,000
Answer it, yes.

373
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:57,000
Stealth does play commonly hated games.

374
00:15:57,000 --> 00:15:58,000
Call it duty.

375
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:04,000
But like actually hated like literally bad games, I don't know.

376
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:11,000
Yeah, I don't think I play any really hated games.

377
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:13,000
Oh, there's the sniper again.

378
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:16,000
We still got a level 1 up.

379
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:18,000
Oh, I think I've had a score.

380
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:19,000
Oh, come on.

381
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:21,000
Is this guy hacking?

382
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:22,000
Come on, let me see.

383
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:25,000
I see a spy on their team running around in his taunts.

384
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:29,000
And he looks like a wax figure just moving around.

385
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:30,000
Skating around.

386
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:33,000
It's probably a glitch or something.

387
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:35,000
Yeah, I saw that earlier too.

388
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:37,000
I think it is just a glitch.

389
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:40,000
But even when he was disguised, it was just walking around.

390
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:44,000
It's like not moving.

391
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:47,000
Like arms in the air.

392
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:49,000
Oh, I got a change this.

393
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:51,000
I don't got a change that one.

394
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:53,000
You got to change it.

395
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:55,000
Oh, I got to hurry the hell up.

396
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:57,000
Oh, boy.

397
00:16:57,000 --> 00:16:58,000
Do you engineer?

398
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:00,000
I was a second behind.

399
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:02,000
I threw my games off-road off now.

400
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:03,000
What is this?

401
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:05,000
Like an RTS?

402
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:08,000
I've got to catch up.

403
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:11,000
My actions permitted is only a hundred.

404
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:12,000
Let's go.

405
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:13,000
Let's go.

406
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:17,000
A genuine hood.

407
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:19,000
What's the best scattergun for the scout?

408
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:20,000
They're all good.

409
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:23,000
It depends on how you play stylons.

410
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:27,000
Mid-range, too long-range, use the shortstop.

411
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:31,000
Close-range, meat shots, force nature, and everything else kind of in between.

412
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:33,000
The regular scatterguns are probably the best.

413
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:35,000
At least that's kind of how I see it.

414
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:36,000
I like that one the best.

415
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:37,000
No, I got to go over here.

416
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:38,000
What am I doing?

417
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:39,000
Oh, god.

418
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:40,000
I've already spurted this up.

419
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:43,000
And I salvage this is the real question.

420
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:44,000
That's the real question.

421
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:46,000
Can I salvage this?

422
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:49,000
What am I doing?

423
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:50,000
I don't know where I want to put it.

424
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:51,000
I don't know what I want to do.

425
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:53,000
I'm so torn right now.

426
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:55,000
This guy's right here.

427
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:57,000
No, I'm putting it right here.

428
00:17:57,000 --> 00:17:58,000
The limb of the limb of the limb.

429
00:17:58,000 --> 00:17:59,000
That was so torn.

430
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:05,000
My brain couldn't not handle what I was just doing right here.

431
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:07,000
Oh, lord.

432
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:11,000
Oh, this is going down in two seconds.

433
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:12,000
I have absolutely...

434
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:13,000
Oh, lag.

435
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:14,000
Oh, yeah, I got that too.

436
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:19,000
Super lag.

437
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:21,000
Is that the real emulsie stealth?

438
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:22,000
I hope so.

439
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:26,000
Oh, I'm getting a lot of lag.

440
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:28,000
Thank you, Engineer, for helping me build this.

441
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:32,000
Appreciate it.

442
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:34,000
And let's reload.

443
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:36,000
Is that the real emulsie stealth?

444
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:41,000
Oh, yeah.

445
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:43,000
All right, I got some catching up to doing points.

446
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:45,000
This is kind of getting embarrassing.

447
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:46,000
Oh, my gosh.

448
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:47,000
Here comes...

449
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:48,000
Oh, there goes the dispenser.

450
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:49,000
Oh, my God.

451
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:51,000
Oh, he's up top.

452
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:53,000
Oh.

453
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:54,000
That just ruined my life.

454
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:55,000
Oh, there's that flag in.

455
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:56,000
Unmoving.

456
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:58,000
Yeah, I got him.

457
00:18:58,000 --> 00:18:59,000
Or maybe you did ring too much.

458
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:02,000
We're going this.

459
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:09,000
I like this better.

460
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:12,000
I don't feel as bad when I lose all my stuff.

461
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:14,000
Oh, spy.

462
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:16,000
Doing his thing.

463
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:18,000
I think that...

464
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:19,000
Oh, my word.

465
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:21,000
He is doing his thing, isn't he?

466
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:23,000
Get away, Romani.

467
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:24,000
He's not dead.

468
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:26,000
Oh, he is not dead.

469
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:28,000
I didn't get the...

470
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:31,000
I'm going to duel with him right now.

471
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:32,000
Oh, yeah.

472
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:34,000
Yeah, so I didn't get the...

473
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:37,000
I don't know, everyone.

474
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:40,000
Find him on the cart.

475
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:43,000
Oh, my God.

476
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:46,000
You're all right, Doc.

477
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:49,000
Oh, run away.

478
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:52,000
I want it up here.

479
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:55,000
They're about to get to the point.

480
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:57,000
They almost say...

481
00:19:57,000 --> 00:19:58,000
Oh, crap thing.

482
00:19:58,000 --> 00:19:59,000
Oh, no, no, no, where's he?

483
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:00,000
Oh, no.

484
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:01,000
Give it up.

485
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:03,000
Oh, my God, Roy.

486
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:08,000
Oh, this guy's still going to get me.

487
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:10,000
Oh, no.

488
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:16,000
Oh, I can't believe I'm still alive.

489
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:18,000
Oh, they got it.

490
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:20,000
No, I was dead.

491
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:23,000
I was toast right here.

492
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:25,000
I was toast.

493
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:29,000
Oh, I love butter toast.

494
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:30,000
What's name tag?

495
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:32,000
I think the chat...

496
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:34,000
The chat frees for anybody else.

497
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:36,000
I think the chat is for me.

498
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:38,000
Somebody has found a name tag.

499
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:40,000
What's that mean?

500
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:42,000
I don't think the chat froze.

501
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:45,000
I was looking at it and I was like, wait, no, nothing.

502
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:47,000
Oh, they're going to...

503
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:49,000
They got a heavy medic right here.

504
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:51,000
Get rid of that medic.

505
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:54,000
Oh, my God.

506
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:57,000
When all else fails, just duck and cover.

507
00:20:57,000 --> 00:20:58,000
Well, I'll just fry it.

508
00:20:58,000 --> 00:21:00,000
I didn't know you found that stuff though.

509
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:02,000
Didn't know you found the name tags.

510
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:03,000
I thought you had a biome.

511
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:04,000
You can find it.

512
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:05,000
No, I think.

513
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:06,000
You can find it.

514
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:07,000
You can find it.

515
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:08,000
You can find it.

516
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:09,000
He's in the front door.

517
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:10,000
Frasier, you can find it.

518
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:11,000
Oh, there's spies surfing around in the base.

519
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:12,000
There's two spies.

520
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:13,000
I think sitting outside our doors.

521
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:15,000
Oh, God, he's over here.

522
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:17,000
No, wait, that's not even mine.

523
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:19,000
That's not my century.

524
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:21,000
I'm really losing it here, guys.

525
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:24,000
My brain can't even handle what I'm doing.

526
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:26,000
Oh, get out of my way.

527
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:28,000
No, no, no, no.

528
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:35,000
Oh, I just barely saved that.

529
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:36,000
So many people.

530
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:37,000
So much death.

531
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:39,000
Try to get this dispenser up.

532
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:40,000
Oh, I was primed.

533
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:42,000
I know you're not dead.

534
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:43,000
He could.

535
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:45,000
Wow.

536
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:46,000
Oh, okay.

537
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:47,000
I'm going out there.

538
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:50,000
Someone's going to get toasted out there.

539
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:53,000
Oh, it's probably going to be me.

540
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:54,000
Is that you, Dick?

541
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:56,000
Was that you?

542
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:57,000
Is it just who walked right next to me?

543
00:21:57,000 --> 00:21:58,000
Was that the spy?

544
00:21:58,000 --> 00:21:59,000
Is that you, Richard?

545
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:01,000
Yeah, that's me.

546
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:03,000
Hello.

547
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:04,000
What are you doing, Richard?

548
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:05,000
Yeah.

549
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:08,000
Oh, get the medic.

550
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:09,000
Oh, yeah.

551
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:12,000
I went from like last place, like fourth place in one line.

552
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:13,000
Oh, my God.

553
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:14,000
Oh, my God.

554
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:16,000
What's ringing out?

555
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:17,000
That's it.

556
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:18,000
I'm just as fond.

557
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:19,000
I am.

558
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:20,000
Wow.

559
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:21,000
Hi.

560
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:22,000
What happened?

561
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:23,000
Hold on, hold on.

562
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:23,000
That's going to be cool.

563
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:25,000
Sorry, I was talking to my man.

564
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:26,000
I'm going to get back to that.

565
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:27,000
That's a spy.

566
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:28,000
No.

567
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:29,000
Oh.

568
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:30,000
Oh.

569
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:31,000
Oh.

570
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:32,000
Oh.

571
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:34,000
Well, shoot.

572
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:35,000
God.

573
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:36,000
Oh, God.

574
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:37,000
There we go.

575
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:39,000
This is what I'm talking about.

576
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:40,000
Ow.

577
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:41,000
What the fuck?

578
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:42,000
I'm on the scoreboard, boys.

579
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:46,000
I have faith in your German.

580
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:50,000
I wonder if I will play, you think, uh, I read it.

581
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:52,000
I wonder if German is nice.

582
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:53,000
What the hell was that?

583
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:54,000
What the hell was that?

584
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:57,000
Just give a nice gun in place, but at the end of that hallway right there.

585
00:22:57,000 --> 00:22:59,000
Yeah, I'm trying to, I can turn it.

586
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:00,000
I keep destroying it.

587
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:03,000
I got some people that know what they're doing.

588
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:07,000
I probably will play zombie fortress at some point.

589
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:09,000
Probably not tonight, though.

590
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:10,000
What?

591
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:11,000
Zombie fortress.

592
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:12,000
I'm just going into punches.

593
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:13,000
I don't even care.

594
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:15,000
Room my knockin' out with one punch.

595
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:16,000
I'm just going to get a punch.

596
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:17,000
I'm just going to get a punch.

597
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:18,000
I'm just going to get a punch.

598
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:20,000
Room my knockin' out with one punch.

599
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:23,000
You're getting knocked out, run up, oh!

600
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:25,000
Oh, come on, feel the pain.

601
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:27,000
Feel it.

602
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:28,000
I would've killed them, too.

603
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:31,000
Oh, fuck, let's try, let's get one shot.

604
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:36,000
Uh, just set the next level to where we're going.

605
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:38,000
We're changing server after this, anyway, so.

606
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:39,000
Oh.

607
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:41,000
Alright.

608
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:43,000
Well, that answers that question.

609
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:44,000
We're changing server.

610
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:45,000
Just to...

611
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:48,000
People want to know, Jerma, what is zombie fortress?

612
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:49,000
I, uh, I don't know.

613
00:23:49,000 --> 00:23:51,000
I think it's like kind of like...

614
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:53,000
Oh my god.

615
00:23:53,000 --> 00:23:55,000
Everybody plays as...

616
00:23:55,000 --> 00:23:58,000
Oh, I think everyone has melee except for a small group of people.

617
00:23:58,000 --> 00:23:59,000
Somebody explain it.

618
00:23:59,000 --> 00:24:02,000
Oh, so it's like infection on Halo.

619
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:03,000
Hey, you're not me.

620
00:24:03,000 --> 00:24:05,000
Or whatever that game mode's called.

621
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:06,000
I think I know what you're talking about.

622
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:07,000
Yeah, it's like...

623
00:24:07,000 --> 00:24:12,000
It's kind of like a zombie mode where everyone runs around with melee except for the small group of people that don't have...

624
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:14,000
They're like the not zombies.

625
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:19,000
If I'm wrong, somebody please correct me in the chat because I know it's something like that though.

626
00:24:19,000 --> 00:24:21,000
That's probably right.

627
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:23,000
Somebody said it's like Halo infection.

628
00:24:23,000 --> 00:24:24,000
Watch out for spies.

629
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:26,000
Oh, they got taken out everything.

630
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:28,000
I got to be a little bit sneakier with these centers.

631
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:30,000
And that's going to blow up and kill me.

632
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:31,000
And that's going to die.

633
00:24:31,000 --> 00:24:32,000
I said, alright.

634
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:34,000
I'm going, I'm going to go.

635
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:36,000
I'm going to S.

636
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:38,000
How are you playing S. Heavy?

637
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:40,000
I am playing S. Heavy.

638
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:42,000
See, Scout is what I rage quit as.

639
00:24:43,000 --> 00:24:44,000
I like to run around.

640
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:47,000
I start his scout and then I'm like, okay, I suck.

641
00:24:47,000 --> 00:24:50,000
Moving on to the heavy where I can actually kill people.

642
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:52,000
I like this setup.

643
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:54,000
I'll stick with this.

644
00:24:58,000 --> 00:25:00,000
Whoa, I heard it backstabbed.

645
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:02,000
I'm standing in the corner.

646
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:05,000
Oh, God.

647
00:25:05,000 --> 00:25:07,000
Oh, I don't think he's dead.

648
00:25:07,000 --> 00:25:08,000
Maybe he is.

649
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:11,000
Man, we don't have any engineers do we?

650
00:25:13,000 --> 00:25:14,000
Oh, my.

651
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:16,000
Wait, what just happened to me?

652
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:18,000
What just even happened?

653
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:21,000
I got headshot from across the map.

654
00:25:21,000 --> 00:25:24,000
Oh, my God.

655
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:26,000
Oh, no, I just struck this.

656
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:28,000
We're about to lose.

657
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:30,000
We're about to lose.

658
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:32,000
Yeah, there's two spies on the point.

659
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:33,000
Oh, the car.

660
00:25:33,000 --> 00:25:34,000
We lost.

661
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:36,000
What are you guys going to get like a second spies?

662
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:39,000
How many spies are on that damn team?

663
00:25:43,000 --> 00:25:46,000
All right, new new server.

664
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:48,000
Not GG.

665
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:53,000
New S EV, RVV RV.

666
00:25:53,000 --> 00:25:56,000
Let's go to.

667
00:26:01,000 --> 00:26:03,000
Actually, hold on.

668
00:26:03,000 --> 00:26:06,000
I'm going to screen's going to go black for one second.

669
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:08,000
Because I'm going to change.

670
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:11,000
Then it's changed something real quick.

671
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:13,000
Well, you do that.

672
00:26:13,000 --> 00:26:15,000
I'll be RV for about 10 seconds.

673
00:26:15,000 --> 00:26:17,000
I'm going to see what my parents want.

674
00:26:17,000 --> 00:26:20,000
Well, because for some reason, when I was doing exploit in the game mode,

675
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:22,000
it was lagging my game a lot.

676
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:23,000
I don't know why.

677
00:26:23,000 --> 00:26:25,000
Sometimes I guess it does that.

678
00:26:25,000 --> 00:26:32,000
Yeah, are you using like the screen area or the other one?

679
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:33,000
I was doing the game source.

680
00:26:33,000 --> 00:26:35,000
That was like lagging my game sort of.

681
00:26:35,000 --> 00:26:37,000
All right, try screen area.

682
00:26:37,000 --> 00:26:41,000
I just did not change it over.

683
00:26:41,000 --> 00:26:44,000
I'm going to be like the release.

684
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:47,000
All right, let's go to.

685
00:26:47,000 --> 00:26:50,000
You got to be some fun too.

686
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:52,000
You got a dust fall.

687
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:54,000
High tower.

688
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:56,000
Hopefully stealth gets back soon.

689
00:26:56,000 --> 00:26:59,000
Otherwise, he's going to be in trouble.

690
00:26:59,000 --> 00:27:02,000
To delay for him when we were doing the test streaming,

691
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:05,000
I was using game source and it was working fine.

692
00:27:05,000 --> 00:27:08,000
So it just seems like on again, off again.

693
00:27:09,000 --> 00:27:11,000
Very hit or miss.

694
00:27:11,000 --> 00:27:13,000
That's all I got still.

695
00:27:13,000 --> 00:27:14,000
That's all I got.

696
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:17,000
That's your only, uh, that's my only delay.

697
00:27:17,000 --> 00:27:19,000
All right.

698
00:27:19,000 --> 00:27:21,000
That's better.

699
00:27:21,000 --> 00:27:24,000
Oh, it's so Joe.

700
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:26,000
How things going over here today?

701
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:27,000
Here we go.

702
00:27:27,000 --> 00:27:29,000
I'm from pasting it.

703
00:27:29,000 --> 00:27:31,000
Video and a stream.

704
00:27:31,000 --> 00:27:34,000
Just ballin' like a YouTuber does.

705
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:37,000
Ballin' straight ballin'.

706
00:27:37,000 --> 00:27:39,000
All right, stealth really, that's all I got.

707
00:27:39,000 --> 00:27:40,000
Now, now we're never man.

708
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:41,000
All right, 68.

709
00:27:41,000 --> 00:27:43,000
Dot 232.

710
00:27:43,000 --> 00:27:45,000
Dot 177.

711
00:27:45,000 --> 00:27:47,000
Dot 105.

712
00:27:47,000 --> 00:27:49,000
Callin' 27015.

713
00:27:49,000 --> 00:27:52,000
Sorry, stealth, you weren't here.

714
00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:56,000
But you missed out.

715
00:27:56,000 --> 00:27:57,000
That's the IP.

716
00:27:57,000 --> 00:28:01,000
Those of you are wondering.

717
00:28:01,000 --> 00:28:03,000
I hear somebody like here talking.

718
00:28:03,000 --> 00:28:05,000
Oh, is it?

719
00:28:05,000 --> 00:28:07,000
No, he's not making it.

720
00:28:07,000 --> 00:28:10,000
There's no way he makes it.

721
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:12,000
Hey, there's no way you make it.

722
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:14,000
There's no way he makes it.

723
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:17,000
I was gonna say, ask some bad news, bears.

724
00:28:17,000 --> 00:28:19,000
Dinner is ready with my parents.

725
00:28:19,000 --> 00:28:21,000
I was gonna probably go eat that with all my stuff.

726
00:28:21,000 --> 00:28:22,000
Dinner?

727
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:26,000
Well, it on like throw me out as a son.

728
00:28:29,000 --> 00:28:31,000
All right, well, yeah, see you later, dude.

729
00:28:31,000 --> 00:28:32,000
Thanks for coming.

730
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:33,000
Do you have no problem?

731
00:28:33,000 --> 00:28:35,000
I'm gonna miss you, buddy.

732
00:28:35,000 --> 00:28:37,000
Make sure you signify to this frame.

733
00:28:37,000 --> 00:28:38,000
Is that gonna miss you?

734
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:39,000
Oh, by screen.

735
00:28:39,000 --> 00:28:42,000
Thanks for having me.

736
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:44,000
See you guys later.

737
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:46,000
All right, I missed you guys.

738
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:47,000
Oh, I'm the host of the call.

739
00:28:47,000 --> 00:28:48,000
I'll just mute myself.

740
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:49,000
Oh, are you really?

741
00:28:49,000 --> 00:28:51,000
Just mute your...

742
00:28:51,000 --> 00:28:55,000
Yeah, now who should have hosted?

743
00:28:55,000 --> 00:28:56,000
Burbe?

744
00:28:56,000 --> 00:28:57,000
Yeah, I know.

745
00:28:57,000 --> 00:28:58,000
Well, the good thing I missed that,

746
00:28:58,000 --> 00:29:02,000
so I can do it again and miss it again.

747
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:05,000
I will play until you decide that you wanna play a CSGO.

748
00:29:05,000 --> 00:29:07,000
Then I will bow out as well.

749
00:29:07,000 --> 00:29:09,000
Yeah, thanks for sticking around it.

750
00:29:09,000 --> 00:29:12,000
Oh!

751
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:14,000
Tell my wife or is it hello?

752
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:17,000
Hello, wife.

753
00:29:17,000 --> 00:29:18,000
On the stream?

754
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:19,000
Was that a stream comment?

755
00:29:19,000 --> 00:29:21,000
Yeah, I guess.

756
00:29:21,000 --> 00:29:26,000
Why, stealth, why?

757
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:31,000
Stealth, how could you be so inconsiderate?

758
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:33,000
Wow.

759
00:29:33,000 --> 00:29:35,000
Oh, there's a lot of spice.

760
00:29:35,000 --> 00:29:38,000
I just wanna fly a hundred feet in the air.

761
00:29:38,000 --> 00:29:40,000
That's off to the spryme.

762
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:42,000
He doesn't mess around.

763
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:43,000
I'm running away.

764
00:29:43,000 --> 00:29:44,000
I'm running into spawn.

765
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:48,000
You can't get me a spawn.

766
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:49,000
Sorry.

767
00:29:49,000 --> 00:29:50,000
Text message.

768
00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:55,000
Do you ever have a problem where like you hit Am or something

769
00:29:55,000 --> 00:29:59,000
to change your loadout and then it opens like the options menu?

770
00:29:59,000 --> 00:30:02,000
It does that sometimes, you know.

771
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:04,000
Just curious.

772
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:08,000
That is an issue and now I'm gonna die right here.

773
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:11,000
That is an issue so I should get a tissue.

774
00:30:11,000 --> 00:30:12,000
You know what?

775
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:13,000
I'm gonna go straight up.

776
00:30:13,000 --> 00:30:14,000
It's my fault.

777
00:30:14,000 --> 00:30:15,000
No.

778
00:30:15,000 --> 00:30:16,000
Yes.

779
00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:23,000
I'm trying, Piro, but I'm not having a great luck right now.

780
00:30:23,000 --> 00:30:26,000
Oh my god.

781
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:29,000
What is going on with the avatars?

782
00:30:29,000 --> 00:30:32,000
What the hell is going on?

783
00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:35,000
Why is everybody like a pony?

784
00:30:35,000 --> 00:30:36,000
Wait, what?

785
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:38,000
Hold down tab for a second here.

786
00:30:38,000 --> 00:30:39,000
Yeah.

787
00:30:39,000 --> 00:30:43,000
Is every single avatar a pony for you?

788
00:30:43,000 --> 00:30:44,000
No.

789
00:30:44,000 --> 00:30:46,000
I can keep mine in yours.

790
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:47,000
Why?

791
00:30:47,000 --> 00:30:48,000
What?

792
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:50,000
That's all I can see.

793
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:52,000
Well, that's a...

794
00:30:52,000 --> 00:30:54,000
I have no idea.

795
00:30:55,000 --> 00:30:56,000
Oh my god.

796
00:30:56,000 --> 00:30:58,000
Everyone else in the street can see yours though.

797
00:30:58,000 --> 00:30:59,000
I guess that's good.

798
00:30:59,000 --> 00:31:02,000
Man, no one has pushed our cart past the like spawn area here.

799
00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:05,000
I cannot even hit this person.

800
00:31:05,000 --> 00:31:07,000
There we go.

801
00:31:07,000 --> 00:31:09,000
We are getting absolutely dominated.

802
00:31:09,000 --> 00:31:11,000
They are already going up the track.

803
00:31:11,000 --> 00:31:13,000
Where is this pyrrole?

804
00:31:13,000 --> 00:31:16,000
Oh my god, I'm doing so awful.

805
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:18,000
Oh my goodness.

806
00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:19,000
No.

807
00:31:19,000 --> 00:31:20,000
Medic stay alive.

808
00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:21,000
Stay alive.

809
00:31:21,000 --> 00:31:23,000
Well,

810
00:31:23,000 --> 00:31:25,000
Medic.

811
00:31:25,000 --> 00:31:27,000
Alright, let's get on this cart.

812
00:31:27,000 --> 00:31:29,000
Let's do this.

813
00:31:29,000 --> 00:31:32,000
Alright, for some reason no one ever wants to go heavy.

814
00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:35,000
I guess we'll get back stabbed all the time.

815
00:31:35,000 --> 00:31:38,000
Does that cart really all the way over there?

816
00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:40,000
Oh my god.

817
00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:42,000
Come on, come at me.

818
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:45,000
Do you have the cart all the way at that last point?

819
00:31:45,000 --> 00:31:47,000
Are you kidding me?

820
00:31:47,000 --> 00:31:50,000
Holy crap.

821
00:31:50,000 --> 00:31:52,000
Yeah, that was kind of what I was thinking.

822
00:31:52,000 --> 00:31:56,000
How the hell did they get that there?

823
00:31:56,000 --> 00:31:58,000
How the hell did they get there?

824
00:31:58,000 --> 00:32:00,000
Oh, I'm hearing my scream.

825
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:02,000
Oh, I have to turn this off.

826
00:32:02,000 --> 00:32:04,000
Whoops.

827
00:32:04,000 --> 00:32:06,000
Yeah, that's, wow.

828
00:32:06,000 --> 00:32:07,000
Blue team.

829
00:32:07,000 --> 00:32:08,000
Bravo.

830
00:32:08,000 --> 00:32:10,000
My god.

831
00:32:10,000 --> 00:32:12,000
Look at this insanity going on here.

832
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:14,000
What is?

833
00:32:14,000 --> 00:32:15,000
Wow.

834
00:32:15,000 --> 00:32:17,000
There was a spy idling in a corner.

835
00:32:17,000 --> 00:32:21,000
And we were sitting there pummeling him for about 10 seconds.

836
00:32:21,000 --> 00:32:25,000
They're going to must have two scouts on the cart.

837
00:32:25,000 --> 00:32:26,000
Get them.

838
00:32:26,000 --> 00:32:27,000
Get them.

839
00:32:27,000 --> 00:32:29,000
Oh, come on.

840
00:32:29,000 --> 00:32:30,000
That's it.

841
00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:31,000
We lost.

842
00:32:31,000 --> 00:32:34,000
That is game over right there.

843
00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:35,000
I can't.

844
00:32:35,000 --> 00:32:36,000
I can't get them.

845
00:32:36,000 --> 00:32:37,000
Oh, no.

846
00:32:37,000 --> 00:32:38,000
Nope.

847
00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:39,000
That's not game over.

848
00:32:39,000 --> 00:32:40,000
What do I do?

849
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:41,000
What do I do?

850
00:32:41,000 --> 00:32:42,000
What do I do?

851
00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:44,000
What do I do?

852
00:32:44,000 --> 00:32:46,000
Let's push the car people.

853
00:32:46,000 --> 00:32:47,000
Get on that, god.

854
00:32:47,000 --> 00:32:48,000
Get on that, god.

855
00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:49,000
All right.

856
00:32:49,000 --> 00:32:55,000
I am as paranoid as you could possibly be right now.

857
00:32:55,000 --> 00:32:57,000
And you know what?

858
00:32:57,000 --> 00:33:02,000
I was literally turning around to check first by behind me and he got me.

859
00:33:02,000 --> 00:33:06,000
Like, my brain was telling my mouse to do that.

860
00:33:06,000 --> 00:33:08,000
And like, I got back.

861
00:33:08,000 --> 00:33:10,000
That's why I went pyro.

862
00:33:10,000 --> 00:33:12,000
I'm just like spraying everywhere.

863
00:33:12,000 --> 00:33:15,000
I was just watching you do that.

864
00:33:15,000 --> 00:33:17,000
All right.

865
00:33:17,000 --> 00:33:18,000
Paranoid.

866
00:33:18,000 --> 00:33:24,000
What's up, guys?

867
00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:25,000
You know, I'm standing up with you.

868
00:33:25,000 --> 00:33:26,000
And again, with the spy.

869
00:33:26,000 --> 00:33:31,000
Even though I'm a pyro, I've got back to have again.

870
00:33:31,000 --> 00:33:32,000
Oh, my god.

871
00:33:32,000 --> 00:33:36,000
People are just everywhere.

872
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:39,000
I love their message.

873
00:33:39,000 --> 00:33:40,000
They're going to get it.

874
00:33:40,000 --> 00:33:42,000
They're going to get it.

875
00:33:42,000 --> 00:33:43,000
All right.

876
00:33:43,000 --> 00:33:44,000
I'm playing that right now.

877
00:33:44,000 --> 00:33:45,000
You're playing as a heavy.

878
00:33:45,000 --> 00:33:46,000
Heavy.

879
00:33:46,000 --> 00:33:47,000
Oh, where are we?

880
00:33:47,000 --> 00:33:48,000
Six shot.

881
00:33:48,000 --> 00:33:49,000
Six shot.

882
00:33:49,000 --> 00:33:51,000
Wherever that was.

883
00:33:51,000 --> 00:33:55,000
That got that scout off.

884
00:33:55,000 --> 00:33:56,000
German.

885
00:33:56,000 --> 00:33:57,000
Do you love me?

886
00:33:57,000 --> 00:33:58,000
Do you love me?

887
00:33:58,000 --> 00:33:59,000
Do you love me?

888
00:33:59,000 --> 00:34:01,000
Do you love me?

889
00:34:01,000 --> 00:34:02,000
Do you love me?

890
00:34:02,000 --> 00:34:05,000
Now that I can't dance.

891
00:34:05,000 --> 00:34:08,000
That's a song, right?

892
00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:09,000
Yeah.

893
00:34:09,000 --> 00:34:12,000
I would sing it in the shower.

894
00:34:12,000 --> 00:34:14,000
Let's do it.

895
00:34:14,000 --> 00:34:18,000
I'm not going to do the uncrading tonight.

896
00:34:18,000 --> 00:34:20,000
I'm going to be doing.

897
00:34:20,000 --> 00:34:23,000
That's going to be in a live calm, just a straight-up video.

898
00:34:23,000 --> 00:34:25,000
Probably next week.

899
00:34:25,000 --> 00:34:26,000
You.

900
00:34:26,000 --> 00:34:27,000
Get out of here.

901
00:34:27,000 --> 00:34:28,000
You're not dead.

902
00:34:28,000 --> 00:34:29,000
I know you're not dead.

903
00:34:29,000 --> 00:34:30,000
I'm jumping away.

904
00:34:30,000 --> 00:34:31,000
Yeah.

905
00:34:31,000 --> 00:34:33,000
Get away from me.

906
00:34:33,000 --> 00:34:35,000
I need help.

907
00:34:35,000 --> 00:34:37,000
Oh, do I get help?

908
00:34:37,000 --> 00:34:40,000
Or do I spy-check everybody in my team?

909
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:42,000
Whatever works.

910
00:34:42,000 --> 00:34:44,000
I see you up here, spy.

911
00:34:44,000 --> 00:34:45,000
You little sniper.

912
00:34:45,000 --> 00:34:47,000
You crazy little sniper.

913
00:34:47,000 --> 00:34:48,000
Yep.

914
00:34:48,000 --> 00:34:50,000
Nice try on your stair step, but it didn't work.

915
00:34:50,000 --> 00:34:51,000
Did it?

916
00:34:51,000 --> 00:34:52,000
No, that was not spy.

917
00:34:52,000 --> 00:34:53,000
That got-

918
00:34:53,000 --> 00:34:54,000
Oh, God.

919
00:34:54,000 --> 00:34:58,000
Where's the other guy?

920
00:34:58,000 --> 00:35:02,000
Oh, my God.

921
00:35:02,000 --> 00:35:03,000
Oh, my God.

922
00:35:03,000 --> 00:35:06,000
Where is the other guy?

923
00:35:06,000 --> 00:35:07,000
No more heavy.

924
00:35:07,000 --> 00:35:10,000
I'm going to go heavy.

925
00:35:10,000 --> 00:35:13,000
I'm staying heavy.

926
00:35:13,000 --> 00:35:14,000
Up there all on the-

927
00:35:14,000 --> 00:35:15,000
They're all on the carto-

928
00:35:15,000 --> 00:35:18,000
Oh, this is me, Robo.

929
00:35:18,000 --> 00:35:19,000
Oh, my God.

930
00:35:19,000 --> 00:35:20,000
Did that pyro?

931
00:35:20,000 --> 00:35:22,000
I just went to a side pyro on them.

932
00:35:22,000 --> 00:35:23,000
I got at least one, I think.

933
00:35:23,000 --> 00:35:25,000
I got to eat this so I can run fast.

934
00:35:25,000 --> 00:35:26,000
Oh, they're going.

935
00:35:26,000 --> 00:35:27,000
They're almost there.

936
00:35:27,000 --> 00:35:28,000
They're going to get it.

937
00:35:28,000 --> 00:35:30,000
So that means I can run away, because I just took this-

938
00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:32,000
There's three people on it?

939
00:35:32,000 --> 00:35:33,000
Oh, they're definitely going to get it.

940
00:35:33,000 --> 00:35:34,000
Yeah.

941
00:35:34,000 --> 00:35:36,000
See how fast I'm running?

942
00:35:36,000 --> 00:35:41,000
You won't get the satisfaction of killing me.

943
00:35:41,000 --> 00:35:43,000
Actually, he kind of did.

944
00:35:43,000 --> 00:35:46,000
He kind of did get the satisfaction of killing me.

945
00:35:46,000 --> 00:35:49,000
Too late.

946
00:35:49,000 --> 00:35:51,000
I am good.

947
00:35:51,000 --> 00:35:52,000
No, I have to-

948
00:35:52,000 --> 00:35:54,000
Oh, do I go medic?

949
00:35:54,000 --> 00:35:56,000
I'm going to wreck sniper.

950
00:35:56,000 --> 00:35:58,000
I'm still too paranoid, man.

951
00:35:58,000 --> 00:35:59,000
I'm just like-

952
00:35:59,000 --> 00:36:02,000
I'm spraying inside the spawn area.

953
00:36:02,000 --> 00:36:05,000
That's how paranoid I am.

954
00:36:05,000 --> 00:36:09,000
Now that's paranoid for you.

955
00:36:09,000 --> 00:36:11,000
Oh, they all blew up.

956
00:36:11,000 --> 00:36:12,000
You are RS5.

957
00:36:12,000 --> 00:36:13,000
No, you're not.

958
00:36:13,000 --> 00:36:16,000
Apparently I am dueling.

959
00:36:16,000 --> 00:36:20,000
Bum, bum, bum, bum, bum, bum, bum, bum, bum.

960
00:36:20,000 --> 00:36:22,000
Damn.

961
00:36:22,000 --> 00:36:25,000
Oh, what?

962
00:36:25,000 --> 00:36:27,000
I don't even know what just happened.

963
00:36:27,000 --> 00:36:29,000
I was like checking around too.

964
00:36:29,000 --> 00:36:30,000
I'm going medic.

965
00:36:30,000 --> 00:36:34,000
It's the best thing to do right now.

966
00:36:34,000 --> 00:36:38,000
Ow, ow, ow, ow, ow.

967
00:36:38,000 --> 00:36:41,000
Spy?

968
00:36:41,000 --> 00:36:44,000
I'm just going to go kill bot medic.

969
00:36:44,000 --> 00:36:46,000
And I can make sure everyone stays alive.

970
00:36:46,000 --> 00:36:49,000
I'm going to have my back turn the entire time.

971
00:36:49,000 --> 00:36:51,000
Do it, man.

972
00:36:51,000 --> 00:36:53,000
The entire time.

973
00:36:53,000 --> 00:36:55,000
We have like-

974
00:36:55,000 --> 00:36:57,000
Oh, we have two pirates on the team right now.

975
00:36:57,000 --> 00:36:58,000
We have like three earlier.

976
00:36:58,000 --> 00:37:00,000
People were just so paranoid.

977
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:03,000
Oh, you get caught up here.

978
00:37:03,000 --> 00:37:05,000
Oh, god.

979
00:37:05,000 --> 00:37:07,000
And there's another spy.

980
00:37:07,000 --> 00:37:09,000
God, run away.

981
00:37:09,000 --> 00:37:11,000
Help me. Somebody help me.

982
00:37:11,000 --> 00:37:12,000
Stay safe.

983
00:37:12,000 --> 00:37:14,000
Stay close to the blue red.

984
00:37:14,000 --> 00:37:16,000
I can't live it and hit him.

985
00:37:16,000 --> 00:37:17,000
Oh, he's going to kill me.

986
00:37:17,000 --> 00:37:18,000
Oh, my god.

987
00:37:18,000 --> 00:37:20,000
I'm a lucky son of a bitch.

988
00:37:20,000 --> 00:37:21,000
I'm-

989
00:37:21,000 --> 00:37:22,000
I got to run away.

990
00:37:22,000 --> 00:37:23,000
I am on.

991
00:37:23,000 --> 00:37:24,000
What do you say?

992
00:37:24,000 --> 00:37:25,000
What do you say?

993
00:37:25,000 --> 00:37:26,000
Oh, shit.

994
00:37:26,000 --> 00:37:27,000
I didn't want to do that.

995
00:37:27,000 --> 00:37:28,000
Oh, god.

996
00:37:28,000 --> 00:37:31,000
I just like traded with somebody.

997
00:37:31,000 --> 00:37:34,000
Dude, no one is pushing our cart, including myself.

998
00:37:34,000 --> 00:37:35,000
Oh, I'm going to love a god.

999
00:37:35,000 --> 00:37:38,000
It's still like right there.

1000
00:37:38,000 --> 00:37:41,000
He's still right there.

1001
00:37:41,000 --> 00:37:43,000
Right there, it's fun, man.

1002
00:37:43,000 --> 00:37:47,000
Actually, to be quite honest with you, that was the most success I've had all game.

1003
00:37:47,000 --> 00:37:49,000
It's with that medic.

1004
00:37:49,000 --> 00:37:54,000
And I healed like two people.

1005
00:37:54,000 --> 00:37:57,000
Medic.

1006
00:37:57,000 --> 00:38:00,000
All right, I'll get another medic.

1007
00:38:01,000 --> 00:38:03,000
Medic.

1008
00:38:03,000 --> 00:38:06,000
Ah!

1009
00:38:06,000 --> 00:38:09,000
Ah, still a side medic.

1010
00:38:09,000 --> 00:38:12,000
Oh, this guy is toast.

1011
00:38:12,000 --> 00:38:14,000
Oh, what would be the guy behind me?

1012
00:38:14,000 --> 00:38:15,000
Switch.

1013
00:38:15,000 --> 00:38:19,000
Oh, you'll see how much spies are on their team.

1014
00:38:19,000 --> 00:38:20,000
Just account.

1015
00:38:20,000 --> 00:38:22,000
It's got to be at least three.

1016
00:38:22,000 --> 00:38:23,000
It's got to be.

1017
00:38:23,000 --> 00:38:27,000
If it's not, then I'm wrong.

1018
00:38:27,000 --> 00:38:28,000
I need to do it.

1019
00:38:28,000 --> 00:38:31,000
I need to take up the grid screen.

1020
00:38:31,000 --> 00:38:32,000
Quick fix.

1021
00:38:32,000 --> 00:38:35,000
Quick fix.

1022
00:38:35,000 --> 00:38:39,000
No trades.

1023
00:38:39,000 --> 00:38:41,000
I don't take the trades right now.

1024
00:38:41,000 --> 00:38:42,000
That was a terrible scar.

1025
00:38:42,000 --> 00:38:44,000
That was supposed to be a Scottish accent, guys.

1026
00:38:44,000 --> 00:38:47,000
How terrible was that?

1027
00:38:47,000 --> 00:38:48,000
That's a spy.

1028
00:38:48,000 --> 00:38:50,000
I am certain of this.

1029
00:38:50,000 --> 00:38:52,000
No, I guess I'm wrong.

1030
00:38:52,000 --> 00:38:54,000
Oh, barely got me.

1031
00:38:54,000 --> 00:38:57,000
And I'm like getting people killed because I'm checking for this fucker.

1032
00:38:58,000 --> 00:39:01,000
Did I just heal this fight?

1033
00:39:01,000 --> 00:39:02,000
No, I didn't.

1034
00:39:02,000 --> 00:39:03,000
No way.

1035
00:39:03,000 --> 00:39:06,000
Dude, we've got four pyros on our team now.

1036
00:39:06,000 --> 00:39:09,000
The people they are listening, they're like,

1037
00:39:09,000 --> 00:39:11,000
enough of this nonsense.

1038
00:39:11,000 --> 00:39:13,000
We have like getting shot from.

1039
00:39:13,000 --> 00:39:15,000
I don't even know where they're coming from.

1040
00:39:15,000 --> 00:39:20,000
It's almost like they're coming out of our spawn.

1041
00:39:20,000 --> 00:39:22,000
I'm going pyro on easy mode right here.

1042
00:39:22,000 --> 00:39:25,000
I've got like the back burner, so I don't even have to think.

1043
00:39:25,000 --> 00:39:28,000
I'm just like, spray.

1044
00:39:28,000 --> 00:39:33,000
I'm trying to use the, uh, the quick fix.

1045
00:39:33,000 --> 00:39:34,000
You know, I'm going to heal you.

1046
00:39:34,000 --> 00:39:36,000
We're just going to run like the dickens.

1047
00:39:36,000 --> 00:39:38,000
Uh-oh, run away.

1048
00:39:38,000 --> 00:39:40,000
Look at all the, what?

1049
00:39:40,000 --> 00:39:43,000
Those are all spies.

1050
00:39:43,000 --> 00:39:47,000
At least, oh my god, this is the worst thing ever.

1051
00:39:47,000 --> 00:39:50,000
Oh my god, chaos.

1052
00:39:50,000 --> 00:39:52,000
Run.

1053
00:39:52,000 --> 00:39:54,000
Oh my god.

1054
00:39:54,000 --> 00:39:57,000
Dude, you run against like the same heavy.

1055
00:39:57,000 --> 00:40:00,000
I'm put, I got a, I'm playing spy.

1056
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:04,000
We are trapped in this spawn area right now.

1057
00:40:04,000 --> 00:40:06,000
Where are you coming out from?

1058
00:40:06,000 --> 00:40:07,000
Left, right or center?

1059
00:40:07,000 --> 00:40:12,000
I keep going out because I'm a medic, so I'm trying to go out of the middle.

1060
00:40:12,000 --> 00:40:17,000
God, somebody just killed me so I can just get a back stab and feel good about myself.

1061
00:40:17,000 --> 00:40:18,000
Look at this.

1062
00:40:18,000 --> 00:40:19,000
Look at this K-Goth.

1063
00:40:19,000 --> 00:40:20,000
You got to be S.

1064
00:40:20,000 --> 00:40:21,000
I can't even say it.

1065
00:40:21,000 --> 00:40:23,000
I'm so upset.

1066
00:40:24,000 --> 00:40:29,000
Alright, let's make, let's make some statues.

1067
00:40:29,000 --> 00:40:32,000
Oh my god, I'm on like your team.

1068
00:40:32,000 --> 00:40:35,000
Oh great, now he knows I'm a spy.

1069
00:40:38,000 --> 00:40:39,000
Oh jeez.

1070
00:40:39,000 --> 00:40:43,000
Oh my god, I'm, I'm, I can't get out of spawn either, man.

1071
00:40:43,000 --> 00:40:48,000
This is using the Infos or the kill people.

1072
00:40:49,000 --> 00:40:55,000
As soon as I said there were four pyros, everyone switched back on our team.

1073
00:40:55,000 --> 00:41:01,000
Look at all those, oh man, I got blasted right there.

1074
00:41:01,000 --> 00:41:06,000
Alright, after this we're going to another server.

1075
00:41:06,000 --> 00:41:11,000
Because we need to scramble these teams.

1076
00:41:11,000 --> 00:41:16,000
They've got a Century gun right next to our cart.

1077
00:41:17,000 --> 00:41:18,000
Really?

1078
00:41:18,000 --> 00:41:21,000
That's not cool.

1079
00:41:21,000 --> 00:41:24,000
Hey, you know what's the note I got?

1080
00:41:24,000 --> 00:41:26,000
What do you have?

1081
00:41:26,000 --> 00:41:27,000
What you got?

1082
00:41:27,000 --> 00:41:29,000
No.

1083
00:41:29,000 --> 00:41:31,000
And they're already winning again.

1084
00:41:31,000 --> 00:41:36,000
Oh god, no, no please no.

1085
00:41:36,000 --> 00:41:41,000
All these ponies.

1086
00:41:41,000 --> 00:41:44,000
You know what, when all else fails, you just go.

1087
00:41:44,000 --> 00:41:48,000
What do you choose at least two people idling?

1088
00:41:48,000 --> 00:41:53,000
Well, at least when all else fails, you go straight up them on night.

1089
00:41:53,000 --> 00:41:56,000
And if that don't work, I just speaking of the good night.

1090
00:41:56,000 --> 00:41:58,000
More gone.

1091
00:41:58,000 --> 00:42:01,000
That's what I just went.

1092
00:42:01,000 --> 00:42:05,000
Oh my god, I'm just doing good.

1093
00:42:05,000 --> 00:42:12,000
I just charged out of spawn and I flew like 5,000 people.

1094
00:42:12,000 --> 00:42:17,000
Come on, last, get them, get them, get them, get them up to you.

1095
00:42:17,000 --> 00:42:18,000
And he did it.

1096
00:42:18,000 --> 00:42:22,000
He's a champion.

1097
00:42:22,000 --> 00:42:26,000
Alright, this is going to be a spire right here.

1098
00:42:26,000 --> 00:42:30,000
Get out of town.

1099
00:42:30,000 --> 00:42:33,000
I got one of the spots.

1100
00:42:33,000 --> 00:42:35,000
Oh my god, no.

1101
00:42:35,000 --> 00:42:39,000
Server change.

1102
00:42:39,000 --> 00:42:44,000
It's time to change service.

1103
00:42:44,000 --> 00:42:48,000
Let's go to, I want to go two weeks.

1104
00:42:48,000 --> 00:42:51,000
A server we can win on.

1105
00:42:51,000 --> 00:42:53,000
Well, I'm just kidding.

1106
00:42:53,000 --> 00:42:56,000
I want to go to my server.

1107
00:42:56,000 --> 00:42:59,000
I want to go to a board rush.

1108
00:42:59,000 --> 00:43:02,000
Are you ready?

1109
00:43:02,000 --> 00:43:04,000
Yes.

1110
00:43:04,000 --> 00:43:07,000
So, what's going on here?

1111
00:43:07,000 --> 00:43:10,000
It's going to be on my server.

1112
00:43:10,000 --> 00:43:14,000
1, 4, 6,

1113
00:43:14,000 --> 00:43:17,000
1, 4, 6,

1114
00:43:17,000 --> 00:43:19,000
1, 8.

1115
00:43:19,000 --> 00:43:21,000
Call on 2, 7, 0, 1, 5.

1116
00:43:21,000 --> 00:43:23,000
Go!

1117
00:43:23,000 --> 00:43:27,000
You almost lost me on the colon, but I think I got it.

1118
00:43:27,000 --> 00:43:31,000
Goal then, 2, 7, 0, 1, 5.

1119
00:43:31,000 --> 00:43:34,000
1, 2, 7, 0, 5, 7.

1120
00:43:34,000 --> 00:43:36,000
to

1121
00:43:36,000 --> 00:43:38,000
the

1122
00:43:38,000 --> 00:43:40,000
the

1123
00:43:40,000 --> 00:43:42,000
the

1124
00:43:42,000 --> 00:43:44,000
the

1125
00:43:44,000 --> 00:43:46,000
the

1126
00:43:46,000 --> 00:43:48,000
the

1127
00:43:48,000 --> 00:43:50,000
the

1128
00:43:50,000 --> 00:43:52,000
the

1129
00:43:52,000 --> 00:43:54,000
the

1130
00:43:54,000 --> 00:43:56,000
the

1131
00:43:56,000 --> 00:43:58,000
the

1132
00:43:58,000 --> 00:44:00,000
the

1133
00:44:00,000 --> 00:44:02,000
the

1134
00:44:02,000 --> 00:44:04,000
the

1135
00:44:04,000 --> 00:44:05,000
the

1136
00:44:05,000 --> 00:44:06,000
the

1137
00:44:06,000 --> 00:44:08,000
the

1138
00:44:08,000 --> 00:44:10,000
the

1139
00:44:10,000 --> 00:44:14,000
the

1140
00:44:14,000 --> 00:44:18,000
allows

1141
00:44:18,000 --> 00:44:20,000
to

1142
00:44:20,000 --> 00:44:21,000
the

1143
00:44:21,000 --> 00:44:23,000
the

1144
00:44:23,000 --> 00:44:26,000
the

1145
00:44:26,000 --> 00:44:30,000
the

1146
00:44:30,000 --> 00:44:33,000
Yeah, but still.

1147
00:44:33,000 --> 00:44:37,000
There's somebody out there with this ridiculous internet speeds.

1148
00:44:37,000 --> 00:44:41,000
Yeah, and I can just, I can just come right in.

1149
00:44:41,000 --> 00:44:43,000
Pipeline payload.

1150
00:44:43,000 --> 00:44:46,000
Yes, Strangeloves, that this is a talix plane.

1151
00:44:46,000 --> 00:44:47,000
You are correct.

1152
00:44:47,000 --> 00:44:51,000
Hey guys, hey Strangeloves, how's it going?

1153
00:44:51,000 --> 00:44:53,000
So this is the server?

1154
00:44:53,000 --> 00:44:56,000
Wait, did that, what? Wait, hold on a second.

1155
00:44:56,000 --> 00:44:58,000
Did that already fill up?

1156
00:44:58,000 --> 00:45:00,000
We already full.

1157
00:45:00,000 --> 00:45:01,000
I didn't, oh, somebody else put it in.

1158
00:45:01,000 --> 00:45:03,000
Okay, thank you to whoever put that in.

1159
00:45:03,000 --> 00:45:05,000
Thank you. I appreciate it.

1160
00:45:05,000 --> 00:45:06,000
I thought you didn't join.

1161
00:45:06,000 --> 00:45:09,000
That's what I thought at first.

1162
00:45:09,000 --> 00:45:14,000
Oh God, this is like a jellyfish server.

1163
00:45:14,000 --> 00:45:15,000
What?

1164
00:45:15,000 --> 00:45:20,000
Like the screen is motor like a jellyfish for me right now.

1165
00:45:20,000 --> 00:45:22,000
Look at how laggy everybody is.

1166
00:45:22,000 --> 00:45:23,000
Look at this.

1167
00:45:23,000 --> 00:45:27,000
I feel like it's like, oh my god, look at this claymation server.

1168
00:45:28,000 --> 00:45:29,000
Look at that.

1169
00:45:29,000 --> 00:45:30,000
Hey, let me see.

1170
00:45:30,000 --> 00:45:34,000
Well, oh, look at that pings.

1171
00:45:34,000 --> 00:45:36,000
My goodness gracious.

1172
00:45:36,000 --> 00:45:39,000
Everyone except for me and you is like 100 plus.

1173
00:45:39,000 --> 00:45:42,000
It really looks like a stop motion animation.

1174
00:45:42,000 --> 00:45:44,000
Like, video.

1175
00:45:44,000 --> 00:45:46,000
I feel like.

1176
00:45:46,000 --> 00:45:50,000
I feel like I'm playing at 20 frames per second.

1177
00:45:50,000 --> 00:45:52,000
But I'm not.

1178
00:45:52,000 --> 00:45:53,000
But I'm not.

1179
00:45:53,000 --> 00:45:55,000
Oh, I'm sorry guys.

1180
00:45:55,000 --> 00:45:58,000
Look, we got to change again because this is just bad.

1181
00:45:58,000 --> 00:46:01,000
All right, this is not this is not against the people who are here.

1182
00:46:01,000 --> 00:46:04,000
This is one of the people who didn't get in.

1183
00:46:04,000 --> 00:46:05,000
Yeah, it's right.

1184
00:46:05,000 --> 00:46:08,000
It tells you you can look at the stream and see what I see right now.

1185
00:46:08,000 --> 00:46:09,000
It is like.

1186
00:46:09,000 --> 00:46:13,000
It is pretty much like I'm watching a cartoon on drugs.

1187
00:46:18,000 --> 00:46:21,000
All right, well, yeah, looks like nobody could even get into this one.

1188
00:46:21,000 --> 00:46:24,000
There was only seven on eight.

1189
00:46:25,000 --> 00:46:26,000
I apologize.

1190
00:46:26,000 --> 00:46:27,000
I sorry.

1191
00:46:27,000 --> 00:46:29,000
New server.

1192
00:46:29,000 --> 00:46:31,000
Take three.

1193
00:46:31,000 --> 00:46:33,000
Yeah, third time's a charm.

1194
00:46:33,000 --> 00:46:34,000
Third time.

1195
00:46:34,000 --> 00:46:35,000
How one?

1196
00:46:35,000 --> 00:46:36,000
Two.

1197
00:46:36,000 --> 00:46:37,000
Three.

1198
00:46:37,000 --> 00:46:38,000
Crunch.

1199
00:46:38,000 --> 00:46:40,000
So wait till I get my third time.

1200
00:46:40,000 --> 00:46:42,000
I'm probably going to go 32 person server.

1201
00:46:42,000 --> 00:46:43,000
I'm going to hope I can.

1202
00:46:43,000 --> 00:46:45,000
But wait till I get that server.

1203
00:46:45,000 --> 00:46:47,000
We'll be okay.

1204
00:46:47,000 --> 00:46:50,000
I want to server all the cool kids have one.

1205
00:46:50,000 --> 00:46:52,000
All right, here we go.

1206
00:46:52,000 --> 00:46:57,000
66.55.154.

1207
00:46:57,000 --> 00:46:59,000
Don't two, three, four.

1208
00:46:59,000 --> 00:47:02,000
Call in 27015.

1209
00:47:02,000 --> 00:47:03,000
And we paste this in.

1210
00:47:03,000 --> 00:47:05,000
And a second once we get in.

1211
00:47:05,000 --> 00:47:08,000
I do apologize that we have to do this twice.

1212
00:47:08,000 --> 00:47:09,000
That was the third time.

1213
00:47:09,000 --> 00:47:11,000
Hopefully this one is going to be the good one.

1214
00:47:11,000 --> 00:47:13,000
They pasted it in already.

1215
00:47:13,000 --> 00:47:15,000
Did it really?

1216
00:47:15,000 --> 00:47:18,000
It told you it was like literally two seconds after you said it.

1217
00:47:18,000 --> 00:47:19,000
I saw it pop up in the chat.

1218
00:47:19,000 --> 00:47:21,000
You guys are fast.

1219
00:47:22,000 --> 00:47:24,000
Lighting fast, even.

1220
00:47:24,000 --> 00:47:25,000
You might say.

1221
00:47:25,000 --> 00:47:27,000
You can say that.

1222
00:47:27,000 --> 00:47:30,000
Bam.

1223
00:47:30,000 --> 00:47:35,000
Oh, oh.

1224
00:47:35,000 --> 00:47:40,000
I am going demo night.

1225
00:47:40,000 --> 00:47:42,000
I actually found.

1226
00:47:42,000 --> 00:47:43,000
Oh, sorry.

1227
00:47:43,000 --> 00:47:44,000
What?

1228
00:47:44,000 --> 00:47:45,000
I said demo.

1229
00:47:45,000 --> 00:47:47,000
I was just re-language.

1230
00:47:47,000 --> 00:47:50,000
I actually found a salt and ceremonial the other day.

1231
00:47:50,000 --> 00:47:51,000
Oh.

1232
00:47:51,000 --> 00:47:53,000
I was very happy about that.

1233
00:47:53,000 --> 00:47:54,000
Very cool.

1234
00:47:54,000 --> 00:47:59,000
So now I can have a legit demo night if I wanted to give up my grenade launcher.

1235
00:47:59,000 --> 00:48:02,000
It's a tough call for the booties.

1236
00:48:02,000 --> 00:48:03,000
Yeah.

1237
00:48:03,000 --> 00:48:04,000
Booties.

1238
00:48:04,000 --> 00:48:06,000
And then we got Stimidae here.

1239
00:48:06,000 --> 00:48:09,000
With this wicked sick hat.

1240
00:48:09,000 --> 00:48:18,000
So I have to do this right now.

1241
00:48:18,000 --> 00:48:23,000
Because somebody keeps sending me a very inappropriate message.

1242
00:48:23,000 --> 00:48:25,000
And hopefully that stops that from happening.

1243
00:48:25,000 --> 00:48:28,000
I don't think it will, but I at least tried.

1244
00:48:28,000 --> 00:48:29,000
Oh.

1245
00:48:29,000 --> 00:48:30,000
Okay.

1246
00:48:30,000 --> 00:48:32,000
All right.

1247
00:48:32,000 --> 00:48:34,000
We got a full serving now.

1248
00:48:34,000 --> 00:48:35,000
Good to go.

1249
00:48:35,000 --> 00:48:36,000
Come back.

1250
00:48:36,000 --> 00:48:37,000
Just in time.

1251
00:48:37,000 --> 00:48:39,000
But it's on the real way.

1252
00:48:39,000 --> 00:48:40,000
Like everyone.

1253
00:48:40,000 --> 00:48:43,000
Oh, so over at the same time.

1254
00:48:43,000 --> 00:48:44,000
Oh, my God.

1255
00:48:44,000 --> 00:48:45,000
You just totally predicted.

1256
00:48:45,000 --> 00:48:46,000
Where I was going to shoot.

1257
00:48:46,000 --> 00:48:47,000
Shotguns, soldier.

1258
00:48:47,000 --> 00:48:48,000
Shotguns, soldier.

1259
00:48:48,000 --> 00:48:49,000
Oh, my God.

1260
00:48:49,000 --> 00:48:51,000
Did you see that?

1261
00:48:51,000 --> 00:48:52,000
Yeah, yeah.

1262
00:48:52,000 --> 00:48:53,000
I've loved it one night.

1263
00:48:53,000 --> 00:48:56,000
Yeah, I've only so far given one third.

1264
00:48:56,000 --> 00:48:57,000
I'm still waiting on two people.

1265
00:48:57,000 --> 00:48:59,000
So eventually I will be giving 100%.

1266
00:48:59,000 --> 00:49:03,000
But I have to wait for the other two people to get back to me.

1267
00:49:03,000 --> 00:49:08,000
I'm going to get back to the other two people.

1268
00:49:08,000 --> 00:49:10,000
I'm going to get back to the other two people.

1269
00:49:10,000 --> 00:49:13,000
I'm going to get back to the other two people.

1270
00:49:13,000 --> 00:49:15,000
I'm going to get back to the other two people.

1271
00:49:15,000 --> 00:49:16,000
I'm going to get back to the other two people.

1272
00:49:16,000 --> 00:49:17,000
I'm going to get back to the other two people.

1273
00:49:17,000 --> 00:49:18,000
Oh, that hurt.

1274
00:49:18,000 --> 00:49:19,000
Oh, dear.

1275
00:49:19,000 --> 00:49:20,000
I made quite a mess.

1276
00:49:20,000 --> 00:49:23,000
Someone on the team was announcing how many spies they have.

1277
00:49:23,000 --> 00:49:25,000
They have four, apparently.

1278
00:49:25,000 --> 00:49:27,000
I want a good trader.

1279
00:49:27,000 --> 00:49:28,000
He is.

1280
00:49:28,000 --> 00:49:30,000
How ironic is that?

1281
00:49:30,000 --> 00:49:31,000
So he's a double spy.

1282
00:49:31,000 --> 00:49:33,000
Yeah, so he's telling us about spies.

1283
00:49:33,000 --> 00:49:38,000
So he's spying on the spies for his own spies.

1284
00:49:38,000 --> 00:49:40,000
As someone in the comments will end up in the comments.

1285
00:49:40,000 --> 00:49:41,000
He's spying on the spies.

1286
00:49:41,000 --> 00:49:42,000
Yeah, that is absolutely what it is.

1287
00:49:42,000 --> 00:49:51,000
Oh, no, Paul, this may be his wife.

1288
00:49:51,000 --> 00:49:55,000
Maybe he's a triple spy.

1289
00:49:55,000 --> 00:49:58,000
He said, I serve no one.

1290
00:49:58,000 --> 00:50:00,000
The CIA, don't trust anyone.

1291
00:50:00,000 --> 00:50:02,000
I like your attitude.

1292
00:50:02,000 --> 00:50:03,000
And that's his wife and he's stired.

1293
00:50:03,000 --> 00:50:04,000
He's going to get ugly.

1294
00:50:04,000 --> 00:50:05,000
He's going to try and stare stabbing.

1295
00:50:05,000 --> 00:50:06,000
I already know this.

1296
00:50:06,000 --> 00:50:07,000
I know this.

1297
00:50:07,000 --> 00:50:08,000
I know this.

1298
00:50:08,000 --> 00:50:09,000
I know this.

1299
00:50:09,000 --> 00:50:13,000
I already know this. I already know this. I've been around the block a few times.

1300
00:50:15,000 --> 00:50:20,000
You know what? You, oh no, I'm gonna stand right here. You're gonna have to go that way.

1301
00:50:22,000 --> 00:50:23,000
Oh god. Oh no.

1302
00:50:26,000 --> 00:50:28,000
Oh!

1303
00:50:39,000 --> 00:50:42,000
Let's see where...

1304
00:50:44,000 --> 00:50:48,000
On the oldened time. Oh, we got, we got the bluebird pyro going down here. Oh my god.

1305
00:50:52,000 --> 00:50:55,000
Well you just die your pyro. What am I doing?

1306
00:50:56,000 --> 00:51:01,000
Well they're almost there man. They're right at the edge with seven minutes and 40 seconds to go. We can do this.

1307
00:51:01,000 --> 00:51:03,000
Oh come on I would have had it. I would have had it.

1308
00:51:04,000 --> 00:51:10,000
I would have had it. I would have been sarcastic by the way. I had no faith.

1309
00:51:18,000 --> 00:51:20,000
I don't even know if that's how you spell it but that's what I'm doing.

1310
00:51:21,000 --> 00:51:28,000
I love how the highest score scoring player on our team is four points and was like a four-way tie for four.

1311
00:51:28,000 --> 00:51:31,000
Me included.

1312
00:51:32,000 --> 00:51:34,000
Yeah, yeah, four, four, four, four, four, three.

1313
00:51:38,000 --> 00:51:39,000
Boom!

1314
00:51:41,000 --> 00:51:44,000
I don't scramble in the teams. Well that's one way to do it.

1315
00:51:45,000 --> 00:51:50,000
Whoa! All right so this is, oh goodbye. Wait.

1316
00:51:52,000 --> 00:51:54,000
Are you changing your name? Yeah I did.

1317
00:51:55,000 --> 00:51:56,000
Did you guess who I am?

1318
00:51:56,000 --> 00:51:58,000
Well I...

1319
00:51:58,000 --> 00:52:01,000
Yeah it's not hard. Yes because I can see your icon.

1320
00:52:01,000 --> 00:52:03,000
Henderson in corporate.

1321
00:52:04,000 --> 00:52:09,000
We sell carpets and we do floor finishing.

1322
00:52:09,000 --> 00:52:13,000
Where do you come up with your name? You just look at something and say okay I'm gonna take that.

1323
00:52:13,000 --> 00:52:18,000
Kind of. It's just whatever is in my brain at that particular second is what it is.

1324
00:52:18,000 --> 00:52:19,000
Oh I tried to high five.

1325
00:52:20,000 --> 00:52:24,000
So this is gonna be the last round of TF2 and then I'm gonna move on to CS. Go for a little bit.

1326
00:52:25,000 --> 00:52:29,000
I gotta make a count then. Oh then you have it right?

1327
00:52:30,000 --> 00:52:32,000
I don't have CS go. Oh damn.

1328
00:52:33,000 --> 00:52:35,000
That's what I was saying. I'm gonna have to bow out when you switch games.

1329
00:52:37,000 --> 00:52:38,000
Let's go. I mean we've been playing for about an hour or something.

1330
00:52:39,000 --> 00:52:43,000
Still, still has it but he... Yeah he's... I mean if you need the eat I mean

1331
00:52:44,000 --> 00:52:47,000
he's eating macaroni and cheese and like dog food and whatever he eats.

1332
00:52:48,000 --> 00:52:50,000
Dude I don't... You're making me hungry man.

1333
00:52:51,000 --> 00:52:54,000
macaroni and cheese and dog food. Come on.

1334
00:52:54,000 --> 00:52:58,000
Oh that's delicacy. Watch out Uber. I don't think I'm right up the door.

1335
00:52:59,000 --> 00:53:02,000
Oh my god that guy just killed every single person in here.

1336
00:53:06,000 --> 00:53:08,000
So stealth must be watching the stream.

1337
00:53:11,000 --> 00:53:12,000
Why is he responding?

1338
00:53:12,000 --> 00:53:15,000
I don't know. Scrains left your cities here. He's in here.

1339
00:53:19,000 --> 00:53:21,000
Oh my god. He's eating cheese. Watch the nit at the tape.

1340
00:53:21,000 --> 00:53:24,000
It's his parents. Imagine he just has like his laptop out.

1341
00:53:27,000 --> 00:53:29,000
I should have done the buff banner. I really should have.

1342
00:53:30,000 --> 00:53:32,000
I gotta kill that medic.

1343
00:53:36,000 --> 00:53:37,000
Ah.

1344
00:53:40,000 --> 00:53:40,000
Oh man.

1345
00:53:43,000 --> 00:53:45,000
I can't talk about...

1346
00:53:45,000 --> 00:53:47,000
Oh that would have been cool if I had that go off.

1347
00:53:50,000 --> 00:53:52,000
Just get the teleport and the telecaribot.

1348
00:53:54,000 --> 00:53:56,000
You should be on the winning team now maybe.

1349
00:53:56,000 --> 00:53:58,000
Oh don't hit my medic you bastards.

1350
00:53:59,000 --> 00:54:01,000
I can't believe they haven't turned around.

1351
00:54:01,000 --> 00:54:04,000
How? I just did two crits and I'm hitting my own teammate.

1352
00:54:04,000 --> 00:54:06,000
What the hell is going on?

1353
00:54:07,000 --> 00:54:11,000
Dude I just planted like six hits into this guy.

1354
00:54:11,000 --> 00:54:12,000
Holy crap.

1355
00:54:13,000 --> 00:54:15,000
That was ridiculous. I've never seen that happen before.

1356
00:54:17,000 --> 00:54:19,000
Both hammering on the same guy.

1357
00:54:19,000 --> 00:54:19,000
Oh guys.

1358
00:54:20,000 --> 00:54:21,000
Are we got a crit screen now?

1359
00:54:21,000 --> 00:54:22,000
We got a crit screen now.

1360
00:54:22,000 --> 00:54:22,000
Oh man.

1361
00:54:26,000 --> 00:54:28,000
Oh there's four demo man.

1362
00:54:28,000 --> 00:54:29,000
I'm demo man.

1363
00:54:29,000 --> 00:54:30,000
I think no wonder.

1364
00:54:30,000 --> 00:54:32,000
I just like save that demo man's life.

1365
00:54:32,000 --> 00:54:33,000
But not really.

1366
00:54:34,000 --> 00:54:35,000
Alright push it push it.

1367
00:54:39,000 --> 00:54:40,000
Oh push it.

1368
00:54:41,000 --> 00:54:41,000
No.

1369
00:54:42,000 --> 00:54:43,000
No.

1370
00:54:45,000 --> 00:54:46,000
This is a really bad idea.

1371
00:54:46,000 --> 00:54:47,000
I just ran around and spawned.

1372
00:54:48,000 --> 00:54:49,000
Maybe not.

1373
00:54:49,000 --> 00:54:50,000
Come on.

1374
00:54:50,000 --> 00:54:50,000
Come on.

1375
00:54:51,000 --> 00:54:52,000
Oh come on.

1376
00:54:53,000 --> 00:54:53,000
No.

1377
00:54:55,000 --> 00:54:59,000
Oh that is a sad face indeed.

1378
00:55:00,000 --> 00:55:02,000
That is a sad face indeed.

1379
00:55:04,000 --> 00:55:06,000
Could have had an explosion kill.

1380
00:55:07,000 --> 00:55:08,000
Could have what a shudder.

1381
00:55:08,000 --> 00:55:09,000
What it didn't have.

1382
00:55:10,000 --> 00:55:11,000
I'm trying my hand.

1383
00:55:11,000 --> 00:55:13,000
Oh you guys are about to win.

1384
00:55:13,000 --> 00:55:16,000
You got like three pyros back here.

1385
00:55:16,000 --> 00:55:18,000
Just camping our spawn hard core.

1386
00:55:18,000 --> 00:55:18,000
Really?

1387
00:55:19,000 --> 00:55:20,000
Oh man never run.

1388
00:55:20,000 --> 00:55:20,000
Yeah.

1389
00:55:21,000 --> 00:55:21,000
Cool.

1390
00:55:23,000 --> 00:55:24,000
Let's do some crazy rocket jumps.

1391
00:55:26,000 --> 00:55:27,000
Here we come.

1392
00:55:27,000 --> 00:55:27,000
Rocket jump.

1393
00:55:27,000 --> 00:55:28,000
I think I got like one kill.

1394
00:55:29,000 --> 00:55:31,000
Dude I've been doing I've been doing jump maps.

1395
00:55:31,000 --> 00:55:31,000
See we go.

1396
00:55:35,000 --> 00:55:36,000
I did some jump maps.

1397
00:55:36,000 --> 00:55:37,000
I know what I'm doing.

1398
00:55:37,000 --> 00:55:38,000
Alright.

1399
00:55:38,000 --> 00:55:40,000
Somebody in the street said

1400
00:55:40,000 --> 00:55:42,000
germa plays play tribes of sinned.

1401
00:55:42,000 --> 00:55:43,000
That's what they said.

1402
00:55:43,000 --> 00:55:44,000
I'm not making that up.

1403
00:55:45,000 --> 00:55:47,000
Um I see I see people say that.

1404
00:55:47,000 --> 00:55:49,000
Um what

1405
00:55:49,000 --> 00:55:52,000
CSGO just had a big huge crazy update.

1406
00:55:52,000 --> 00:55:53,000
I want to check that out.

1407
00:55:53,000 --> 00:55:54,000
Five.

1408
00:55:54,000 --> 00:55:56,000
But to answer your questions in the comments

1409
00:55:56,000 --> 00:55:57,000
tribes of sin is free to play.

1410
00:55:57,000 --> 00:55:59,000
So it is.

1411
00:55:59,000 --> 00:56:01,000
And it's now totally open.

1412
00:56:01,000 --> 00:56:02,000
It's not in beta anymore.

1413
00:56:02,000 --> 00:56:02,000
It is out now.

1414
00:56:02,000 --> 00:56:04,000
Yeah it's out.

1415
00:56:04,000 --> 00:56:05,000
It's been released.

1416
00:56:05,000 --> 00:56:06,000
It is fun.

1417
00:56:06,000 --> 00:56:10,000
So that's uh I'm going to move on from TF2 now.

1418
00:56:10,000 --> 00:56:11,000
Played upon an hour of TF2.

1419
00:56:12,000 --> 00:56:14,000
So before I go I have to do something good.

1420
00:56:14,000 --> 00:56:15,000
I have to do something just stupid.

1421
00:56:15,000 --> 00:56:16,000
And just TF2.

1422
00:56:16,000 --> 00:56:17,000
Here we go.

1423
00:56:17,000 --> 00:56:18,000
Let's go uh place 5.

1424
00:56:19,000 --> 00:56:20,000
And I'm going to just.

1425
00:56:21,000 --> 00:56:22,000
This is this is the goal here guys.

1426
00:56:22,000 --> 00:56:27,000
The goal is to try and blend in with the other team.

1427
00:56:28,000 --> 00:56:31,000
So it's going to be hard to people are watching the stream.

1428
00:56:31,000 --> 00:56:32,000
But this could be interesting.

1429
00:56:32,000 --> 00:56:33,000
I want to try doing this at least once.

1430
00:56:33,000 --> 00:56:38,000
Why is there a floating scout stuff here?

1431
00:56:41,000 --> 00:56:42,000
Oh no I'm just the high five.

1432
00:56:43,000 --> 00:56:45,000
So the goal here is to try and blend in.

1433
00:56:45,000 --> 00:56:46,000
Let's see how well I do.

1434
00:56:50,000 --> 00:56:52,000
Let's see how well I do here.

1435
00:56:56,000 --> 00:56:57,000
All right we're going to stop them.

1436
00:56:59,000 --> 00:57:00,000
Come on get them.

1437
00:57:01,000 --> 00:57:05,000
Oh my god they're coming the car is upside down.

1438
00:57:05,000 --> 00:57:07,000
What the hell is going on with that car?

1439
00:57:07,000 --> 00:57:08,000
It is a thing.

1440
00:57:08,000 --> 00:57:09,000
Come on we must get them.

1441
00:57:10,000 --> 00:57:10,000
All right.

1442
00:57:11,000 --> 00:57:14,000
Oh no here they come they're coming out of the right door now.

1443
00:57:14,000 --> 00:57:14,000
Blue team.

1444

That's.

1445
00:57:15,000 --> 00:57:17,000
No I'm gonna oh you figure me out.

1446
00:57:22,000 --> 00:57:24,000
That guy no he didn't see me.

1447
00:57:24,000 --> 00:57:26,000
Okay I just got to build my stuff right here.

1448
00:57:27,000 --> 00:57:28,000
Just got to build some stuff.

1449
00:57:28,000 --> 00:57:30,000
I'm trying to build my uh my teleporter.

1450
00:57:30,000 --> 00:57:32,000
My century adds all good stuff.

1451
00:57:32,000 --> 00:57:34,000

1460
00:57:57,000 --> 00:57:59,000

Okay cool.

Uh sniper.

1465
00:58:06,000 --> 00:58:07,000
And there we go.

1466
00:58:07,000 --> 00:58:08,000
I'm gonna snipe.

1467
00:58:10,000 --> 00:58:11,000
All right let me get back to my sniping post.

1468
00:58:13,000 --> 00:58:14,000
All right here we go.

1469
00:58:16,000 --> 00:58:16,000
Just sniping.

1470
00:58:16,000 --> 00:58:18,000
Now the enemy team is coming out here.

1471
00:58:18,000 --> 00:58:18,000
Watch out guys.

1472
00:58:18,000 --> 00:58:19,000
Be careful.

1473
00:58:19,000 --> 00:58:20,000
Now let me snipe with you.

1474
00:58:23,000 --> 00:58:24,000
Oh god who's the real one?

1475
00:58:24,000 --> 00:58:26,000
We're standing right next to each other.

1476
00:58:26,000 --> 00:58:26,000
Oh you got me.

1477
00:58:27,000 --> 00:58:27,000
Shit.

1478
00:58:28,000 --> 00:58:31,000
Oh you ruined my fun.

1479
00:58:32,000 --> 00:58:33,000
That's what I get angry.

1480
00:58:34,000 --> 00:58:34,000
And die.

1481
00:58:38,000 --> 00:58:43,000
Oh all right that's uh that's gonna be actually out of run via the roundout.

1482
00:58:45,000 --> 00:58:46,000
I can't stop.

1483
00:58:46,000 --> 00:58:46,000
Why not?

1484
00:58:46,000 --> 00:58:48,000
It's disguised as an enemy sniper.

1485
00:58:48,000 --> 00:58:49,000
That's the best way to do it.

1486
00:58:50,000 --> 00:58:52,000
And then just sit in the corner and be like oh sniper.

1487
00:58:52,000 --> 00:58:59,000
Oh I was trying to get the three hits uh

1488
00:58:59,000 --> 00:59:01,000
crit with the gun slinger.

1489
00:59:01,000 --> 00:59:02,000
Almost got it.

1490
00:59:02,000 --> 00:59:04,000
Uh it's really satisfying.

1491
00:59:06,000 --> 00:59:07,000
Oh damn it.

1492
00:59:07,000 --> 00:59:09,000
Oh he didn't get me.

1493
00:59:09,000 --> 00:59:10,000
Uh huh uh huh.

1494
00:59:11,000 --> 00:59:13,000
Oh come on come on.

1495
00:59:13,000 --> 00:59:15,000
No no okay good good good.

1496
00:59:16,000 --> 00:59:17,000
All right let me get my sniping skills.

1497
00:59:19,000 --> 00:59:20,000
I found an ambassador.

1498
00:59:21,000 --> 00:59:23,000
I still don't have an unfortunate.

1499
00:59:23,000 --> 00:59:23,000
Really difficult.

1500
00:59:23,000 --> 00:59:24,000
Oh come on.

1501
00:59:27,000 --> 00:59:28,000
I'm just trying to snipe.

1502
00:59:30,000 --> 00:59:33,000
All right if you guys don't sub spam and chat about or blocking some people.

1503
00:59:34,000 --> 00:59:35,000
No they got it.

1504
00:59:35,000 --> 00:59:37,000
They found me out again.

1505
00:59:38,000 --> 00:59:40,000
Oh we get the wrath of the mod coming down.

1506
00:59:45,000 --> 00:59:45,000
Uh huh.

1507
00:59:48,000 --> 00:59:49,000
All right this is my last life.

1508
00:59:49,000 --> 00:59:52,000
Then I'm moving on to uh counter

1509
00:59:53,000 --> 00:59:53,000
Stephenson.

1510
00:59:54,000 --> 00:59:55,000
Great opportunity.

1511
00:59:58,000 --> 00:59:59,000
Backstab.

1512
01:00:00,000 --> 01:00:02,000
I'm gonna tell you how yeah I'm taking the teleporter as a spy.

1513
01:00:03,000 --> 01:00:05,000
At level two I'm a real bad bastard.

1514
01:00:05,000 --> 01:00:06,000
I'm a real bastard.

1515
01:00:06,000 --> 01:00:07,000
Look at this.

1516
01:00:07,000 --> 01:00:09,000
Level two teleporter and I'm taking it as a spy.

1517
01:00:09,000 --> 01:00:10,000
What a jerk.

1518
01:00:13,000 --> 01:00:16,000
I wonder if I can uh just kill people up from up here.

1519
01:00:17,000 --> 01:00:18,000
Oh for the love of god.

1520
01:00:19,000 --> 01:00:20,000
I just can't get the melee.

1521
01:00:23,000 --> 01:00:26,000
Oh well that's the last one.

1522
01:00:26,000 --> 01:00:27,000
Like the worst engineer ever.

1523
01:00:29,000 --> 01:00:31,000
How come I can't spray my spray?

1524
01:00:31,000 --> 01:00:32,000
That's not cool.

1525
01:00:34,000 --> 01:00:35,000
Yeah I don't have a spray.

1526
01:00:35,000 --> 01:00:36,000
I need to I need a cool one.

1527
01:00:38,000 --> 01:00:40,000
I am going to change to saw CS go.

1528
01:00:41,000 --> 01:00:43,000
After I swing it this guy over and over again.

1529
01:00:45,000 --> 01:00:47,000
So always one more life.

1530
01:00:47,000 --> 01:00:49,000
Yeah this is really the last life.

1531
01:00:49,000 --> 01:00:50,000
I'm not this is not a joke.

1532
01:00:50,000 --> 01:00:51,000
No more no jokes.

1533
01:00:51,000 --> 01:00:52,000
This is the last one.

1534
01:00:52,000 --> 01:00:53,000
Yeah.

1535
01:00:53,000 --> 01:00:56,000
I have to backstab at least one person and that's not the guy apparently.

1536
01:00:58,000 --> 01:01:00,000
And that's not the guy either.

1537
01:01:00,000 --> 01:01:02,000
It's going to be not that guy.

1538
01:01:02,000 --> 01:01:03,000
It's what's what's what's.

1539
01:01:05,000 --> 01:01:07,000
Now I can't backstab anybody.

1540
01:01:08,000 --> 01:01:09,000
Oh minus will pretend.

1541
01:01:10,000 --> 01:01:12,000
Oh let me do that pretender I am.

1542
01:01:14,000 --> 01:01:15,000
Come on get that knife.

1543
01:01:15,000 --> 01:01:17,000
Oh my god.

1544
01:01:19,000 --> 01:01:22,000
Well that's the end for me.

1545
01:01:24,000 --> 01:01:25,000
Oh thanks for playing guys.

1546
01:01:25,000 --> 01:01:26,000
Tf2.

1547
01:01:26,000 --> 01:01:27,000
I'm going to move on to some stuff.

1548
01:01:27,000 --> 01:01:28,000
Yep it's a go go.

1549
01:01:30,000 --> 01:01:33,000
You're full of fun losing every round.

1550
01:01:33,000 --> 01:01:36,000
I'm the only comment denominator here so I take full responsibility for that.

1551
01:01:38,000 --> 01:01:40,000
I've been on every losing team so far.

1552
01:01:43,000 --> 01:01:44,000
My bad guys.

1553
01:01:44,000 --> 01:01:44,000
My bad.

1554
01:01:45,000 --> 01:01:48,000
Well at least at least you got

1555
01:01:49,000 --> 01:01:53,000
play on the crazy teams that were getting beat.

1556
01:01:55,000 --> 01:01:55,000
Oh my goodness.

1557
01:01:55,000 --> 01:01:57,000
That was uh you were reaching for that one.

1558
01:01:57,000 --> 01:02:01,000
That really was actually I was doing two things at once and my brain was kind of like wait where am I?

1559
01:02:01,000 --> 01:02:03,000
Oh yeah I'm streaming I forgot.

1560
01:02:04,000 --> 01:02:08,000
So I'll probably play like maybe three two or three rounds of csgo just to check out the new update

1561
01:02:08,000 --> 01:02:09,000
because I wanted to check it out.

1562
01:02:10,000 --> 01:02:13,000
So screen is going to go black in a second here.

1563
01:02:14,000 --> 01:02:16,000
And yeah thank you for coming if you just came for the Tf2.

1564
01:02:17,000 --> 01:02:21,000
If you're sticking around with the csgo then it's going to happen in like four seconds.

1565
01:02:21,000 --> 01:02:23,000
Well not really but you get the idea.

1566
01:02:23,000 --> 01:02:27,000
The screen is going to go black in second.

1567
01:02:31,000 --> 01:02:33,000
Screen is totally not black bro.

1568
01:02:33,000 --> 01:02:35,000
Oh no there goes.

1569
01:02:35,000 --> 01:02:35,000
No it's black.

1570
01:02:36,000 --> 01:02:37,000
No it's not.

1571
01:02:39,000 --> 01:02:41,000
No it's no oh no that's wrong because I did screen region.

1572
01:02:42,000 --> 01:02:43,000
I pulled up the screen region.

1573
01:02:47,000 --> 01:02:48,000
Now it should be all screwed up.

1574
01:02:48,000 --> 01:02:49,000
Probably hear the sound though.

1575
01:02:52,000 --> 01:02:53,000
Get it into window mode.

1576
01:02:57,000 --> 01:03:00,000
Jeez okay anyways guys it's been fun.

1577
01:03:00,000 --> 01:03:02,000
Thanks for owning me time and time again.

1578
01:03:04,000 --> 01:03:05,000
How I get my kicks.

1579
01:03:07,000 --> 01:03:08,000
Well I'm just kidding it was a lot of fun.

1580
01:03:09,000 --> 01:03:11,000
And enjoy csgo.

1581
01:03:11,000 --> 01:03:13,000
I will catch you guys later.

1582
01:03:13,000 --> 01:03:14,000
Thanks for coming to me.

1583
01:03:14,000 --> 01:03:15,000
Always a pleasure.

1584
01:03:17,000 --> 01:03:25,000
Let's get the screen region that.

1585
01:03:27,000 --> 01:03:31,000
And huh okay let's play a couple rounds.

1586
01:03:31,000 --> 01:03:32,000
Let's see what they did.

1587
01:03:32,000 --> 01:03:33,000
Huge updates.

1588
01:03:33,000 --> 01:03:37,000
Let's find out exactly what they did in this update.

1589
01:03:41,000 --> 01:03:43,000
Have I ever I've I've watched South Park?

1590
01:03:44,000 --> 01:03:47,000
I used to love South Park back in the day.

1591
01:03:47,000 --> 01:03:48,000
It was one of my favorite shows.

1592
01:03:57,000 --> 01:03:59,000
That's right they did add a server bracket.

1593
01:03:59,000 --> 01:03:59,000
I gotta check that out.

1594
01:04:03,000 --> 01:04:04,000
If I can even get in here.

1595
01:04:07,000 --> 01:04:08,000
Still searching huh.

1596
01:04:10,000 --> 01:04:11,000
Let's try this again.

1597
01:04:12,000 --> 01:04:13,000
Find the game.

1598
01:04:20,000 --> 01:04:20,000
There we go.

1599
01:04:24,000 --> 01:04:25,000
Retreating data.

1600
01:04:29,000 --> 01:04:33,000
Yeah probably only gonna play maybe two or three rounds.

1601
01:04:33,000 --> 01:04:34,000
Maybe 10-20 minutes or so.

1602
01:04:34,000 --> 01:04:36,000
I just want to check out the new update in the honest.

1603
01:04:38,000 --> 01:04:40,000
Okay so this is the new map.

1604
01:04:40,000 --> 01:04:41,000
No maybe this is not one of the new maps.

1605
01:04:41,000 --> 01:04:42,000
Is it?

1606
01:04:42,000 --> 01:04:43,000
I think I've already seen I've already seen.

1607
01:04:43,000 --> 01:04:44,000
No maybe not.

1608
01:04:46,000 --> 01:04:47,000
Maybe it is a different map.

1609
01:04:49,000 --> 01:04:50,000
We'll find out.

1610
01:04:50,000 --> 01:04:50,000
Oh wait.

1611
01:04:54,000 --> 01:04:56,000
Oh try to pick up a headshot.

1612
01:04:56,000 --> 01:04:57,000
Damn.

1613
01:04:59,000 --> 01:05:01,000
So this is one of the new maps safehouse.

1614
01:05:03,000 --> 01:05:04,000
There are already is another one like this.

1615
01:05:04,000 --> 01:05:05,000
Isn't there?

1616
01:05:11,000 --> 01:05:13,000
This game is not free to play.

1617
01:05:13,000 --> 01:05:15,000
It is in beta right now.

1618
01:05:17,000 --> 01:05:18,000
It's in closed beta.

1619
01:05:22,000 --> 01:05:23,000
All right I gotta stay alive next time.

1620
01:05:24,000 --> 01:05:25,000
The most screwing around.

1621
01:05:27,000 --> 01:05:28,000
And the terror is one.

1622
01:05:30,000 --> 01:05:31,000
Will they be punched in pie?

1623
01:05:33,000 --> 01:05:34,000
You know what?

1624
01:05:34,000 --> 01:05:35,000
I can't we can't buy.

1625
01:05:36,000 --> 01:05:38,000
Why can we not buy items?

1626
01:05:38,000 --> 01:05:40,000
I thought that's what it said you could do.

1627
01:05:43,000 --> 01:05:44,000
I'm gonna go around this way.

1628
01:05:46,000 --> 01:05:48,000
Let's see if I can pull something off here.

1629
01:05:48,000 --> 01:05:49,000
No I don't want to climb up there.

1630
01:05:49,000 --> 01:05:50,000
That's a bad idea.

1631
01:05:54,000 --> 01:05:55,000
No I just saw somebody.

1632
01:05:56,000 --> 01:05:57,000
There we go.

1633
01:05:59,000 --> 01:06:00,000
Oh I'm dead.

1634
01:06:03,000 --> 01:06:03,000
Nope.

1635
01:06:04,000 --> 01:06:05,000
Nope.

1636
01:06:06,000 --> 01:06:07,000
Oh god.

1637
01:06:08,000 --> 01:06:09,000
Behind me.

1638
01:06:09,000 --> 01:06:09,000
He's behind me.

1639
01:06:12,000 --> 01:06:12,000
He's down.

1640
01:06:12,000 --> 01:06:13,000
Bomb's down here.

1641
01:06:16,000 --> 01:06:16,000
What you got?

1642
01:06:18,000 --> 01:06:19,000
It's only one of them left.

1643
01:06:23,000 --> 01:06:24,000
No that's a teammate.

1644
01:06:26,000 --> 01:06:26,000
There he is.

1645
01:06:28,000 --> 01:06:30,000
Henderson incorporated but most eliminations.

1646
01:06:34,000 --> 01:06:36,000
I forgot my name was Henderson incorporated.

1647
01:06:38,000 --> 01:06:39,000
The clickety-clack.

1648
01:06:41,000 --> 01:06:43,000
Now this game will do that.

1649
01:06:43,000 --> 01:06:44,000
You'll get a big clickety-clack.

1650
01:06:47,000 --> 01:06:48,000
I'm gonna somebody pop there.

1651
01:06:48,000 --> 01:06:49,000
I have any grades.

1652
01:06:52,000 --> 01:06:54,000
No nobody nobody.

1653
01:06:54,000 --> 01:06:55,000
Oh my god I'm getting stuck.

1654
01:06:55,000 --> 01:06:55,000
Get stuck.

1655
01:06:59,000 --> 01:06:59,000
This is right here.

1656
01:07:00,000 --> 01:07:01,000
Whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa.

1657
01:07:01,000 --> 01:07:02,000
Let's move uh.

1658
01:07:02,000 --> 01:07:04,000
You guys hanging out of a window.

1659
01:07:05,000 --> 01:07:05,000
What a creep.

1660
01:07:08,000 --> 01:07:11,000
That guy was legit like floating out of the window.

1661
01:07:14,000 --> 01:07:15,000
I want to do a different gun.

1662
01:07:15,000 --> 01:07:15,000
I don't like this gun.

1663
01:07:17,000 --> 01:07:19,000
Auto is upstairs right now.

1664
01:07:19,000 --> 01:07:20,000
He is uh.

1665
01:07:20,000 --> 01:07:23,000
I think he's created in the kitchen to be honest.

1666
01:07:24,000 --> 01:07:26,000
Because he's uh he's a wild dog.

1667
01:07:33,000 --> 01:07:34,000
Somebody kill somebody.

1668
01:07:35,000 --> 01:07:37,000
Who's auto?

1669
01:07:39,000 --> 01:07:43,000
Auto is my uh my little doxan chihuahua

1670
01:07:43,000 --> 01:07:44,000
double-man-pinter breed thing.

1671
01:07:45,000 --> 01:07:46,000
He's a real cutie.

1672
01:07:48,000 --> 01:07:49,000
He's a real cutie.

1673
01:07:51,000 --> 01:07:52,000
I don't play League of Legends.

1674
01:07:53,000 --> 01:07:55,000
It's too much for my brain to handle.

1675
01:07:57,000 --> 01:08:00,000
I feel the same way about League as I do about Starcraft.

1676
01:08:00,000 --> 01:08:03,000
And that is this already damn it.

1677
01:08:03,000 --> 01:08:05,000
Oh no I got to sit here forever.

1678
01:08:06,000 --> 01:08:09,000
I feel the same way about League as I do Starcraft.

1679
01:08:09,000 --> 01:08:10,000
The Starcraft is

1680
01:08:12,000 --> 01:08:13,000
everyone's just really really good.

1681
01:08:14,000 --> 01:08:18,000
And to be able to play that game you have to also be really really good.

1682
01:08:20,000 --> 01:08:22,000
Yeah I probably won't be playing that game anytime soon.

1683
01:08:27,000 --> 01:08:30,000
Well this is I don't want to just sit here.

1684
01:08:30,000 --> 01:08:32,000
I'm going to play a gun game after next round.

1685
01:08:33,000 --> 01:08:35,000
Because gun game is more action.

1686
01:08:36,000 --> 01:08:38,000
And I can actually pretty good at gun game.

1687
01:08:40,000 --> 01:08:42,000
See this game won't I'm not that good at.

1688
01:08:42,000 --> 01:08:45,000
Like the general CS go.

1689
01:08:45,000 --> 01:08:47,000
I'm not that good at you know what we're going to go play gun game right now.

1690
01:08:49,000 --> 01:08:50,000
It's a tomato.

1691
01:08:53,000 --> 01:08:54,000
Find a game.

1692
01:08:54,000 --> 01:08:55,000
Arms race.

1693
01:08:56,000 --> 01:08:57,000
You don't matter which one that's going to play it.

1694
01:08:58,000 --> 01:09:04,000
It's not gun game.

1695
01:09:06,000 --> 01:09:07,000
It sure is.

1696
01:09:12,000 --> 01:09:13,000
Gun game.

1697
01:09:13,000 --> 01:09:14,000
Gun game.

1698
01:09:17,000 --> 01:09:21,000
Oh I mean arms race is the technical term for it.

1699
01:09:21,000 --> 01:09:28,000
I love this map.

1700
01:09:28,000 --> 01:09:29,000
It's so interesting.

1701
01:09:33,000 --> 01:09:34,000
You heard I like it.

1702
01:09:34,000 --> 01:09:35,000
Oh I love the girl is man.

1703
01:09:36,000 --> 01:09:36,000
Favorite bands.

1704
01:09:37,000 --> 01:09:37,000
Not far.

1705
01:09:41,000 --> 01:09:42,000
From behind.

1706
01:09:42,000 --> 01:09:42,000
Ah.

1707
01:09:44,000 --> 01:09:45,000
He's right here.

1708
01:09:48,000 --> 01:09:50,000
Finally moving on moving on in the world.

1709
01:09:52,000 --> 01:09:52,000
Now where is he?

1710
01:09:56,000 --> 01:09:57,000
Oh there's too many of them.

1711
01:10:05,000 --> 01:10:06,000
Damn it.

1712
01:10:12,000 --> 01:10:17,000
Yeah keep in mind I'm playing this in a window like half the size of my computer screen.

1713
01:10:17,000 --> 01:10:19,000
So it can be kind of difficult to play this game.

1714
01:10:22,000 --> 01:10:23,000
How many?

1715
01:10:23,000 --> 01:10:24,000
Bolks doesn't take.

1716
01:10:30,000 --> 01:10:31,000
No I don't want to do that.

1717
01:10:32,000 --> 01:10:33,000
Oh.

1718
01:10:39,000 --> 01:10:40,000
Wait I got it.

1719
01:10:44,000 --> 01:10:45,000
Oh damn.

1720
01:10:45,000 --> 01:10:46,000
Yeah.

1721
01:10:49,000 --> 01:10:54,000
Yeah I wish my computer was good enough to play games in full screen and stream them.

1722
01:10:54,000 --> 01:10:57,000
But it is almost impossible to do that.

1723
01:10:58,000 --> 01:10:59,000
And I am getting destroyed.

1724
01:11:01,000 --> 01:11:01,000
My god.

1725
01:11:02,000 --> 01:11:04,000
The whole team is like 18 and 14 and.

1726
01:11:12,000 --> 01:11:13,000
I'm going this way.

1727
01:11:13,000 --> 01:11:14,000
I'm going this way.

1728
01:11:16,000 --> 01:11:22,000
I'm going to get out of town.

1729
01:11:24,000 --> 01:11:25,000
Damn it.

1730
01:11:32,000 --> 01:11:33,000
Hmm.

1731
01:11:36,000 --> 01:11:37,000
Give me that headshot.

1732
01:11:37,000 --> 01:11:38,000
God damn.

1733
01:11:39,000 --> 01:11:41,000
Yeah it's not my internet.

1734
01:11:41,000 --> 01:11:44,000
It's my computer just probably would not be able to handle it.

1735
01:11:44,000 --> 01:11:45,000
And I guess internet too.

1736
01:11:46,000 --> 01:11:51,000
To stream at like 1080 or 720 it takes a lot of bandwidth so.

1737
01:11:56,000 --> 01:11:57,000
Oh.

1738
01:12:02,000 --> 01:12:03,000
Oh what was I doing?

1739
01:12:04,000 --> 01:12:09,000
This potentially is the worst time like the worst game I've ever had in this entire game.

1740
01:12:10,000 --> 01:12:11,000
Like ever.

1741
01:12:11,000 --> 01:12:12,000
Haha.

1742
01:12:14,000 --> 01:12:16,000
It's making me look embarrassed.

1743
01:12:16,000 --> 01:12:16,000
No I don't care.

1744
01:12:17,000 --> 01:12:18,000
I'm just playing for fun.

1745
01:12:18,000 --> 01:12:19,000
I just want to check out the new stuff.

1746
01:12:21,000 --> 01:12:25,000
My favorite guerrillas song is probably Stylo.

1747
01:12:25,000 --> 01:12:26,000
I love Stylo.

1748
01:12:26,000 --> 01:12:27,000
Where is he?

1749
01:12:28,000 --> 01:12:29,000
I don't even know what that guy even was.

1750
01:12:38,000 --> 01:12:38,000
Ow.

1751
01:12:39,000 --> 01:12:40,000
Ow.

1752
01:12:42,000 --> 01:12:42,000
Oh.

1753
01:12:48,000 --> 01:12:50,000
Okay let's get a string of people together here.

1754
01:12:52,000 --> 01:12:53,000
Let's get a string of people together.

1755
01:12:57,000 --> 01:12:57,000
Now it's over to God.

1756
01:13:01,000 --> 01:13:02,000
Oh.

1757
01:13:02,000 --> 01:13:03,000
715.

1758
01:13:03,000 --> 01:13:06,000
Flip that score around and you got a great score.

1759
01:13:08,000 --> 01:13:09,000
All right this time it's going to be different.

1760
01:13:09,000 --> 01:13:11,000
The standard will be different.

1761
01:13:17,000 --> 01:13:22,000
You need to pray to the Bruins.

1762
01:13:23,000 --> 01:13:25,000
All powerful Bruins gods.

1763
01:13:27,000 --> 01:13:30,000
Please shine upon me your strength.

1764
01:13:32,000 --> 01:13:33,000
Let's see I got this.

1765
01:13:33,000 --> 01:13:35,000
My sensitivity might be wrong.

1766
01:13:35,000 --> 01:13:36,000
No it's not.

1767
01:13:36,000 --> 01:13:36,000
That's an excuse.

1768
01:13:39,000 --> 01:13:40,000
There we go.

1769
01:13:41,000 --> 01:13:43,000
Let's keep the ball rolling here.

1770
01:13:47,000 --> 01:13:48,000
We got Mersey.

1771
01:13:48,000 --> 01:13:49,000
Up top.

1772
01:13:49,000 --> 01:13:50,000
Oh boy.

1773
01:13:51,000 --> 01:13:53,000
Now get away.

1774
01:13:54,000 --> 01:13:55,000
Get away.

1775
01:13:57,000 --> 01:13:58,000
Oh damn wow.

1776
01:13:58,000 --> 01:13:59,000
When did he come from?

1777
01:13:59,000 --> 01:14:00,000
I don't know.

1778
01:14:00,000 --> 01:14:01,000
I don't know.

1779
01:14:01,000 --> 01:14:02,000
I don't know.

1780
01:14:02,000 --> 01:14:04,000
I don't know.

1781
01:14:04,000 --> 01:14:05,000
I don't know.

1782
01:14:05,000 --> 01:14:06,000
I don't know.

1783
01:14:06,000 --> 01:14:06,000
I don't know.

1784
01:14:06,000 --> 01:14:07,000
I don't know.

1785
01:14:07,000 --> 01:14:08,000
I don't know.

1786
01:14:08,000 --> 01:14:08,000
I don't know.

1787
01:14:09,000 --> 01:14:13,000
Where did that do would come from?

1788
01:14:16,000 --> 01:14:18,000
Ah going for the headshots.

1789
01:14:18,000 --> 01:14:19,000
Not getting them.

1790
01:14:20,000 --> 01:14:21,000
Not getting them.

1791
01:14:33,000 --> 01:14:33,000
There we go.

1792
01:14:34,000 --> 01:14:35,000
Ah.

1793
01:14:39,000 --> 01:14:40,000
PP90M1.

1794
01:14:41,000 --> 01:14:42,000
I think that's what I just had.

1795
01:14:45,000 --> 01:14:46,000
This is the shoot guns.

1796
01:14:46,000 --> 01:14:48,000
Oh now I can't go that way.

1797
01:14:49,000 --> 01:14:50,000
I'm going to wrap around this way.

1798
01:14:55,000 --> 01:14:57,000
Oh how does he not die?

1799
01:14:59,000 --> 01:15:00,000
Look at his health.

1800
01:15:00,000 --> 01:15:01,000
What did I even hit him with?

1801
01:15:01,000 --> 01:15:02,000
Like a sock?

1802
01:15:04,000 --> 01:15:04,000
I don't know.

1803
01:15:04,000 --> 01:15:05,000
I don't understand.

1804
01:15:05,000 --> 01:15:06,000
That guy had like 80% health.

1805
01:15:07,000 --> 01:15:09,000
And I hit him with like a wet sock apparently.

1806
01:15:11,000 --> 01:15:13,000
Geez my god.

1807
01:15:14,000 --> 01:15:16,000
That's insta death every single time.

1808
01:15:17,000 --> 01:15:19,000
No, no that guy's that guy was invincible.

1809
01:15:20,000 --> 01:15:22,000
How is that guy just invincible?

1810
01:15:22,000 --> 01:15:23,000
Somebody explained that to me.

1811
01:15:25,000 --> 01:15:26,000
No that's not you.

1812
01:15:31,000 --> 01:15:32,000
There we go.

1813
01:15:32,000 --> 01:15:33,000
Get out of it.

1814
01:15:33,000 --> 01:15:35,000
Oh no.

1815
01:15:35,000 --> 01:15:35,000
I'm going to die.

1816
01:15:37,000 --> 01:15:38,000
Invincible.

1817
01:15:40,000 --> 01:15:41,000
Unpredictable.

1818
01:15:46,000 --> 01:15:46,000
Somebody up top?

1819
01:15:47,000 --> 01:15:49,000
See buddy where they spawn.

1820
01:15:50,000 --> 01:15:51,000
Where the hell are you guys?

1821
01:15:55,000 --> 01:15:58,000
I just puke in my mouth.

1822
01:16:02,000 --> 01:16:03,000
Pue, pu, pu.

1823
01:16:07,000 --> 01:16:09,000
No.

1824
01:16:09,000 --> 01:16:11,000
How come I'm going to go across the map?

1825
01:16:11,000 --> 01:16:13,000
They just spawned over here.

1826
01:16:20,000 --> 01:16:22,000
Get my face in your face.

1827
01:16:27,000 --> 01:16:28,000
Get out of here.

1828
01:16:29,000 --> 01:16:29,000
Oh come on.

1829
01:16:30,000 --> 01:16:32,000
This guy's 20 and 9 right now.

1830
01:16:33,000 --> 01:16:34,000
My god.

1831
01:16:37,000 --> 01:16:39,000
What?

1832
01:16:42,000 --> 01:16:43,000
Man.

1833
01:16:51,000 --> 01:16:51,000
That's too many of them.

1834
01:16:55,000 --> 01:16:57,000
I at least want to be number one on the team.

1835
01:17:01,000 --> 01:17:01,000
Ow.

1836
01:17:01,000 --> 01:17:03,000
Get out.

1837
01:17:09,000 --> 01:17:10,000
Stop puking.

1838
01:17:16,000 --> 01:17:17,000
That's a compile.

1839
01:17:20,000 --> 01:17:21,000
Ow.

1840
01:17:22,000 --> 01:17:24,000
I at least want to go positive.

1841
01:17:25,000 --> 01:17:26,000
That's all I care about.

1842
01:17:27,000 --> 01:17:28,000
It's going positive.

1843
01:17:32,000 --> 01:17:33,000
Oh god.

1844
01:17:33,000 --> 01:17:34,000
I'm being freaking out right now.

1845
01:17:35,000 --> 01:17:36,000
Ah.

1846
01:17:36,000 --> 01:17:38,000
This guy's going to get a 9-level in two seconds.

1847
01:17:42,000 --> 01:17:43,000
To me, it's gold.

1848
01:17:47,000 --> 01:17:48,000
Ah.

1849
01:17:50,000 --> 01:17:52,000
Oh it hurts to die in this game.

1850
01:18:02,000 --> 01:18:03,000
Where is everybody?

1851
01:18:06,000 --> 01:18:07,000
That did not kill that guy?

1852
01:18:09,000 --> 01:18:10,000
Oh my god.

1853
01:18:10,000 --> 01:18:11,000
Spawning right next to me.

1854
01:18:12,000 --> 01:18:13,000
Ah.

1855
01:18:16,000 --> 01:18:18,000
Spawns are wacky in this game.

1856
01:18:18,000 --> 01:18:20,000
People just appear next to you.

1857
01:18:29,000 --> 01:18:30,000
Look at that.

1858
01:18:31,000 --> 01:18:33,000
Hmm.

1859
01:18:33,000 --> 01:18:34,000
Light machine guns.

1860
01:18:36,000 --> 01:18:36,000
Now come on.

1861
01:18:39,000 --> 01:18:41,000
No, somebody lost.
