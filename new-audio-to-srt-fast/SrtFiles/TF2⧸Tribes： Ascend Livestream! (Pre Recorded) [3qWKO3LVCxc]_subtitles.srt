1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
Do do do do do do do do do do do do do do?!"

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:05,000
Do do do do do do do do do do do do!

3
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:06,000
Oh, I can hear myself!

4
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:09,000
Gotta change that.

5
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:10,000
Oh, I can hear myself.

6
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:13,000
What's going on, guys?

7
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:19,000
Uh-uh.

8
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:22,000
How is your Saturday going?

9
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:25,000
Or potentially Sunday if you're from a different country?

10
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:29,000
Oh, I got it.

11
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:31,000
I'll save that for a second here. Hold on.

12
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:35,000
Okay, okay.

13
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:44,000
This is a little smaller on the right, are you?

14
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:46,000
So I'm trying something a little different.

15
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:48,000
And I am trying a...

16
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:51,000
I bought X-plit.

17
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:55,000
So I have X-plit here and I'm trying a few things.

18
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:57,000
I'm doing the capture source.

19
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:59,000
I'm not doing the screen region.

20
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:05,000
So it's probably going to be a little different or at least on your end it'll look the same on mine.

21
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:06,000
And it's going to be a little bit different.

22
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:10,000
All right.

23
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:20,000
Let me shot this out.

24
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:23,000
Twitter already had a pre-done.

25
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:25,000
Don't worry. It's all pre-done.

26
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:31,000
And is that?

27
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:37,000
And close that window.

28
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:42,000
I got to do the YouTube one.

29
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:45,000
Over the hack that is.

30
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:45,000
There it is.

31
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:55,000
Try and just hand-mood.

32
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:57,000
Post.

33
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:03,000
Okay.

34
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:05,000
Close that window.

35
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:12,000
And then I got this to do.

36
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:21,000
All right.

37
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:24,000
We're in business.

38
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:30,000
All right.

39
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:31,000
Let's get in here now.

40
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:38,000
So for those of you wondering.

41
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:39,000
I'm going to...

42
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:42,000
This is going to be uploaded to YouTube after this.

43
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:47,000
Probably what I'm going to start doing until YouTube gets its act together.

44
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:49,000
Because the last time I shot this,

45
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:50,000
I was like,

46
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:52,000
I'm going to be like,

47
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:54,000
I'm going to be like,

48
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:56,000
I'm going to be like,

49
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:57,000
I'm going to be like,

50
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:00,000
because the last time I streamed on YouTube,

51
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:02,000
last couple times I streamed on YouTube,

52
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:03,000
it was...

53
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:04,000
wasn't pretty.

54
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:06,000
There's a lot of problems, so...

55
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:09,000
maybe I'll try doing YouTube next week or something like that.

56
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:10,000
I'm not sure,

57
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:12,000
but this will be up on YouTube.

58
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:14,000
This whole thing.

59
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:19,000
All right.

60
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:24,000
Refresh again,

61
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:26,000
because I didn't check that.

62
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:29,000
Where from Massachusetts am I from?

63
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:31,000
I am from Boston.

64
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:35,000
I guess I'm not really from Boston.

65
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:37,000
I'm kind of from a suburb of Boston,

66
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:40,000
but I'm close enough where I can say I'm from Boston, I guess.

67
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:45,000
Let's get a zero out of...

68
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:48,000
let's try 24.

69
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:50,000
Any zero out of 32?

70
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:55,000
There is.

71
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:56,000
All right.

72
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:57,000
All right.

73
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:59,000
How about this one?

74
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:02,000
Here's the IP.

75
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:08,000
I know what Reading is.

76
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:11,000
I have family members in Reading.

77
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:13,000
That's pretty cool.

78
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:15,000
All right.

79
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:18,000
The IP is going in the chat right now.

80
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:24,000
Make sure I get in there first, and there you go.

81
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:29,000
What's going on, guys?

82
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:37,000
Bad water basin.

83
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:39,000
Let's fill this server up, huh?

84
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:52,000
Come on.

85
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:53,000
Let's go.

86
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:55,000
I don't got a whole day.

87
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:58,000
Who am I kidding?

88
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:00,000
I got plenty of time.

89
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:02,000
I get all the time in the world.

90
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:05,000
That's not really that true, but...

91
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:10,000
Zero out of zero.

92
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:14,000
Where is everybody?

93
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:19,000
I'm the only person that gives a right server.

94
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:21,000
I think I did, didn't I?

95
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:23,000
Hope I did.

96
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:27,000
I hope I came to the right server.

97
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:32,000
Make sure I did.

98
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:34,000
This is the one, right?

99
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:37,000
Yeah, okay.

100
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:39,000
Copy.

101
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:42,000
Yeah, I'm going to put it in there again, just in case.

102
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:45,000
Just in case.

103
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:55,000
All right.

104
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:57,000
It looks like that was the right server.

105
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:59,000
Who's the hope so?

106
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:05,000
I'll let you one fire.

107
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:09,000
Okay.

108
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:10,000
Cool.

109
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:16,000
I like your hat.

110
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:18,000
Nimbly, you get a cool hat.

111
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:22,000
First time in my stream, because you have six hours ahead.

112
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:24,000
It is late for you.

113
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:26,000
You are late, dweller.

114
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:31,000
Oh, that guy's lagging.

115
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:33,000
I don't want to kill him.

116
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:34,000
I feel bad.

117
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:36,000
That guy was like slow-botion.

118
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:44,000
Got my lemonade over here on the left.

119
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:48,000
It has been really nice out.

120
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:50,000
I don't know what it's been like for you guys.

121
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:54,000
But my goodness, it has been so beautiful out here lately.

122
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:58,000
It's been 75 degrees, 80 degrees, every single day.

123
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:00,000
And I've been going outside a lot.

124
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:02,000
I've been taking my new dog for walks.

125
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:04,000
You know that, Dale.

126
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:05,000
Oh, I actually killed him.

127
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:07,000
Oh, that's a, that's why.

128
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:11,000
Oh, nice shot, dude.

129
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:13,000
Nice shooting text.

130
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:16,000
Funny spots.

131
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:28,000
Alright, let me go out here.

132
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:29,000
Yo, boy.

133
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:31,000
Ooh, good dodging.

134
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:36,000
Jump into it.

135
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:37,000
Damn.

136
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:40,000
How long is streaming going?

137
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:41,000
I just started.

138
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:44,000
Literally just started like five minutes ago.

139
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:45,000
Oh, boy, that's dead.

140
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:53,000
Oh, come on.

141
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:00,000
Piro versus piro.

142
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:01,000
Oh, I didn't kill him.

143
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:08,000
Oh, I thought he was going to go to the...

144
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:10,000
I'm going to die.

145
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:12,000
He knows how much health I have.

146
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:14,000
Oh, run away.

147
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:15,000
Dead.

148
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:22,000
Aqua fire 102.

149
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:23,000
What's up, dude?

150
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:27,000
No demo man, no, I'll change this stuff.

151
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:29,000
Oh, by the way, if anybody has noticed,

152
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:30,000
I'm not sure if you've noticed.

153
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:32,000
Oh, God, that's great again.

154
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:35,000
But my, I changed my FOV.

155
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:36,000
I made it bigger.

156
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:37,000
I'll show you what I did.

157
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:41,000
I didn't make it too huge, but here's my FOV now.

158
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:43,000
I changed it to like...

159
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:48,000
Like 30% more, and I made my weapon view model like 30% more.

160
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:52,000
So if you've noticed that, I know a lot of people are saying,

161
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:54,000
please change that.

162
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:55,000
So I did.

163
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:57,000
It actually is a little bit better.

164
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:59,000
Easier to see things.

165
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:09,000
I got a healer now, alright.

166
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:13,000
Okay, he's got a buff.

167
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:17,000
Oh, I didn't kill him.

168
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:19,000
He walks right over and too.

169
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:21,000
What did he come from?

170
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:23,000
What did he even come from?

171
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:24,000
Was he the medic?

172
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:26,000
No, the medic was healing me.

173
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:29,000
Like, the medic behind me was healing me.

174
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:31,000
He just came out of legit nowhere.

175
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:33,000
Dear ENGY, I saft your centuries.

176
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:35,000
See you again soon, walled spy.

177
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:37,000
Spray over.

178
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:39,000
That's a nice spray though.

179
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:41,000
That's how he gets in here.

180
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:43,000
He's the light still alive.

181
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:45,000
Don't let him get me.

182
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:49,000
Don't let him get me.

183
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:51,000
Oh, he's got nowhere to go now.

184
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:53,000
How did he get that?

185
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:54,000
He's gonna get me.

186
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:56,000
He's doing a side stab.

187
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:58,000
I'm not gonna move.

188
00:09:58,000 --> 00:09:59,000
Yeah.

189
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:01,000
There we go.

190
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:04,000
Dear ENGY, I saft your century.

191
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:06,000
Oh, and I'll move that.

192
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:08,000
That's me.

193
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:09,000
Yeah.

194
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:11,000
Now we got to...

195
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:13,000
We're getting rolled right now.

196
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:15,000
Oh my god, I haven't done anything.

197
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:17,000
I wonder why I would have one kill?

198
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:24,000
Oh, you're making me waste my stuff scout.

199
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:30,000
Oh, come on.

200
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:33,000
How did I not hit him?

201
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:36,000
That's...

202
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:38,000
Get him out of here.

203
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:42,000
He's not dead.

204
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:44,000
He is not dead.

205
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:46,000
He is definitely still alive.

206
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:52,000
Alright, let's go for a super spam shot here, dude.

207
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:54,000
Come on, walk over that.

208
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:56,000
Oh my god.

209
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:58,000
Oh god.

210
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:00,000
Chaos.

211
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:01,000
Why am I...

212
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:02,000
What am I...

213
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:04,000
I got...

214
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:06,000
What am I waste?

215
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:08,000
Let me get the medic at least.

216
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:10,000
Oh, thank goodness.

217
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:14,000
If I didn't kill that medic, I would have been so upset with myself.

218
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:17,000
Oh, I can't...

219
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:22,000
Do I like Twitch or do I like YouTube better?

220
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:26,000
I mean, YouTube has a lot of problems right now.

221
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:28,000
There's a lot of glitches with YouTube.

222
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:30,000
There's a lot of bugs and stuff.

223
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:32,000
That's in beta, I can understand that.

224
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:34,000
But it's...

225
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:37,000
I would definitely say the process is much easier on Twitch.

226
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:40,000
That's what I'll just say at least.

227
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:44,000
The YouTube stream is better quality though, because I'm partnered on YouTube and I'm partnered through Mishinema.

228
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:48,000
So the YouTube stream will look better.

229
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:50,000
But, I don't know.

230
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:52,000
Hopefully they fix up some of their bugs.

231
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:54,000
I'm confident they will.

232
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:59,000
Oh, scout.

233
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:01,000
There he is.

234
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:03,000
Whoa!

235
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:09,000
It's really walked through there.

236
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:11,000
Medic!

237
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:14,000
Yeah, I'll go combat in Junex.

238
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:17,000
Absolute.

239
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:19,000
Look at all these people.

240
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:21,000
Like goodness.

241
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:23,000
Oh, don't use that. Don't use that.

242
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:27,000
Oh, man.

243
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:29,000
Oh, no.

244
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:33,000
Oh, come on.

245
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:35,000
Kill somebody.

246
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:37,000
Oh, my God.

247
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:39,000
Come on now.

248
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:41,000
Oh, I got the medic.

249
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:43,000
Good.

250
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:45,000
Oh, keep coming.

251
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:47,000
Oh, no! Come on, give me the help.

252
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:48,000
What?

253
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:50,000
Uber!

254
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:51,000
Escape.

255
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:53,000
Escape!

256
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:55,000
Damn.

257
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:57,000
But I didn't.

258
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:03,000
Boom.

259
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:06,000
Yeah, after this round, I'm gonna go combat, Angie.

260
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:09,000
Oh, there's a crit dude right there.

261
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:13,000
Oh, no, give me a way.

262
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:15,000
Where's the spy?

263
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:17,000
He's up top there.

264
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:19,000
He's going up this way.

265
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:21,000
Get up.

266
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:23,000
Why am I stuck in the staircase?

267
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:25,000
Is that another spy?

268
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:27,000
Yeah, there he is.

269
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:31,000
I love how it's just like everyone's running frantically around chasing this spy.

270
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:33,000
Oh, walk over that, please.

271
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:35,000
Somebody go to the left side.

272
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:37,000
Come on.

273
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:39,000
There you go.

274
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:41,000
I double-dogged there.

275
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:43,000
Can we go up there?

276
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:45,000
I'll leave that there.

277
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:49,000
That can be the defense.

278
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:51,000
Spam.

279
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:53,000
Oh, God.

280
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:55,000
Can we run the car?

281
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:57,000
No, I'm not yet.

282
00:13:57,000 --> 00:13:59,000
Get away from me.

283
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:01,000
Yeah, come on, get on the car now.

284
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:03,000
Come step on that car.

285
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:05,000
You know you want to.

286
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:09,000
Ah, come on, get him.

287
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:11,000
Somebody get on that car.

288
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:15,000
I want to blow it up.

289
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:19,000
I need to get healed.

290
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:21,000
There's a spy up.

291
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:23,000
It's fun, isn't there?

292
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:25,000
I might have to go deal with that.

293
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:27,000
Hold on.

294
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:29,000
Oh, I just launched myself into nowhere.

295
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:31,000
What is going on?

296
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:33,000
Why?

297
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:35,000
Why are they bouncing?

298
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:37,000
Oh, well, because...

299
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:39,000
Where's this spy?

300
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:41,000
He's freaking me out.

301
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:45,000
Is that a sniper?

302
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:47,000
No.

303
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:49,000
I've been to the police.

304
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:51,000
The IP I linked it a little while ago.

305
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:53,000
I'm going to be changing servers after this anyways.

306
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:57,000
And get more people into the game.

307
00:14:57,000 --> 00:15:01,000
There's a lot of people in this room.

308
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:05,000
Oh, this is definitely a lot of people still in here.

309
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:07,000
All crits.

310
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:09,000
Oh, I didn't get anybody.

311
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:11,000
Oh, damn.

312
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:15,000
Oh, man.

313
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:17,000
Soldier.

314
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:19,000
Hold on.

315
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:21,000
I got to deal with this.

316
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:23,000
That's a spy.

317
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:25,000
That's definitely a spy.

318
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:27,000
No way.

319
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:29,000
Maybe not.

320
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:31,000
No, it's not a spy.

321
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:35,000
Wow.

322
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:37,000
Oh, my God.

323
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:39,000
I was not ready for this, but I'm going to do it anyways.

324
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:41,000
Let's do it.

325
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:43,000
Come on.

326
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:47,000
Oh, you bastard.

327
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:49,000
Germa is a wizard.

328
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:53,000
Official.

329
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:57,000
Let's go.

330
00:15:57,000 --> 00:16:01,000
Oh, man.

331
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:05,000
Look at all those people.

332
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:07,000
Oh, man.

333
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:09,000
Look at all those people.

334
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:11,000
How am I doing?

335
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:13,000
I'm not that bad.

336
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:17,000
No, no 720 here.

337
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:21,000
I am not part of it on Twitch.

338
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:23,000
It's over.

339
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:25,000
I owe gaming.

340
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:29,000
Register today.

341
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:33,000
Oh, I killed myself.

342
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:35,000
Damn.

343
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:37,000
I want to start live streaming soon.

344
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:39,000
Any advice on how to get started?

345
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:41,000
Oh, yeah.

346
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:45,000
Most important thing is your internet needs to be able to handle it.

347
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:49,000
That's, I'd say, the number one thing is go to speedtest.net and run a speed test.

348
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:55,000
And I'd say if your upload speed is less than 1,

349
00:16:55,000 --> 00:17:09,000
like 1.0, 1 megabit per second up, I'd say it might be difficult for you to stream in good quality.

350
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:17,000
But if you're higher than 1 or 2 megs up, you should be fine to stream.

351
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:21,000
But I mean, you guys have been here before when I've had problem streaming.

352
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:23,000
I have 10 up connection.

353
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:25,000
And, oh my god.

354
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:27,000
Oh my god, somebody run over that.

355
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:31,000
Here we go.

356
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:35,000
Yes, yes, yes, that's what I wanted to run.

357
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:41,000
But you guys have been to streams before where it's been unwatchable from lag.

358
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:43,000
And I have a 10 up connection.

359
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:45,000
It's just weird.

360
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:47,000
The internet is a weird place.

361
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:55,000
And also, I'd also say you need a pretty good processor and video card.

362
00:17:55,000 --> 00:18:01,000
Because essentially your computer is doing kind of like double work.

363
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:09,000
Oh, no, I got crit rocket.

364
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:13,000
Oh, I got two cats, man. I love cats.

365
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:15,000
I love any animal.

366
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:23,000
The only animal that I could probably say I don't like is, I don't know, maybe like,

367
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:25,000
this is a hard question.

368
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:29,000
The only animal that I don't think I would like to, oh my god, another Uber student.

369
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:33,000
I like the Uber machine tonight.

370
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:39,000
Oh my god.

371
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:41,000
Oh, it's crazy.

372
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:47,000
Anyways, probably an animal big enough that will like literally kill me if I go near it.

373
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:53,000
So, probably something like that.

374
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:55,000
Oh, yeah, 4 up is fine.

375
00:18:55,000 --> 00:19:01,000
You'll be fine with 4 up.

376
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:05,000
Here we go.

377
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:07,000
Oh my god, I feel like,

378
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:11,000
I feel like the other team is getting neglected.

379
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:13,000
Spread the Uber's around.

380
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:15,000
I don't need them all.

381
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:17,000
No, I'm just kidding.

382
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:19,000
We're going up top here.

383
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:23,000
Or I can just apparently not detonate the mine.

384
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:25,000
What's going on here?

385
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:27,000
So many people.

386
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:31,000
So many people to spam.

387
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:35,000
This is chaos.

388
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:39,000
Oh, this is absolute chaos.

389
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:43,000
Oh my god.

390
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:45,000
This is ridiculous.

391
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:51,000
There are two player servers in sanity.

392
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:53,000
Yeah, this, oh my god.

393
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:59,000
Yeah, this is a full group in here, man.

394
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:03,000
Right after this round ends, I'm going to hop in a new server.

395
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:07,000
I'm going to hop in a new server.

396
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:11,000
I'm going to hop in a new server.

397
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:15,000
Oh, that's a double.

398
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:19,000
That's a double.

399
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:21,000
It's going up here.

400
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:23,000
Hey, hey you.

401
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:25,000
Oh, you're real.

402
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:29,000
I was going high five.

403
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:33,000
Oh, you want high five?

404
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:35,000
Oh, sure, I five.

405
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:39,000
And then just explode myself.

406
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:43,000
Wow, that was pretty unintelligent, dumpy.

407
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:47,000
But yeah, that's what I do.

408
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:49,000
All right, new server.

409
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:55,000
I'm going to say, you server.

410
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:59,000
Wait.

411
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:03,000
Oh, you want to see my brain.

412
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:05,000
A lot of you guys already know this.

413
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:07,000
Sometimes I just don't think.

414
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:13,000
It happens quite often actually.

415
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:15,000
All right, let's see.

416
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:23,000
Let's see here.

417
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:25,000
I would say let's play a randomizer server.

418
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:29,000
But for my streams, I like to get a lot of people into the games.

419
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:33,000
As many people as I possibly can that are watching.

420
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:39,000
So I don't want to just, you know, because most of the randomizer and arena mod tech servers, they're always full.

421
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:41,000
They always have, you know, 23 out of 24.

422
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:45,000
So I would be the only one that would be able to get in.

423
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:49,000
So I like to have people from the stream get priority and come in and play and stuff like that.

424
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:51,000
Let's find another server.

425
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:53,000
What is fun with 32?

426
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:57,000
All right, oh my god, there's so many loading.

427
00:21:57,000 --> 00:21:59,000
Looking for 32.

428
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:01,000
Hi, tower.

429
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:03,000
We're going to bunch of bots.

430
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:07,000
Well, I ever do a workout video.

431
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:09,000
I've thrown it around.

432
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:13,000
I was going to do it a long time ago.

433
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:17,000
But it's just, I don't know if people would even watch it.

434
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:23,000
I know that there would be a very small group of people that would probably watch it.

435
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:25,000
But I don't know if like how it would be received.

436
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:29,000
I think a lot of people would be like, what the hell are you doing?

437
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:31,000
Why are you like a Whiston Wates?

438
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:33,000
24 or 20?

439
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:35,000
You're 32.

440
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:37,000
Okay.

441
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:39,000
No, here we go.

442
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:41,000
Good old fashioned Dustball.

443
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:45,000
Here is the IP.

444
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:49,000
Oh, everyone's always asking about Enlighten.

445
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:51,000
The new Enlighten.

446
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:53,000
I'm working on it right now.

447
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:57,000
So there will be a new Enlighten in the next couple days.

448
00:22:57,000 --> 00:23:01,000
Working on it right now.

449
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:07,000
Yeah, I'll probably do another one of those videos where I give advice.

450
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:13,000
And I'll probably do like maybe a one or two minute vlog type thing where I show you some stuff.

451
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:17,000
But I'm not sure I would do like a 20 minute workout video.

452
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:21,000
Like, okay, then up, then down, then up, then left.

453
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:23,000
I think that would just be odd.

454
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:25,000
I mean, I think there would be very weird.

455
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:27,000
Let's go blue.

456
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:29,000
I was red last time.

457
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:35,000
Oh, boom.

458
00:23:35,000 --> 00:23:37,000
What do I want to use?

459
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:39,000
Oh, the new PDA.

460
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:41,000
What's going to be, oh my god.

461
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:43,000
He might not.

462
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:49,000
And oh, and down, and left, and egg.

463
00:23:49,000 --> 00:23:55,000
And egg.

464
00:23:55,000 --> 00:23:57,000
Alright, let me say this.

465
00:23:57,000 --> 00:24:01,000
Would you guys watch an egg workout video?

466
00:24:01,000 --> 00:24:07,000
Like if it was the egg.

467
00:24:07,000 --> 00:24:09,000
What do I want to even play with?

468
00:24:09,000 --> 00:24:11,000
Oh, I'll stay with this.

469
00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:13,000
I'll stick with this.

470
00:24:13,000 --> 00:24:15,000
Why not?

471
00:24:15,000 --> 00:24:19,000
Buh, buh, buh, buh, buh, buh, buh, buh, buh, buh.

472
00:24:19,000 --> 00:24:23,000
This server is like, is this server like weird?

473
00:24:23,000 --> 00:24:25,000
And it's like, I'm like lagging.

474
00:24:25,000 --> 00:24:29,000
Oh, I'm trying to, I tried to have an iPhone.

475
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:33,000
Oh, wait, you can just hold your hand like that?

476
00:24:33,000 --> 00:24:35,000
Oh, yeah.

477
00:24:35,000 --> 00:24:37,000
High five, baby.

478
00:24:37,000 --> 00:24:41,000
Alright, and I don't know if it's like the server enough.

479
00:24:41,000 --> 00:24:43,000
Is everybody like all jumpy?

480
00:24:43,000 --> 00:24:45,000
Because they are on my screen.

481
00:24:45,000 --> 00:24:47,000
Does anybody else see that?

482
00:24:47,000 --> 00:24:53,000
I don't want to, we'll go for one or two rounds like this.

483
00:24:53,000 --> 00:24:55,000
Oh, high five, here we go.

484
00:24:55,000 --> 00:24:59,000
Shloping.

485
00:24:59,000 --> 00:25:03,000
Yeah, I mean.

486
00:25:03,000 --> 00:25:07,000
I thought everyone's like jumping all over the place for me.

487
00:25:07,000 --> 00:25:11,000
Oh!

488
00:25:11,000 --> 00:25:13,000
Centred down.

489
00:25:13,000 --> 00:25:15,000
Hey, hey, hey.

490
00:25:15,000 --> 00:25:19,000
What do you think you're doing?

491
00:25:19,000 --> 00:25:21,000
Oh, but I forgot I was going to answer that question.

492
00:25:21,000 --> 00:25:25,000
The reason why I don't do auto reload is because it's somebody in here?

493
00:25:25,000 --> 00:25:29,000
Like the ghost of the pyro just in that room with me.

494
00:25:29,000 --> 00:25:31,000
Oh no.

495
00:25:31,000 --> 00:25:35,000
Alright, well, here we are.

496
00:25:35,000 --> 00:25:39,000
I'll block you way out.

497
00:25:39,000 --> 00:25:41,000
You can't get out. You're a dead ringer.

498
00:25:41,000 --> 00:25:43,000
I got you blocked in.

499
00:25:43,000 --> 00:25:47,000
Hey.

500
00:25:47,000 --> 00:25:51,000
That is a tip right there.

501
00:25:51,000 --> 00:25:55,000
If you shoot a dead ringer and you know he's a dead ringer,

502
00:25:55,000 --> 00:25:57,000
just stand in the middle of the hallway.

503
00:25:57,000 --> 00:25:59,000
And he can't get by you.

504
00:25:59,000 --> 00:26:03,000
Oh, just rats are going up up here.

505
00:26:03,000 --> 00:26:05,000
I don't know why I decided to put him here.

506
00:26:05,000 --> 00:26:07,000
It's a bad idea.

507
00:26:07,000 --> 00:26:09,000
Oh, yeah.

508
00:26:09,000 --> 00:26:11,000
Where is my mini-century?

509
00:26:11,000 --> 00:26:13,000
Why is it still alive?

510
00:26:13,000 --> 00:26:17,000
Oh my god.

511
00:26:17,000 --> 00:26:19,000
Getting distracted.

512
00:26:19,000 --> 00:26:21,000
I have ADD, man.

513
00:26:21,000 --> 00:26:23,000
Wow, we already won.

514
00:26:23,000 --> 00:26:27,000
My goodness.

515
00:26:27,000 --> 00:26:33,000
FG Spidey, Betia, I can say your name.

516
00:26:33,000 --> 00:26:39,000
I bet you a dollar, I can say your name.

517
00:26:39,000 --> 00:26:43,000
32-man Dust Bowl is chaos.

518
00:26:43,000 --> 00:26:47,000
I'm going to go Huntsman Schneipack.

519
00:26:47,000 --> 00:26:51,000
If you want to throw me a duel, I'll absolutely do it.

520
00:26:51,000 --> 00:26:55,000
Ah.

521
00:26:55,000 --> 00:27:01,000
Oh, now I go, let me say, I'm going to sign a Gosa.

522
00:27:01,000 --> 00:27:03,000
I think that's what you say.

523
00:27:03,000 --> 00:27:07,000
Sign a Gosa.

524
00:27:07,000 --> 00:27:11,000
Oh, by the way, if you're watching this on YouTube,

525
00:27:11,000 --> 00:27:13,000
because I'm going to upload this to YouTube afterwards,

526
00:27:13,000 --> 00:27:15,000
yes, I am responding to people in the chat.

527
00:27:15,000 --> 00:27:19,000
So don't just think I have some kind of weird disorder where I just say,

528
00:27:19,000 --> 00:27:21,000
we're random words.

529
00:27:21,000 --> 00:27:23,000
I guess I have that last time too.

530
00:27:23,000 --> 00:27:27,000
Oh, come on, this guy is going to get head shot right now.

531
00:27:27,000 --> 00:27:29,000
Right now, here we go, ready?

532
00:27:29,000 --> 00:27:33,000
I don't think you know, I don't think you understand.

533
00:27:33,000 --> 00:27:35,000
I don't think you understand, here it comes.

534
00:27:35,000 --> 00:27:39,000
Oh, my god, he killed me.

535
00:27:39,000 --> 00:27:41,000
Oh, no, a different guy did.

536
00:27:41,000 --> 00:27:43,000
Eggs.

537
00:27:43,000 --> 00:27:47,000
Look at this like egg.

538
00:27:47,000 --> 00:27:51,000
Man, this server is lagging from me.

539
00:27:51,000 --> 00:27:55,000
I'll tell you right now, oh, look at this double spy collateral.

540
00:27:55,000 --> 00:27:59,000
Oh, no, run away.

541
00:27:59,000 --> 00:28:03,000
Oh, tack!

542
00:28:03,000 --> 00:28:05,000
Oh, I can't even aim at people.

543
00:28:05,000 --> 00:28:09,000
My screen is like, did it take a jellyfish.

544
00:28:09,000 --> 00:28:11,000
Oh, he got me.

545
00:28:11,000 --> 00:28:13,000
He got me.

546
00:28:13,000 --> 00:28:15,000
Oh, he got me.

547
00:28:15,000 --> 00:28:17,000
Oh, he got me.

548
00:28:17,000 --> 00:28:19,000
Oh, he got me.

549
00:28:19,000 --> 00:28:21,000
He got me.

550
00:28:21,000 --> 00:28:29,000
Oh, whoa, whoa.

551
00:28:29,000 --> 00:28:31,000
Oh, look at the server.

552
00:28:31,000 --> 00:28:35,000
I don't think the server was designed that, but it's pretty people in it.

553
00:28:35,000 --> 00:28:39,000
Oh, wait, you want to get covered in jirati?

554
00:28:39,000 --> 00:28:41,000
Is that what you're saying?

555
00:28:41,000 --> 00:28:43,000
You want me to come smash you?

556
00:28:43,000 --> 00:28:45,000
Is that what you just said?

557
00:28:45,000 --> 00:28:49,000
I'm a fan of Kid Icarus.

558
00:28:49,000 --> 00:28:51,000
I never played it.

559
00:28:51,000 --> 00:28:53,000
Not even the original.

560
00:28:53,000 --> 00:28:55,000
And I'm an old bastard.

561
00:28:55,000 --> 00:28:57,000
And I didn't even play the original.

562
00:28:57,000 --> 00:29:01,000
Oh, that would have been sick.

563
00:29:01,000 --> 00:29:05,000
I heard somebody.

564
00:29:05,000 --> 00:29:11,000
I thought I'd love to kill somebody.

565
00:29:11,000 --> 00:29:13,000
Finally.

566
00:29:13,000 --> 00:29:15,000
I got my first kill, but whoa.

567
00:29:15,000 --> 00:29:17,000
That's because you see where I shot.

568
00:29:17,000 --> 00:29:23,000
If you're watching this like on YouTube, please rewind that and look at where I shot.

569
00:29:23,000 --> 00:29:25,000
I shot like five feet over that guy's head.

570
00:29:25,000 --> 00:29:27,000
I still killed him.

571
00:29:27,000 --> 00:29:31,000
Oh.

572
00:29:31,000 --> 00:29:33,000
Oh, god.

573
00:29:33,000 --> 00:29:37,000
Let's just, all right, let's do it.

574
00:29:37,000 --> 00:29:39,000
Oh.

575
00:29:39,000 --> 00:29:41,000
Oh, there's no way I was going to get out of there.

576
00:29:41,000 --> 00:29:43,000
A good affordable graphics card.

577
00:29:43,000 --> 00:29:45,000
That's a good one.

578
00:29:45,000 --> 00:29:47,000
Hmm.

579
00:29:47,000 --> 00:29:51,000
I'd say probably like the GTX 550 or the 560.

580
00:29:51,000 --> 00:29:53,000
I think those are both under 200 bucks.

581
00:29:53,000 --> 00:29:55,000
I think, under 100.

582
00:29:55,000 --> 00:29:59,000
I think the 550 is, I don't know, the 550 Ti, I think it's called.

583
00:29:59,000 --> 00:30:01,000
I don't even remember.

584
00:30:01,000 --> 00:30:03,000
Go.

585
00:30:03,000 --> 00:30:05,000
I missed him.

586
00:30:05,000 --> 00:30:07,000
I'm going to go.

587
00:30:07,000 --> 00:30:09,000
I think it's called.

588
00:30:09,000 --> 00:30:11,000
I don't even remember.

589
00:30:11,000 --> 00:30:13,000
Go.

590
00:30:13,000 --> 00:30:15,000
Oh, I missed him.

591
00:30:15,000 --> 00:30:19,000
I think Ag should be a weapon.

592
00:30:19,000 --> 00:30:23,000
I don't know how well they work.

593
00:30:23,000 --> 00:30:25,000
Oh, it's SimSass.

594
00:30:25,000 --> 00:30:27,000
You got the 550?

595
00:30:27,000 --> 00:30:29,000
How much is the 550?

596
00:30:29,000 --> 00:30:33,000
And follow up, is it a good graphics card?

597
00:30:33,000 --> 00:30:35,000
There we go.

598
00:30:35,000 --> 00:30:37,000
Did you get it?

599
00:30:37,000 --> 00:30:39,000
Did you get it?

600
00:30:39,000 --> 00:30:41,000
Oh, my God.

601
00:30:41,000 --> 00:30:43,000
Hey, let's go on.

602
00:30:43,000 --> 00:30:45,000
Just hiding over here.

603
00:30:45,000 --> 00:30:47,000
Away from you.

604
00:30:47,000 --> 00:30:51,000
No, no, please don't give me, please.

605
00:30:51,000 --> 00:31:01,000
Did you buy the 550 or did it come with your computer?

606
00:31:01,000 --> 00:31:03,000
No, I'm not.

607
00:31:03,000 --> 00:31:07,000
No, I'm thinking.

608
00:31:07,000 --> 00:31:09,000
I didn't get him.

609
00:31:09,000 --> 00:31:13,000
Oh, crap.

610
00:31:13,000 --> 00:31:15,000
Okay, yeah.

611
00:31:15,000 --> 00:31:17,000
So the 550 is only like $130.

612
00:31:17,000 --> 00:31:21,000
I'd say that's a good graphics card to be able to save a little bit of money.

613
00:31:21,000 --> 00:31:25,000
Because the 580 is, geez, what, like $500?

614
00:31:25,000 --> 00:31:27,000
Something like that?

615
00:31:27,000 --> 00:31:29,000
I know it's up there.

616
00:31:29,000 --> 00:31:33,000
And they're already working on the 600, aren't they?

617
00:31:33,000 --> 00:31:35,000
The 600 series?

618
00:31:35,000 --> 00:31:37,000
Oh.

619
00:31:37,000 --> 00:31:39,000
Is that?

620
00:31:39,000 --> 00:31:41,000
Okay, you're real.

621
00:31:41,000 --> 00:31:43,000
You're the real deal.

622
00:31:43,000 --> 00:31:47,000
I got you.

623
00:31:47,000 --> 00:31:49,000
Oh, cover them all.

624
00:31:49,000 --> 00:31:51,000
Okay, okay. Did I even get...

625
00:31:51,000 --> 00:31:53,000
No!

626
00:31:53,000 --> 00:31:55,000
Get this one guy!

627
00:31:55,000 --> 00:31:57,000
Come on.

628
00:31:57,000 --> 00:31:59,000
The 680 is out now.

629
00:31:59,000 --> 00:32:01,000
Oh, dear Lord, what is that?

630
00:32:01,000 --> 00:32:03,000
Like $900?

631
00:32:03,000 --> 00:32:09,000
You can only imagine.

632
00:32:09,000 --> 00:32:13,000
Woo!

633
00:32:13,000 --> 00:32:21,000
I don't think we're going to win this.

634
00:32:21,000 --> 00:32:25,000
Oh god, these people over there too.

635
00:32:25,000 --> 00:32:31,000
All right, I'm going this way.

636
00:32:31,000 --> 00:32:33,000
Is anybody up here?

637
00:32:33,000 --> 00:32:35,000
We almost just got it.

638
00:32:35,000 --> 00:32:37,000
Oh, he's still alive.

639
00:32:37,000 --> 00:32:39,000
He's still alive.

640
00:32:39,000 --> 00:32:41,000
Hey, he's turning on your...

641
00:32:41,000 --> 00:32:43,000
Oh my god.

642
00:32:43,000 --> 00:32:49,000
You guys like crushed that guy.

643
00:32:49,000 --> 00:32:51,000
Geez.

644
00:32:51,000 --> 00:32:53,000
Oh, forget that.

645
00:32:53,000 --> 00:32:57,000
I'm going this way.

646
00:32:57,000 --> 00:33:03,000
Oh my god.

647
00:33:03,000 --> 00:33:05,000
That's my favorite movie?

648
00:33:05,000 --> 00:33:07,000
Hmm.

649
00:33:07,000 --> 00:33:09,000
I don't know.

650
00:33:09,000 --> 00:33:17,000
Probably Ghostbusters or Memento or The Dark Knight or one of the Muppet movies or

651
00:33:17,000 --> 00:33:19,000
there's a lot of movies I've watched that I like.

652
00:33:19,000 --> 00:33:21,000
I'm not a big movie watcher though.

653
00:33:21,000 --> 00:33:25,000
I'm not even a big TV watcher either.

654
00:33:25,000 --> 00:33:33,000
Oh my god, I just missed his head.

655
00:33:33,000 --> 00:33:35,000
Oh, this guy could be toast.

656
00:33:35,000 --> 00:33:39,000
Oh my god.

657
00:33:39,000 --> 00:33:43,000
You know what I have for me?

658
00:33:43,000 --> 00:33:47,000
Oh, this guy doesn't even know I'm here.

659
00:33:47,000 --> 00:33:49,000
Damn it!

660
00:33:51,000 --> 00:33:55,000
Fight Club is also a good one, Ari.

661
00:33:55,000 --> 00:33:59,000
Fight Club is a good one.

662
00:33:59,000 --> 00:34:03,000
I'm over the first time I watched Fight Club.

663
00:34:03,000 --> 00:34:05,000
I was so confused.

664
00:34:05,000 --> 00:34:07,000
I think I was like 16 or like 17.

665
00:34:07,000 --> 00:34:09,000
When did that movie come up?

666
00:34:09,000 --> 00:34:11,000
Somebody do a quick research and find out when did Fight Club releasing?

667
00:34:11,000 --> 00:34:15,000
When did it come up with the others?

668
00:34:15,000 --> 00:34:17,000
Is somebody right in the foot?

669
00:34:17,000 --> 00:34:19,000
Ready?

670
00:34:19,000 --> 00:34:23,000
Oh my god, hide.

671
00:34:23,000 --> 00:34:27,000
I want to see if like, rampuck and beatbox?

672
00:34:27,000 --> 00:34:29,000
I don't think you can.

673
00:34:29,000 --> 00:34:31,000
I would assume rampuck could not beatbox.

674
00:34:31,000 --> 00:34:35,000
1999, okay.

675
00:34:35,000 --> 00:34:37,000
Oh!

676
00:34:37,000 --> 00:34:39,000
So that means I was.

677
00:34:39,000 --> 00:34:41,000
So 10 years ago was 2009.

678
00:34:41,000 --> 00:34:43,000
So 10, 11, 12.

679
00:34:43,000 --> 00:34:45,000
So that was 13 years ago.

680
00:34:45,000 --> 00:34:47,000
I was...

681
00:34:47,000 --> 00:34:49,000
Hmm.

682
00:34:49,000 --> 00:34:51,000
So I'm 26.

683
00:34:51,000 --> 00:34:53,000
16.

684
00:34:53,000 --> 00:34:55,000
15, 14, 13.

685
00:34:55,000 --> 00:34:57,000
I definitely didn't watch it when I was 13.

686
00:34:57,000 --> 00:35:01,000
I don't think my parents would have let me do that.

687
00:35:03,000 --> 00:35:07,000
Yeah, I mean, once I watched it,

688
00:35:07,000 --> 00:35:11,000
I think the first time I watched it when I was like 15 or 16, something like that.

689
00:35:11,000 --> 00:35:13,000
And I was confused.

690
00:35:13,000 --> 00:35:15,000
I was absolutely confused.

691
00:35:15,000 --> 00:35:19,000
Office space is a good movie too.

692
00:35:19,000 --> 00:35:23,000
The thing is, I've seen a lot of movies, but I don't watch a lot of movies.

693
00:35:23,000 --> 00:35:29,000
If that makes any sense to anybody, then, oh my god, I accidentally got that guy.

694
00:35:29,000 --> 00:35:31,000
Greetings from Chile.

695
00:35:31,000 --> 00:35:35,000
Well, greetings from East Coast USA, dude.

696
00:35:35,000 --> 00:35:39,000
It's either very early or very late for you.

697
00:35:39,000 --> 00:35:41,000
I'm not sure. Actually, no, I think we're in the same time zone.

698
00:35:41,000 --> 00:35:43,000
We're close, the same time zone.

699
00:35:43,000 --> 00:35:45,000
Oh my god.

700
00:35:45,000 --> 00:35:47,000
All right, time to play.

701
00:35:47,000 --> 00:35:49,000
Scout.

702
00:35:49,000 --> 00:35:53,000
My real name is Jeremy.

703
00:35:53,000 --> 00:35:55,000
It's Jeremy.

704
00:35:55,000 --> 00:35:57,000
J-E-R-E-M-Y.

705
00:35:57,000 --> 00:36:01,000
Look at all these people he's blowing out.

706
00:36:01,000 --> 00:36:03,000
Look at this good Pyro right here.

707
00:36:03,000 --> 00:36:07,000
Just running around blowing all the teammates out.

708
00:36:07,000 --> 00:36:09,000
You get a gold star.

709
00:36:09,000 --> 00:36:11,000
No, it's not Jeremiah.

710
00:36:11,000 --> 00:36:13,000
It's just Jeremy.

711
00:36:13,000 --> 00:36:17,000
Oh, there's a lot of people right there.

712
00:36:21,000 --> 00:36:25,000
Hmm, much, much, much.

713
00:36:29,000 --> 00:36:31,000
Okay, all right, Scout's not going to work.

714
00:36:31,000 --> 00:36:33,000
I'll go medic.

715
00:36:33,000 --> 00:36:35,000
Do I like Irish people?

716
00:36:35,000 --> 00:36:37,000
I do. I am Irish.

717
00:36:37,000 --> 00:36:39,000
I am Irish.

718
00:36:39,000 --> 00:36:41,000
I am Irish, so.

719
00:36:45,000 --> 00:36:47,000
Look at this server.

720
00:36:47,000 --> 00:36:49,000
All right, after a...

721
00:36:49,000 --> 00:36:51,000
I'm going to change servers after I die next.

722
00:36:51,000 --> 00:36:53,000
Just because this server is very laggy.

723
00:36:53,000 --> 00:36:55,000
Look at this guy.

724
00:36:55,000 --> 00:36:57,000
Looks like he's probably like a claymation.

725
00:36:57,000 --> 00:36:59,000
Look at this like claymation server.

726
00:36:59,000 --> 00:37:01,000
We're on.

727
00:37:01,000 --> 00:37:03,000
Oh, no, no, no, no.

728
00:37:03,000 --> 00:37:05,000
Oh, this is why I like the quick fix.

729
00:37:05,000 --> 00:37:07,000
Because you can just do this and it like makes sense.

730
00:37:07,000 --> 00:37:09,000
Oh, my God.

731
00:37:09,000 --> 00:37:11,000
That was the guy I had to steal.

732
00:37:11,000 --> 00:37:13,000
New server.

733
00:37:13,000 --> 00:37:15,000
Yeah, new server.

734
00:37:15,000 --> 00:37:17,000
Oh, yeah.

735
00:37:17,000 --> 00:37:19,000
He defeated me.

736
00:37:19,000 --> 00:37:21,000
Oh, yeah.

737
00:37:21,000 --> 00:37:23,000
He defeated me.

738
00:37:23,000 --> 00:37:25,000
Oh, yeah.

739
00:37:25,000 --> 00:37:27,000
Oh, yeah.

740
00:37:27,000 --> 00:37:29,000
Oh, yeah.

741
00:37:29,000 --> 00:37:31,000
He defeated me.

742
00:37:31,000 --> 00:37:35,000
Probably helping one more server.

743
00:37:35,000 --> 00:37:39,000
And try some tribes to send.

744
00:37:39,000 --> 00:37:41,000
Because that game is really cool.

745
00:37:41,000 --> 00:37:49,000
Let's go zero out of 24 this time just to keep the lag factor down a little.

746
00:37:49,000 --> 00:37:53,000
Can you give the health sawmill?

747
00:37:53,000 --> 00:37:55,000
Can you give the health nucleus?

748
00:37:55,000 --> 00:37:57,000
That could be good.

749
00:37:57,000 --> 00:37:59,000
Yeah.

750
00:37:59,000 --> 00:38:03,000
Can you give the health sawmill?

751
00:38:03,000 --> 00:38:05,000
Hi, tower.

752
00:38:05,000 --> 00:38:07,000
I'm torn guys.

753
00:38:07,000 --> 00:38:09,000
I don't know where to go.

754
00:38:09,000 --> 00:38:11,000
You are garbage germ.

755
00:38:11,000 --> 00:38:13,000
Why?

756
00:38:13,000 --> 00:38:15,000
What did I do?

757
00:38:15,000 --> 00:38:21,000
Oh, bad water.

758
00:38:21,000 --> 00:38:25,000
Mountain lab.

759
00:38:25,000 --> 00:38:29,000
A day in the life of germa.

760
00:38:29,000 --> 00:38:37,000
Where I just eat like Cheetos and take a bath.

761
00:38:37,000 --> 00:38:39,000
We're going to go here.

762
00:38:39,000 --> 00:38:43,000
We're going to go to buy a duck.

763
00:38:43,000 --> 00:38:45,000
Cautt buy it up.

764
00:38:45,000 --> 00:38:53,000
There's the IP.

765
00:38:53,000 --> 00:38:55,000
I put the IP right in chat.

766
00:38:55,000 --> 00:38:59,000
Should say a little camera next to my name.

767
00:38:59,000 --> 00:39:07,000
Let's go.

768
00:39:07,000 --> 00:39:11,000
Let's go.

769
00:39:11,000 --> 00:39:15,000
Let's go spy.

770
00:39:15,000 --> 00:39:17,000
This is a very weird load up.

771
00:39:17,000 --> 00:39:21,000
I don't know what I was trying to do here.

772
00:39:21,000 --> 00:39:31,000
I got the strange dead ring.

773
00:39:31,000 --> 00:39:33,000
The service full.

774
00:39:33,000 --> 00:39:43,000
What am I talking about?

775
00:39:43,000 --> 00:39:47,000
If you can't get in or trying to get in,

776
00:39:47,000 --> 00:39:53,000
I'm going to apologize.

777
00:39:53,000 --> 00:39:57,000
I think I do have a strange name.

778
00:39:57,000 --> 00:40:01,000
Oh, it's a depth.

779
00:40:01,000 --> 00:40:05,000
It's going to belong to somebody else pretty soon.

780
00:40:05,000 --> 00:40:11,000
Might as well rack up as many kills on it as I can.

781
00:40:11,000 --> 00:40:15,000
I'm an engineer walking out of you from the other side.

782
00:40:15,000 --> 00:40:17,000
Oh, you got me.

783
00:40:17,000 --> 00:40:19,000
Damn.

784
00:40:19,000 --> 00:40:23,000
How dare you kill me like that.

785
00:40:23,000 --> 00:40:35,000
If I could go pro at any sport, baseball.

786
00:40:35,000 --> 00:40:39,000
I've always wanted to be a baseball player.

787
00:40:39,000 --> 00:40:43,000
I'm not sure why, but I just have.

788
00:40:43,000 --> 00:40:47,000
I used to play baseball when I was younger.

789
00:40:47,000 --> 00:40:53,000
I didn't tell high school, and I stopped in high school.

790
00:40:53,000 --> 00:40:57,000
Oh, now they're going to all know that I'm dead wrong.

791
00:40:57,000 --> 00:40:59,000
Dead wrong.

792
00:40:59,000 --> 00:41:03,000
Is that anything like a word?

793
00:41:03,000 --> 00:41:05,000
All right.

794
00:41:05,000 --> 00:41:07,000
I'm going.

795
00:41:07,000 --> 00:41:09,000
I'm a pyro.

796
00:41:09,000 --> 00:41:11,000
I do that the best.

797
00:41:11,000 --> 00:41:17,000
Now it's just a scared chaos stab right there.

798
00:41:17,000 --> 00:41:19,000
What do you hear?

799
00:41:19,000 --> 00:41:25,000
The other team is still trickling in.

800
00:41:25,000 --> 00:41:29,000
Look, I'm just coming out of spawn in myself.

801
00:41:29,000 --> 00:41:31,000
Hey, let's get out of spawn together.

802
00:41:31,000 --> 00:41:33,000
What?

803
00:41:33,000 --> 00:41:35,000
Oh, German, I'm cheating.

804
00:41:35,000 --> 00:41:41,000
I'm watching you stream.

805
00:41:41,000 --> 00:41:45,000
Is my name even German right now?

806
00:41:45,000 --> 00:41:47,000
Oh, scrumple down.

807
00:41:47,000 --> 00:41:49,000
Harvey Hanberger.

808
00:41:49,000 --> 00:41:51,000
George Bumberson.

809
00:41:51,000 --> 00:41:55,000
I go by a lot of different titles.

810
00:41:55,000 --> 00:41:57,000
I'm going to get out of my way.

811
00:41:57,000 --> 00:41:59,000
Oh, you son of a b.

812
00:41:59,000 --> 00:42:03,000
Oh, that's like five million deaths in a row.

813
00:42:03,000 --> 00:42:05,000
It's by time to change up enough.

814
00:42:11,000 --> 00:42:13,000
Low FPS.

815
00:42:15,000 --> 00:42:17,000
Oh, what am I even using?

816
00:42:17,000 --> 00:42:19,000
Okay, I'll rock with this.

817
00:42:19,000 --> 00:42:21,000
I'll roll with this.

818
00:42:21,000 --> 00:42:23,000
I'm cool with that.

819
00:42:23,000 --> 00:42:27,000
Thought that was a spy.

820
00:42:27,000 --> 00:42:29,000
Oh.

821
00:42:29,000 --> 00:42:31,000
Oh.

822
00:42:31,000 --> 00:42:33,000
Oh.

823
00:42:33,000 --> 00:42:35,000
What just happened?

824
00:42:35,000 --> 00:42:37,000
Oh, my brain.

825
00:42:37,000 --> 00:42:39,000
There was a soldier right there.

826
00:42:39,000 --> 00:42:41,000
I just killed that medic.

827
00:42:41,000 --> 00:42:43,000
I'm sorry, dude.

828
00:42:43,000 --> 00:42:49,000
I don't think I've ever had a embarrassing name.

829
00:42:49,000 --> 00:42:53,000
Oh, my preferred breakfast food.

830
00:42:53,000 --> 00:42:55,000
Oh, you kidding me?

831
00:42:55,000 --> 00:42:57,000
Eggs.

832
00:42:57,000 --> 00:42:59,000
I had to say.

833
00:42:59,000 --> 00:43:01,000
What have we got here?

834
00:43:01,000 --> 00:43:03,000
All right.

835
00:43:03,000 --> 00:43:05,000
No more fooling around.

836
00:43:05,000 --> 00:43:07,000
Let's get some kills.

837
00:43:07,000 --> 00:43:09,000
Let's kill some bastards.

838
00:43:09,000 --> 00:43:11,000
Get on this point.

839
00:43:11,000 --> 00:43:13,000
Boys and girls.

840
00:43:13,000 --> 00:43:15,000
Where is he?

841
00:43:15,000 --> 00:43:17,000
You are a spade.

842
00:43:17,000 --> 00:43:19,000
You are a spade.

843
00:43:19,000 --> 00:43:21,000
You are a spade.

844
00:43:21,000 --> 00:43:23,000
Yep, he's here.

845
00:43:23,000 --> 00:43:25,000
It's invisible now.

846
00:43:25,000 --> 00:43:29,000
Oh, that was a total not good idea.

847
00:43:29,000 --> 00:43:31,000
Oh, what was...

848
00:43:31,000 --> 00:43:35,000
Did I jump in the air?

849
00:43:35,000 --> 00:43:37,000
Did I...

850
00:43:37,000 --> 00:43:39,000
What just happened to me?

851
00:43:39,000 --> 00:43:41,000
Oh, I'm sorry.

852
00:43:41,000 --> 00:43:43,000
I'm sorry.

853
00:43:43,000 --> 00:43:45,000
What just happened to me?

854
00:43:45,000 --> 00:43:47,000
I...

855
00:43:47,000 --> 00:43:51,000
I don't even understand how that happened.

856
00:43:51,000 --> 00:43:55,000
Maybe I did jump.

857
00:43:55,000 --> 00:43:57,000
That was weird.

858
00:43:57,000 --> 00:44:01,000
Kill Jerma.

859
00:44:01,000 --> 00:44:03,000
Nice name.

860
00:44:03,000 --> 00:44:07,000
Oh, three, two, one.

861
00:44:07,000 --> 00:44:11,000
Well, at least I got one kill.

862
00:44:11,000 --> 00:44:13,000
Tat around.

863
00:44:15,000 --> 00:44:17,000
Boy.

864
00:44:17,000 --> 00:44:19,000
Boy.

865
00:44:19,000 --> 00:44:21,000
Boy.

866
00:44:21,000 --> 00:44:23,000
How do you open console?

867
00:44:23,000 --> 00:44:25,000
It's the till day key.

868
00:44:25,000 --> 00:44:27,000
Thing under escape.

869
00:44:27,000 --> 00:44:29,000
Oh, I got some...

870
00:44:29,000 --> 00:44:31,000
I got some expert rocket jumping, guys.

871
00:44:31,000 --> 00:44:33,000
Here we go.

872
00:44:33,000 --> 00:44:35,000
Expert.

873
00:44:35,000 --> 00:44:37,000
Rocket jumper.

874
00:44:37,000 --> 00:44:39,000
Check me out.

875
00:44:39,000 --> 00:44:41,000
I'll be on...

876
00:44:41,000 --> 00:44:43,000
I don't even know what the name of the site is.

877
00:44:43,000 --> 00:44:45,000
So wait, why would I give up TF2?

878
00:44:45,000 --> 00:44:49,000
I thought I made this explicitly clear that I never was.

879
00:44:49,000 --> 00:44:53,000
TF2 is a huge part of my existence.

880
00:44:53,000 --> 00:44:55,000
I don't know what it is.

881
00:44:55,000 --> 00:44:57,000
I don't know what it is.

882
00:44:57,000 --> 00:44:59,000
I don't know what it is.

883
00:44:59,000 --> 00:45:01,000
I don't know what it is.

884
00:45:01,000 --> 00:45:03,000
I don't know what it is.

885
00:45:03,000 --> 00:45:05,000
I don't know what it is.

886
00:45:05,000 --> 00:45:07,000
Oh, I don't know.

887
00:45:07,000 --> 00:45:09,000
I don't know.

888
00:45:09,000 --> 00:45:11,000
Where is auto?

889
00:45:11,000 --> 00:45:13,000
It's a good question.

890
00:45:13,000 --> 00:45:15,000
That's just my brain.

891
00:45:15,000 --> 00:45:17,000
He's gonna know he's not.

892
00:45:17,000 --> 00:45:19,000
What is that?

893
00:45:19,000 --> 00:45:23,000
Oh, that was awful.

894
00:45:23,000 --> 00:45:27,000
There we go.

895
00:45:27,000 --> 00:45:31,000
Oh, can I get like a string or two or three or a row here?

896
00:45:31,000 --> 00:45:33,000
Oh, come on.

897
00:45:33,000 --> 00:45:35,000
Oh, come on.

898
00:45:35,000 --> 00:45:37,000
And you.

899
00:45:37,000 --> 00:45:39,000
All right.

900
00:45:39,000 --> 00:45:43,000
At least I'm killing people now.

901
00:45:43,000 --> 00:45:45,000
Oh, come on.

902
00:45:45,000 --> 00:45:47,000
Oh, come on.

903
00:45:47,000 --> 00:45:49,000
Oh, come on.

904
00:45:49,000 --> 00:45:53,000
And you.

905
00:45:53,000 --> 00:45:55,000
All right.

906
00:45:55,000 --> 00:45:59,000
At least I'm killing people now.

907
00:45:59,000 --> 00:46:05,000
Oh, my Liberty Launcher is now a new rank.

908
00:46:05,000 --> 00:46:17,000
Yeah, I understand that phenomenal.

909
00:46:17,000 --> 00:46:21,000
But to be honest, the items that I have in my backpack right now,

910
00:46:21,000 --> 00:46:25,000
I mean, I know I can understand like, oh, he's giving away his whole backpack.

911
00:46:25,000 --> 00:46:27,000
He's gonna quit.

912
00:46:27,000 --> 00:46:31,000
I mean, I have a lot of friends in Team Fortress.

913
00:46:31,000 --> 00:46:35,000
And a lot of people that, oh, God, hold on.

914
00:46:35,000 --> 00:46:37,000
Oh, God.

915
00:46:37,000 --> 00:46:39,000
I'm totally ruined that much.

916
00:46:39,000 --> 00:46:41,000
Oh, my God.

917
00:46:41,000 --> 00:46:43,000
But I've got a lot of friends in Team Fortress.

918
00:46:43,000 --> 00:46:47,000
And I have a lot of people that have, they support me with this channel.

919
00:46:47,000 --> 00:46:51,000
So any item that I ever want to use, I can just get it back.

920
00:46:51,000 --> 00:46:53,000
It might not be strange.

921
00:46:53,000 --> 00:46:55,000
It might not be genuine.

922
00:46:55,000 --> 00:46:59,000
Like I said in the video, I started with Team Fortress 2.

923
00:46:59,000 --> 00:47:03,000
And I got all the support from you guys from Team Fortress.

924
00:47:03,000 --> 00:47:07,000
A lot of you guys are Team Fortress guys.

925
00:47:07,000 --> 00:47:09,000
And that was a decent shot.

926
00:47:09,000 --> 00:47:12,000
And that's why I felt like doing it, you know,

927
00:47:12,000 --> 00:47:14,000
something I felt like doing.

928
00:47:14,000 --> 00:47:15,000
And mine's made up.

929
00:47:15,000 --> 00:47:17,000
There's no going back now.

930
00:47:17,000 --> 00:47:19,000
So it's gonna happen.

931
00:47:19,000 --> 00:47:21,000
And it looks to you if I can...

932
00:47:21,000 --> 00:47:23,000
No, there's a mini sector.

933
00:47:25,000 --> 00:47:29,000
All right, after this round,

934
00:47:29,000 --> 00:47:33,000
go to one more server, and then I'm gonna hop and try to send.

935
00:47:33,000 --> 00:47:41,000
Boing, boing.

936
00:47:41,000 --> 00:47:45,000
No, that was laggy.

937
00:47:45,000 --> 00:47:49,000
Oh, I didn't want to do that.

938
00:47:49,000 --> 00:47:51,000
Oh, my God.

939
00:47:51,000 --> 00:47:53,000
What is it going on with that guy?

940
00:47:53,000 --> 00:47:57,000
The guy was just skydiving right there.

941
00:47:57,000 --> 00:47:59,000
Oh, I'm dead.

942
00:47:59,000 --> 00:48:01,000
I am so dead.

943
00:48:01,000 --> 00:48:03,000
Oh, you lagged out?

944
00:48:03,000 --> 00:48:05,000
Yeah.

945
00:48:05,000 --> 00:48:07,000
Oh, I'm dead.

946
00:48:07,000 --> 00:48:09,000
I am so dead.

947
00:48:09,000 --> 00:48:11,000
Oh, you lagged out?

948
00:48:11,000 --> 00:48:13,000
Yeah.

949
00:48:13,000 --> 00:48:15,000
Oh, I'm dead.

950
00:48:15,000 --> 00:48:17,000
I am so dead.

951
00:48:17,000 --> 00:48:19,000
Oh, you lagged out?

952
00:48:19,000 --> 00:48:21,000
Oh.

953
00:48:21,000 --> 00:48:29,000
Mission ends in 60 seconds.

954
00:48:29,000 --> 00:48:33,000
Mission ends in 60 seconds.

955
00:48:33,000 --> 00:48:37,000
Oh, how did I not hit him?

956
00:48:37,000 --> 00:48:39,000
Many centuries.

957
00:48:39,000 --> 00:48:41,000
Get out of here.

958
00:48:41,000 --> 00:48:43,000
Oh, there's this sniper.

959
00:48:43,000 --> 00:48:45,000
Good to know.

960
00:48:45,000 --> 00:48:47,000
Oh.

961
00:48:47,000 --> 00:48:55,000
This is where we get the trouble.

962
00:48:55,000 --> 00:48:59,000
So, but it's snipers.

963
00:48:59,000 --> 00:49:01,000
He's still alive.

964
00:49:01,000 --> 00:49:03,000
Watch this spawn.

965
00:49:03,000 --> 00:49:09,000
Optimus Prime is on the loose.

966
00:49:09,000 --> 00:49:11,000
No, you're real.

967
00:49:11,000 --> 00:49:13,000
Where could he be?

968
00:49:13,000 --> 00:49:21,000
He's going to get on that point.

969
00:49:21,000 --> 00:49:23,000
Get on it.

970
00:49:23,000 --> 00:49:25,000
There we go.

971
00:49:25,000 --> 00:49:27,000
Everyone just stop on here right now.

972
00:49:27,000 --> 00:49:31,000
There we go.

973
00:49:31,000 --> 00:49:35,000
Ah, missed.

974
00:49:35,000 --> 00:49:37,000
All right, one minute, 40 seconds.

975
00:49:37,000 --> 00:49:39,000
We got this.

976
00:49:39,000 --> 00:49:41,000
Oh.

977
00:49:41,000 --> 00:49:43,000
Hmm.

978
00:49:43,000 --> 00:49:47,000
You got a backup.

979
00:49:47,000 --> 00:49:53,000
Damn, every time I shoot a crit rocket, it just goes right five.

980
00:49:53,000 --> 00:49:57,000
Track.

981
00:49:57,000 --> 00:50:05,000
Oh, bow.

982
00:50:05,000 --> 00:50:07,000
Oh, no, no, no.

983
00:50:07,000 --> 00:50:09,000
No, no, no.

984
00:50:09,000 --> 00:50:17,000
No, I just ruined this again.

985
00:50:17,000 --> 00:50:19,000
Oh, I'm sorry, medic.

986
00:50:19,000 --> 00:50:23,000
I'm an idiot.

987
00:50:23,000 --> 00:50:27,000
Oh.

988
00:50:27,000 --> 00:50:35,000
Yeah, tribes is a free to play game right now.

989
00:50:35,000 --> 00:50:37,000
I would suggest everyone to go get it.

990
00:50:37,000 --> 00:50:41,000
If you play team fortress, you probably like tribes.

991
00:50:41,000 --> 00:50:49,000
It's just another one of those kind of fast paced, you know, projectile based crazy fun games.

992
00:50:49,000 --> 00:50:51,000
FPS is the first version shooter.

993
00:50:51,000 --> 00:50:55,000
All right, so let's set on New Sir.

994
00:50:55,000 --> 00:50:57,000
New Sir, have a...

995
00:50:57,000 --> 00:50:59,000
All right, one more server here.

996
00:50:59,000 --> 00:51:03,000
Then I'm going to hop into tribes for probably like a half an hour or so.

997
00:51:03,000 --> 00:51:05,000
Okay.

998
00:51:05,000 --> 00:51:09,000
So you have 32.

999
00:51:09,000 --> 00:51:13,000
Okay, let's go to...

1000
00:51:13,000 --> 00:51:23,000
We got this one is open and it's dust bowl.

1001
00:51:23,000 --> 00:51:27,000
We just did we already did dust bowl.

1002
00:51:27,000 --> 00:51:29,000
Well, busy town.

1003
00:51:29,000 --> 00:51:31,000
That was busy town.

1004
00:51:31,000 --> 00:51:33,000
This one's well.

1005
00:51:33,000 --> 00:51:35,000
We can do well.

1006
00:51:35,000 --> 00:51:39,000
I'm actually known and I know that server might not be able to.

1007
00:51:39,000 --> 00:51:41,000
All right, we'll go to this one.

1008
00:51:41,000 --> 00:51:43,000
CTF well.

1009
00:51:43,000 --> 00:51:45,000
And there you are.

1010
00:51:45,000 --> 00:51:49,000
Everyone join it.

1011
00:51:55,000 --> 00:51:59,000
Empty randomizer.

1012
00:51:59,000 --> 00:52:01,000
Um...

1013
00:52:01,000 --> 00:52:05,000
I mean, randomizer...

1014
00:52:05,000 --> 00:52:09,000
Is it really empty?

1015
00:52:09,000 --> 00:52:13,000
So those servers are like legit empty right now?

1016
00:52:19,000 --> 00:52:21,000
No, okay.

1017
00:52:21,000 --> 00:52:25,000
Next week we'll do randomizer.

1018
00:52:25,000 --> 00:52:29,000
We'll do some randomizer next week.

1019
00:52:29,000 --> 00:52:33,000
Let's get...

1020
00:52:33,000 --> 00:52:35,000
I'm going to use...

1021
00:52:35,000 --> 00:52:37,000
The shortstop.

1022
00:52:37,000 --> 00:52:39,000
And the... I'm going to put on the whole set.

1023
00:52:39,000 --> 00:52:41,000
Why not, right?

1024
00:52:41,000 --> 00:52:43,000
Why not?

1025
00:52:51,000 --> 00:52:53,000
Go, go, go, go.

1026
00:52:53,000 --> 00:52:57,000
Oh, the runs have not even started.

1027
00:52:57,000 --> 00:52:59,000
I'm going to get a kill.

1028
00:52:59,000 --> 00:53:03,000
No, I'm not. Too bad.

1029
00:53:03,000 --> 00:53:05,000
Woohoo!

1030
00:53:05,000 --> 00:53:07,000
No, I'm going to sneeze.

1031
00:53:07,000 --> 00:53:09,000
I got a sneeze and there's nothing I can do about it.

1032
00:53:09,000 --> 00:53:11,000
Oh, I'm going to sneeze.

1033
00:53:11,000 --> 00:53:13,000
There I come.

1034
00:53:13,000 --> 00:53:15,000
No. No, I'm false alarm.

1035
00:53:15,000 --> 00:53:17,000
No.

1036
00:53:17,000 --> 00:53:19,000
Oh, man.

1037
00:53:19,000 --> 00:53:21,000
Sorry.

1038
00:53:21,000 --> 00:53:23,000
I'm just a mute me.

1039
00:53:23,000 --> 00:53:25,000
Are we getting spawn traps?

1040
00:53:25,000 --> 00:53:27,000
What's going on?

1041
00:53:27,000 --> 00:53:29,000
Thank you.

1042
00:53:29,000 --> 00:53:31,000
Thank you.

1043
00:53:31,000 --> 00:53:33,000
Manak!

1044
00:53:33,000 --> 00:53:37,000
Get me in here.

1045
00:53:37,000 --> 00:53:39,000
Oh, it's dead.

1046
00:53:39,000 --> 00:53:41,000
They got to get crits.

1047
00:53:41,000 --> 00:53:43,000
Oh, damn.

1048
00:53:43,000 --> 00:53:45,000
Oh, damn.

1049
00:53:45,000 --> 00:53:47,000
Oh, damn.

1050
00:53:47,000 --> 00:53:49,000
Oh, damn.

1051
00:53:49,000 --> 00:53:57,000
It's the Vizzi spider.

1052
00:53:57,000 --> 00:53:59,000
One of the water spouts.

1053
00:53:59,000 --> 00:54:01,000
Down came the rain.

1054
00:54:01,000 --> 00:54:05,000
And wiped out that goddamn spider.

1055
00:54:05,000 --> 00:54:09,000
I just bumped into a spider, but I don't care.

1056
00:54:09,000 --> 00:54:13,000
Oh, it didn't wake me.

1057
00:54:13,000 --> 00:54:17,000
Oh, man.

1058
00:54:17,000 --> 00:54:21,000
I did help.

1059
00:54:21,000 --> 00:54:25,000
Oh, you are not.

1060
00:54:25,000 --> 00:54:29,000
You are a real bowl.

1061
00:54:29,000 --> 00:54:33,000
He's still alive.

1062
00:54:33,000 --> 00:54:35,000
No, he's not.

1063
00:54:35,000 --> 00:54:37,000
Wait, what?

1064
00:54:37,000 --> 00:54:39,000
How was that?

1065
00:54:39,000 --> 00:54:41,000
Unless I actually really just killed him.

1066
00:54:41,000 --> 00:54:45,000
Go, top.

1067
00:54:45,000 --> 00:54:47,000
There's the health.

1068
00:54:47,000 --> 00:54:49,000
That's what I wanted.

1069
00:54:49,000 --> 00:54:53,000
Oh, god no.

1070
00:54:53,000 --> 00:55:03,000
This just bounced off the door and gave me the face.

1071
00:55:03,000 --> 00:55:07,000
Oh, no.

1072
00:55:07,000 --> 00:55:11,000
I'm gonna die.

1073
00:55:11,000 --> 00:55:13,000
Give me my milk.

1074
00:55:13,000 --> 00:55:17,000
Oh.

1075
00:55:17,000 --> 00:55:19,000
All right, several levels.

1076
00:55:19,000 --> 00:55:23,000
Thanks for coming, man.

1077
00:55:23,000 --> 00:55:25,000
Well, I ever do more dual commentary.

1078
00:55:25,000 --> 00:55:27,000
Oh, hell yeah.

1079
00:55:27,000 --> 00:55:29,000
I just took one the other night.

1080
00:55:29,000 --> 00:55:33,000
On CSGO with MLC stealth.

1081
00:55:33,000 --> 00:55:43,000
Oh, just jump over everybody trying to get around.

1082
00:55:43,000 --> 00:55:47,000
Oh, I was gonna get by the train.

1083
00:55:47,000 --> 00:55:51,000
Give me out of here.

1084
00:55:51,000 --> 00:55:57,000
Give me the stupid intelligence.

1085
00:55:57,000 --> 00:56:09,000
D-A-M-M damn damn.

1086
00:56:09,000 --> 00:56:13,000
Oh, what just fell?

1087
00:56:13,000 --> 00:56:15,000
I got backstabbed.

1088
00:56:15,000 --> 00:56:19,000
Gang it.

1089
00:56:19,000 --> 00:56:29,000
Special delivery.

1090
00:56:29,000 --> 00:56:33,000
All right.

1091
00:56:33,000 --> 00:56:35,000
Did it did did did did did did did.

1092
00:56:35,000 --> 00:56:37,000
Was this in low right?

1093
00:56:37,000 --> 00:56:41,000
German sucks in TF2.

1094
00:56:41,000 --> 00:56:43,000
We got a troll.

1095
00:56:43,000 --> 00:56:49,000
All right.

1096
00:56:49,000 --> 00:56:51,000
All right.

1097
00:56:51,000 --> 00:56:53,000
One more round of this.

1098
00:56:53,000 --> 00:56:57,000
I'm gonna go Pyro this time.

1099
00:56:57,000 --> 00:56:59,000
Hmm.

1100
00:56:59,000 --> 00:57:03,000
I always do not, I don't put on it.

1101
00:57:03,000 --> 00:57:07,000
Let's go.

1102
00:57:07,000 --> 00:57:09,000
Yeah.

1103
00:57:09,000 --> 00:57:11,000
All right.

1104
00:57:11,000 --> 00:57:13,000
Last round.

1105
00:57:13,000 --> 00:57:15,000
I'm gonna hop over to tribes.

1106
00:57:15,000 --> 00:57:21,000
I'll send.

1107
00:57:21,000 --> 00:57:23,000
Damn.

1108
00:57:23,000 --> 00:57:27,000
No.

1109
00:57:27,000 --> 00:57:29,000
All right.

1110
00:57:29,000 --> 00:57:31,000
I got to clear offline.

1111
00:57:31,000 --> 00:57:35,000
We can't have any spam coming at me.

1112
00:57:35,000 --> 00:57:45,000
I'm gonna go to the other side.

1113
00:57:45,000 --> 00:57:49,000
I'm gonna go to the other side.

1114
00:57:49,000 --> 00:57:53,000
Oh, no, no, no, no.

1115
00:57:53,000 --> 00:57:55,000
Somebody behind us still?

1116
00:57:55,000 --> 00:57:59,000
No, I turned it.

1117
00:57:59,000 --> 00:58:03,000
Oh, I don't think I even have the half of the degreaser said to be honest.

1118
00:58:03,000 --> 00:58:09,000
No, I don't have the half.

1119
00:58:09,000 --> 00:58:19,000
You know, I saw I thought I could get by and then I turned and skid the crap out of myself.

1120
00:58:19,000 --> 00:58:21,000
Oh my god, they have crits.

1121
00:58:21,000 --> 00:58:23,000
Shoot at me.

1122
00:58:23,000 --> 00:58:25,000
Come on.

1123
00:58:25,000 --> 00:58:27,000
All right.

1124
00:58:27,000 --> 00:58:31,000
Don't get it by the train again.

1125
00:58:31,000 --> 00:58:41,000
I almost got hit by the train again.

1126
00:58:41,000 --> 00:58:43,000
No, I'm gonna make it.

1127
00:58:43,000 --> 00:58:47,000
Oh, damn it.

1128
00:58:47,000 --> 00:58:55,000
Where's Burger Boy?

1129
00:58:55,000 --> 00:59:01,000
Where is Burger Boy?

1130
00:59:01,000 --> 00:59:07,000
How am I not letting him on fire?

1131
00:59:07,000 --> 00:59:11,000
Oh, is that mean we're gonna play tribes ascent with Burger Boy?

1132
00:59:11,000 --> 00:59:19,000
Special guest appearance from Burger Boy?

1133
00:59:19,000 --> 00:59:23,000
God damn it, Burger Boy.

1134
00:59:23,000 --> 00:59:25,000
Reveal yourself.

1135
00:59:25,000 --> 00:59:28,000
He has.

1136
00:59:28,000 --> 00:59:33,000
Burger Boy, Burger Boy's been in videos.

1137
00:59:33,000 --> 00:59:37,000
Oh, I'm out of ammo.

1138
00:59:37,000 --> 00:59:41,000
Oh, god.

1139
00:59:41,000 --> 00:59:43,000
Oh, my power jack.

1140
00:59:43,000 --> 00:59:47,000
Would I get one kill with it?

1141
00:59:47,000 --> 00:59:49,000
And me versus you.

1142
00:59:49,000 --> 00:59:55,000
What do you say, buddy? Let's do this.

1143
00:59:55,000 --> 00:59:59,000
I uh, I lost.

1144
00:59:59,000 --> 01:00:09,000
Oh, we got crits.

1145
01:00:09,000 --> 01:00:11,000
Yes.

1146
01:00:11,000 --> 01:00:15,000
I just want to crit fire somebody.

1147
01:00:15,000 --> 01:00:23,000
Feels good to crit fire.

1148
01:00:23,000 --> 01:00:27,000
It feels good to crit fire.

1149
01:00:27,000 --> 01:00:29,000
All right, we're going sniper.

1150
01:00:29,000 --> 01:00:35,000
No, we're not. I'm going heavy.

1151
01:00:35,000 --> 01:00:39,000
Run, run, run, run, run, run, run.

1152
01:00:39,000 --> 01:00:41,000
Get away.

1153
01:00:41,000 --> 01:00:43,000
Oh, come on.

1154
01:00:43,000 --> 01:00:55,000
B-U-L-L-S-H-I-T with six exclamation points after that.

1155
01:00:55,000 --> 01:00:59,000
Wait, why do I have to toss it, Equip?

1156
01:00:59,000 --> 01:01:05,000
Okay, whatever.

1157
01:01:05,000 --> 01:01:07,000
I'm so scared of.

1158
01:01:07,000 --> 01:01:11,000
All right, I killed this five from like 5,000 feet away.

1159
01:01:11,000 --> 01:01:13,000
Where is this guy? Oh, my god.

1160
01:01:13,000 --> 01:01:17,000
He's on the roof. I thought I was to the right.

1161
01:01:17,000 --> 01:01:21,000
All right, take this stupid thing off.

1162
01:01:21,000 --> 01:01:31,000
Give me the regular gun.

1163
01:01:31,000 --> 01:01:35,000
B-B-B-B-B-B-B-B-B-B-B-B-B-B-B-B-B-B-B-B-B-B-B-B-B-B-B-B-B-B-B-B-B-B-B-B-B-B-B-B-B-B-B-B-B-B-B-B-B-B-B-B-B-B-如.

1164
01:01:35,000 --> 01:01:39,000
All right, I got to like really watch my back now.

1165
01:01:39,000 --> 01:01:45,000
I'm playing heavy. Probably the worst idea I could have ever done.

1166
01:01:45,000 --> 01:01:49,000
I'm gonna be on fire.

1167
01:01:49,000 --> 01:01:51,000
Oh, thank you so much.

1168
01:01:51,000 --> 01:01:57,000
Oh, no, here comes another dude.

1169
01:01:57,000 --> 01:01:59,000
How are you still alive?

1170
01:01:59,000 --> 01:02:03,000
What? I can't find the train again.

1171
01:02:03,000 --> 01:02:11,000
Of course I can hit by the train again.

1172
01:02:11,000 --> 01:02:15,000
That would absolutely happen.

1173
01:02:15,000 --> 01:02:19,000
Oh, full of god.

1174
01:02:19,000 --> 01:02:23,000
Hey, we're gonna get Chris, I think.

1175
01:02:23,000 --> 01:02:27,000
I hope we get Chris right now.

1176
01:02:27,000 --> 01:02:31,000
Oh my god, of course, we get Chris and I die, and I'm dead.

1177
01:02:31,000 --> 01:02:39,000
Oh, take this out.

1178
01:02:39,000 --> 01:02:43,000
Take this out.

1179
01:02:43,000 --> 01:02:51,000
How are you still alive?

1180
01:02:51,000 --> 01:02:55,000
I knew it. I knew it was a guy behind us.

1181
01:02:55,000 --> 01:02:57,000
Oh, my god.

1182
01:02:57,000 --> 01:03:03,000
You got a 32 person server that's not just like ridiculous. They are like insane.

1183
01:03:03,000 --> 01:03:05,000
Insanity.

1184
01:03:05,000 --> 01:03:13,000
It's like you walk out the door and it's just like, oh, please.

1185
01:03:13,000 --> 01:03:15,000
Where is this guy?

1186
01:03:15,000 --> 01:03:17,000
I'm so scared of the spy just back.

1187
01:03:17,000 --> 01:03:23,000
It's definitely gonna happen right now.

1188
01:03:23,000 --> 01:03:31,000
Oh, I'll get it by the train again.

1189
01:03:31,000 --> 01:03:33,000
Oh, we won. How do we win?

1190
01:03:33,000 --> 01:03:37,000
How am I in the number two right now?

1191
01:03:37,000 --> 01:03:45,000
All right, well, good night if you leave it, man.

1192
01:03:45,000 --> 01:03:47,000
Thanks for coming.

1193
01:03:47,000 --> 01:03:51,000
So now I'm gonna head on to tribes.

1194
01:03:51,000 --> 01:03:57,000
I'm gonna head on to tribes.

1195
01:03:57,000 --> 01:04:01,000
And I'm gonna head on to tribes.

1196
01:04:01,000 --> 01:04:09,000
And do that.

1197
01:04:09,000 --> 01:04:15,000
Thanks for playing, everybody.

1198
01:04:15,000 --> 01:04:19,000
I gotta change this to save.

1199
01:04:19,000 --> 01:04:21,000
I'm gonna tell you that in a minute.

1200
01:04:21,000 --> 01:04:23,000
Let me open up tribes.

1201
01:04:23,000 --> 01:04:25,000
The screen might go black for a second, guys.

1202
01:04:25,000 --> 01:04:29,000
So I apologize.

1203
01:04:29,000 --> 01:04:35,000
The screen is going to go black.

1204
01:04:35,000 --> 01:04:37,000
So bear with me for one second.

1205
01:04:37,000 --> 01:04:41,000
While I load up tribes, I send.

1206
01:04:41,000 --> 01:04:43,000
Oh, I have ADHD.

1207
01:04:43,000 --> 01:04:45,000
Crazy bad.

1208
01:04:45,000 --> 01:04:49,000
I have really bad ADHD.

1209
01:04:49,000 --> 01:04:51,000
I'm sure my is dead.

1210
01:04:51,000 --> 01:04:53,000
I'm still here.

1211
01:04:53,000 --> 01:05:01,000
Talkness, it's all I see.

1212
01:05:01,000 --> 01:05:05,000
I already did a setup video, Hannibal.

1213
01:05:05,000 --> 01:05:07,000
Go to my 4000 subscriber video.

1214
01:05:07,000 --> 01:05:09,000
It should be there.

1215
01:05:09,000 --> 01:05:13,000
Don't go into the light.

1216
01:05:13,000 --> 01:05:15,000
Now my children.

1217
01:05:15,000 --> 01:05:17,000
Let me tell you something.

1218
01:05:17,000 --> 01:05:19,000
I am God.

1219
01:05:19,000 --> 01:05:21,000
Coming to you from the black screen.

1220
01:05:21,000 --> 01:05:25,000
Let me tell you all you need to do to have a good, fun, interesting life.

1221
01:05:25,000 --> 01:05:27,000
Is to crash.

1222
01:05:27,000 --> 01:05:33,000
Because that's what I think I just did.

1223
01:05:33,000 --> 01:05:35,000
Oh, no, no, I'm here.

1224
01:05:35,000 --> 01:05:37,000
Okay, okay, hold on.

1225
01:05:37,000 --> 01:05:39,000
I thought it was hard crash right there.

1226
01:05:39,000 --> 01:05:41,000
That would have been bad.

1227
01:05:41,000 --> 01:05:45,000
Alright, let me get into the game.

1228
01:05:45,000 --> 01:05:51,000
The screen should come back in about 10 seconds, guys.

1229
01:05:51,000 --> 01:05:53,000
Settings.

1230
01:05:53,000 --> 01:05:55,000
Audio.

1231
01:05:55,000 --> 01:05:57,000
Yeah, that's fine.

1232
01:05:57,000 --> 01:05:59,000
Video.

1233
01:05:59,000 --> 01:06:01,000
Window.

1234
01:06:01,000 --> 01:06:03,000
Come on, let's go window.

1235
01:06:03,000 --> 01:06:05,000
Windowed.

1236
01:06:05,000 --> 01:06:15,000
Change the resolution.

1237
01:06:15,000 --> 01:06:21,000
Alright, let me just add this game as a source into the exploit.

1238
01:06:21,000 --> 01:06:25,000
Should be good to go.

1239
01:06:25,000 --> 01:06:29,000
Game. Hello.

1240
01:06:29,000 --> 01:06:31,000
Is that gonna fit?

1241
01:06:31,000 --> 01:06:33,000
Is that work? Let's see.

1242
01:06:33,000 --> 01:06:35,000
I think that fits.

1243
01:06:35,000 --> 01:06:41,000
Pretty sure at least.

1244
01:06:41,000 --> 01:06:43,000
Get that out of the way.

1245
01:06:43,000 --> 01:06:45,000
What's with the double screen?

1246
01:06:45,000 --> 01:06:49,000
That's weird.

1247
01:06:49,000 --> 01:06:53,000
Hmm.

1248
01:06:53,000 --> 01:06:55,000
Hold on a second, guys.

1249
01:06:55,000 --> 01:06:57,000
I'm gonna change this.

1250
01:06:57,000 --> 01:06:59,000
This is a little glitchy.

1251
01:06:59,000 --> 01:07:01,000
I'm just gonna add the screen region.

1252
01:07:01,000 --> 01:07:05,000
That should be better.

1253
01:07:05,000 --> 01:07:09,000
Okay, yeah, there we go.

1254
01:07:09,000 --> 01:07:17,000
Alright, so that should be better.

1255
01:07:17,000 --> 01:07:25,000
Alright, so I think we're gonna get some people in here to talk while we play.

1256
01:07:25,000 --> 01:07:35,000
Those of you that have never played this game, please, my goodness, please go, please go download it.

1257
01:07:35,000 --> 01:07:39,000
It is an unbelievable game, and it's free.

1258
01:07:39,000 --> 01:07:43,000
What other reason do you need?

1259
01:07:43,000 --> 01:07:45,000
Move this.

1260
01:07:45,000 --> 01:07:49,000
It's not in the way.

1261
01:07:49,000 --> 01:07:53,000
To the left, to the right, to the right.

1262
01:07:53,000 --> 01:08:05,000
I need to be moved a little bit.

1263
01:08:05,000 --> 01:08:07,000
Alright.

1264
01:08:07,000 --> 01:08:13,000
It looks like it's centered, at least on my screen.

1265
01:08:13,000 --> 01:08:19,000
Alright, so we're gonna get anybody in this call.

1266
01:08:19,000 --> 01:08:21,000
Maybe.

1267
01:08:21,000 --> 01:08:25,000
Might happen to the audio.

1268
01:08:25,000 --> 01:08:29,000
Audio is still here.

1269
01:08:29,000 --> 01:08:33,000
Yeah, it's here, I can hear it.

1270
01:08:33,000 --> 01:08:37,000
Alright, somebody call me on Skype so we can start a call.

1271
01:08:37,000 --> 01:08:41,000
Boo or stealth or burger boy.

1272
01:08:41,000 --> 01:08:45,000
Whichever one of you guys wants to do this thing,

1273
01:08:45,000 --> 01:08:47,000
and then just join up.

1274
01:08:47,000 --> 01:08:49,000
They might have already been calling.

1275
01:08:49,000 --> 01:08:50,000
Yeah, they are.

1276
01:08:50,000 --> 01:08:52,000
What's up, burger boy?

1277
01:08:52,000 --> 01:08:54,000
Oh, burger boy.

1278
01:08:54,000 --> 01:08:56,000
Now burger boys call me.

1279
01:08:56,000 --> 01:08:58,000
Get out of here.

1280
01:08:58,000 --> 01:09:00,000
I'm inviting them this one.

1281
01:09:00,000 --> 01:09:02,000
Is that his door?

1282
01:09:02,000 --> 01:09:04,000
I was first.

1283
01:09:04,000 --> 01:09:06,000
Where's the talix?

1284
01:09:06,000 --> 01:09:08,000
It was offline.

1285
01:09:08,000 --> 01:09:10,000
He might be doing a band thing.

1286
01:09:10,000 --> 01:09:14,000
Oh, what's up, burger boy?

1287
01:09:14,000 --> 01:09:16,000
Make sure you guys are turning off.

1288
01:09:16,000 --> 01:09:20,000
Alright, if somebody else wants to join,

1289
01:09:20,000 --> 01:09:24,000
can you guys monitor or stealth can you monitor just in case I'm in the game?

1290
01:09:24,000 --> 01:09:26,000
Yeah, do it.

1291
01:09:26,000 --> 01:09:28,000
What's up, I think?

1292
01:09:28,000 --> 01:09:32,000
When I alt tab in a window, it explodes.

1293
01:09:32,000 --> 01:09:36,000
I can't really alt tab anymore.

1294
01:09:36,000 --> 01:09:38,000
But I want to pull the door.

1295
01:09:38,000 --> 01:09:42,000
You could play the game just every 10 seconds.

1296
01:09:42,000 --> 01:09:50,000
So if you want, it's going to be difficult to join the game off me right now,

1297
01:09:50,000 --> 01:09:54,000
because the way this game works is you have to have like,

1298
01:09:54,000 --> 01:09:58,000
I don't know how many friends you can have, to be honest, I really don't know.

1299
01:09:58,000 --> 01:10:00,000
But I'm going to go pathfinder.

1300
01:10:00,000 --> 01:10:02,000
Turn this up.

1301
01:10:02,000 --> 01:10:04,000
Stream is under control.

1302
01:10:04,000 --> 01:10:06,000
I'm going to stand and get.

1303
01:10:06,000 --> 01:10:10,000
Stream is under control, and I'm going to turn this up.

1304
01:10:10,000 --> 01:10:12,000
Can't hear it.

1305
01:10:12,000 --> 01:10:16,000
Alright, I think we can go with sound on the stream.

1306
01:10:16,000 --> 01:10:18,000
Should be.

1307
01:10:18,000 --> 01:10:20,000
Hey, burger boy, do you have drugs or something?

1308
01:10:20,000 --> 01:10:22,000
Oh, he's got it.

1309
01:10:22,000 --> 01:10:24,000
He's absolutely got it.

1310
01:10:24,000 --> 01:10:28,000
So this game, if you don't know what this is, if you're like, what the hell are you doing right now?

1311
01:10:28,000 --> 01:10:34,000
This game is pretty much a think of team fortress meets quake,

1312
01:10:34,000 --> 01:10:38,000
meets skiing, meets ski free, meets windows 95, meets windows 98.

1313
01:10:38,000 --> 01:10:44,000
I'm not sure if that made any sense, but this game is just, look at this, just chaos.

1314
01:10:44,000 --> 01:10:46,000
Pretty much think of this game as your, you play as a soldier,

1315
01:10:46,000 --> 01:10:50,000
like a Liberty Launcher soldier, and that's pretty much what everyone is using.

1316
01:10:50,000 --> 01:10:54,000
Then you ski around like a hundred miles per hour, it's all about momentum,

1317
01:10:54,000 --> 01:10:58,000
and we just really want the game.

1318
01:10:58,000 --> 01:11:00,000
Yeah, that's a good way to put it.

1319
01:11:00,000 --> 01:11:04,000
This game is Halo with Speedhacks and cooler mechanics in my opinion.

1320
01:11:04,000 --> 01:11:08,000
The music is cool.

1321
01:11:08,000 --> 01:11:10,000
I agree.

1322
01:11:10,000 --> 01:11:12,000
One gem of soda.

1323
01:11:12,000 --> 01:11:14,000
No, it's changed.

1324
01:11:14,000 --> 01:11:16,000
It's changed. You're going to do map.

1325
01:11:16,000 --> 01:11:22,000
But it's not really Halo. It's like a, it's cool in Halo in my opinion.

1326
01:11:22,000 --> 01:11:24,000
Just because I never really played Halo.

1327
01:11:24,000 --> 01:11:26,000
I guess you've never had an Xbox.

1328
01:11:26,000 --> 01:11:28,000
You've never could play.

1329
01:11:28,000 --> 01:11:30,000
I've never played Halo.

1330
01:11:30,000 --> 01:11:36,000
I had an Xbox, I had a 360.

1331
01:11:36,000 --> 01:11:40,000
One.

1332
01:11:40,000 --> 01:11:44,000
Two or three years ago was the last time I had one.

1333
01:11:44,000 --> 01:11:48,000
What's going on? Why am I stuck here?

1334
01:11:48,000 --> 01:11:52,000
I'm stuck in this lobby area.

1335
01:11:52,000 --> 01:11:56,000
There we go.

1336
01:11:56,000 --> 01:11:58,000
So it was lagging right there.

1337
01:11:58,000 --> 01:12:00,000
Scream was lagging.

1338
01:12:00,000 --> 01:12:04,000
You kidding me?

1339
01:12:04,000 --> 01:12:08,000
Let me know if it keeps happening, guys.

1340
01:12:08,000 --> 01:12:12,000
Let me try this again.

1341
01:12:12,000 --> 01:12:16,000
If it keeps happening, I might restart it.

1342
01:12:16,000 --> 01:12:24,000
Just change a couple settings.

1343
01:12:24,000 --> 01:12:26,000
This game is so satisfying.

1344
01:12:26,000 --> 01:12:28,000
I'm going bloody eagle.

1345
01:12:28,000 --> 01:12:32,000
You can get some real satisfying kills within this game.

1346
01:12:32,000 --> 01:12:34,000
Especially because it's all about a long range.

1347
01:12:34,000 --> 01:12:36,000
It's a long range and people.

1348
01:12:36,000 --> 01:12:38,000
It's awesome.

1349
01:12:38,000 --> 01:12:40,000
Did you quit and join a different game?

1350
01:12:40,000 --> 01:12:42,000
I did. Just join off me.

1351
01:12:42,000 --> 01:12:44,000
Oh, it's got one.

1352
01:12:44,000 --> 01:12:48,000
It like kicks me out.

1353
01:12:48,000 --> 01:12:50,000
Oh, sure.

1354
01:12:50,000 --> 01:12:52,000
I don't know.

1355
01:12:52,000 --> 01:12:54,000
It's so long.

1356
01:12:54,000 --> 01:12:56,000
It's too long.

1357
01:12:56,000 --> 01:12:58,000
It's a long queue up.

1358
01:12:58,000 --> 01:13:00,000
Bergerboy is not a loud play.

1359
01:13:00,000 --> 01:13:02,000
How did I not kill that guy?

1360
01:13:02,000 --> 01:13:04,000
Here we go.

1361
01:13:04,000 --> 01:13:06,000
This is a beta.

1362
01:13:06,000 --> 01:13:10,000
Oh.

1363
01:13:10,000 --> 01:13:14,000
It's another chill.

1364
01:13:14,000 --> 01:13:16,000
It's free though. It's open beta.

1365
01:13:16,000 --> 01:13:18,000
Is it free?

1366
01:13:18,000 --> 01:13:20,000
It's free.

1367
01:13:20,000 --> 01:13:22,000
It's free.

1368
01:13:22,000 --> 01:13:24,000
You get three shots.

1369
01:13:24,000 --> 01:13:26,000
Pretty much the pathfinder is like the scout.

1370
01:13:26,000 --> 01:13:28,000
You move around really fast.

1371
01:13:28,000 --> 01:13:32,000
Soldiers like the soldier, I guess.

1372
01:13:32,000 --> 01:13:36,000
There's like nine classes in this game.

1373
01:13:36,000 --> 01:13:38,000
I'm pretty sure there is.

1374
01:13:38,000 --> 01:13:40,000
This is just team deathmatch.

1375
01:13:40,000 --> 01:13:44,000
Essentially, why do we split the L?

1376
01:13:44,000 --> 01:13:46,000
We keep winning.

1377
01:13:46,000 --> 01:13:48,000
I'm going on.

1378
01:13:48,000 --> 01:13:50,000
I'm going on.

1379
01:13:50,000 --> 01:13:52,000
I do not quit this one.

1380
01:13:52,000 --> 01:13:56,000
Keep staying in this one.

1381
01:13:56,000 --> 01:13:58,000
General.

1382
01:13:58,000 --> 01:14:02,000
General.

1383
01:14:02,000 --> 01:14:04,000
You see this up here.

1384
01:14:04,000 --> 01:14:06,000
This is 2700xp.

1385
01:14:06,000 --> 01:14:10,000
Pretty much if you don't want to buy the game.

1386
01:14:10,000 --> 01:14:12,000
The game doesn't cost any money.

1387
01:14:12,000 --> 01:14:18,000
You can buy items if you don't want to wait and unlock them.

1388
01:14:18,000 --> 01:14:20,000
It's kind of like that.

1389
01:14:20,000 --> 01:14:22,000
If you want to spend money, you can.

1390
01:14:22,000 --> 01:14:26,000
If you don't, it takes a long time to get all the items and all the classes and everything.

1391
01:14:26,000 --> 01:14:30,000
It looks like it's exaggerated a long time.

1392
01:14:30,000 --> 01:14:32,000
Yeah.

1393
01:14:32,000 --> 01:14:38,000
Why do the hours of game time unlock a new class?

1394
01:14:38,000 --> 01:14:42,000
You start with three classes when you just get the game free.

1395
01:14:42,000 --> 01:14:46,000
You can spend 10-20 bucks and you'll unlock everything pretty much.

1396
01:14:46,000 --> 01:14:48,000
I'm going to go in-derma.

1397
01:14:48,000 --> 01:14:50,000
I'm going to go blood eagle.

1398
01:14:50,000 --> 01:14:54,000
Pathfinder again.

1399
01:14:54,000 --> 01:14:58,000
I'm going to turn the graphics down a tiny bit because I think people were saying it was lagging.

1400
01:14:58,000 --> 01:15:00,000
I'm going to boy you one on the other team.

1401
01:15:00,000 --> 01:15:02,000
Oh, we're a good boy.

1402
01:15:02,000 --> 01:15:06,000
I like switch teams in this game.

1403
01:15:06,000 --> 01:15:08,000
You're just first of the same.

1404
01:15:08,000 --> 01:15:12,000
You can just get them in switch teams.

1405
01:15:12,000 --> 01:15:14,000
Oh, this guy's toast down here.

1406
01:15:14,000 --> 01:15:16,000
This guy's toast guys.

1407
01:15:16,000 --> 01:15:18,000
Oh, get him.

1408
01:15:24,000 --> 01:15:26,000
I'm going to do my shot.

1409
01:15:26,000 --> 01:15:30,000
Finish this dude off.

1410
01:15:30,000 --> 01:15:32,000
There it is.

1411
01:15:32,000 --> 01:15:36,000
As you can see, I got a shotgun.

1412
01:15:36,000 --> 01:15:38,000
You pretty much only have two weapons.

1413
01:15:38,000 --> 01:15:40,000
I have grenades too, but I don't really use them.

1414
01:15:40,000 --> 01:15:42,000
I know I should, but...

1415
01:15:42,000 --> 01:15:46,000
...and see the top, the middle top, 97-92.

1416
01:15:46,000 --> 01:15:50,000
This is Team Deathmatch and essentially how this works is when you die,

1417
01:15:50,000 --> 01:15:52,000
one point gets taken off your side of the team.

1418
01:15:52,000 --> 01:15:58,000
But if your team has the flag or if their team has the flag, kills count is two.

1419
01:15:58,000 --> 01:16:00,000
I have the flag right now, so anytime we kill somebody on their team,

1420
01:16:00,000 --> 01:16:04,000
it's going to count as two points taken down from their score.

1421
01:16:04,000 --> 01:16:06,000
Oh, I just got nailed.

1422
01:16:10,000 --> 01:16:12,000
So it's lagging, huh?

1423
01:16:12,000 --> 01:16:14,000
Let me see if the hell is on here.

1424
01:16:14,000 --> 01:16:16,000
Wasn't doing this on Team Fortress.

1425
01:16:16,000 --> 01:16:18,000
No, it wasn't.

1426
01:16:18,000 --> 01:16:20,000
Let's find out what the hell is going on.

1427
01:16:20,000 --> 01:16:22,000
It's too graphed with landing strength.

1428
01:16:22,000 --> 01:16:24,000
Should be.

1429
01:16:24,000 --> 01:16:26,000
Shouldn't be.

1430
01:16:26,000 --> 01:16:28,000
I'm wondering.

1431
01:16:28,000 --> 01:16:30,000
You're still on CT?

1432
01:16:30,000 --> 01:16:32,000
Oh, yeah. I got the flag.

1433
01:16:32,000 --> 01:16:34,000
Come get me.

1434
01:16:34,000 --> 01:16:36,000
Oh, you're on the enemy team, huh?

1435
01:16:36,000 --> 01:16:40,000
Come here me, okay.

1436
01:16:40,000 --> 01:16:44,000
Destroy it.

1437
01:16:44,000 --> 01:16:46,000
Oh, come on.

1438
01:16:46,000 --> 01:16:50,000
Let's go. 1v1, baby.

1439
01:16:50,000 --> 01:16:54,000
Oh, I got me. Damn. Got me.

1440
01:16:54,000 --> 01:16:58,000
It looks okay on my end when I'm watching the stream right now.

1441
01:16:58,000 --> 01:17:00,000
It looks okay.

1442
01:17:00,000 --> 01:17:02,000
Maybe it was just like a little issue.

1443
01:17:02,000 --> 01:17:04,000
I don't know. Not sure.

1444
01:17:12,000 --> 01:17:14,000
But yeah.

1445
01:17:14,000 --> 01:17:16,000
Look at all those people in that.

1446
01:17:16,000 --> 01:17:20,000
Oh, I get, I get placed. Niper rifle.

1447
01:17:20,000 --> 01:17:22,000
Yeah, let's see.

1448
01:17:22,000 --> 01:17:24,000
When you go down, look at the left and right of my screen.

1449
01:17:24,000 --> 01:17:26,000
See how I have that power meter?

1450
01:17:26,000 --> 01:17:28,000
That's how fast I'm going when I ski.

1451
01:17:28,000 --> 01:17:32,000
The entire time you're going to be holding down space essentially in this game.

1452
01:17:32,000 --> 01:17:34,000
This is the flag.

1453
01:17:34,000 --> 01:17:36,000
All right.

1454
01:17:36,000 --> 01:17:38,000
Time to pull off something.

1455
01:17:38,000 --> 01:17:42,000
Get him with an air shot. Come on now.

1456
01:17:42,000 --> 01:17:50,000
I didn't get that guy.

1457
01:17:50,000 --> 01:17:54,000
Oh, go with people going for the flag.

1458
01:17:54,000 --> 01:17:56,000
You got to get rid of these people.

1459
01:17:56,000 --> 01:17:58,000
All right. Pick up the flag. Pick up the flag.

1460
01:17:58,000 --> 01:18:00,000
I got it.

1461
01:18:00,000 --> 01:18:02,000
Oh, protect me.

1462
01:18:02,000 --> 01:18:04,000
Oh, the italics isn't this game.

1463
01:18:04,000 --> 01:18:06,000
Drag him in the call.

1464
01:18:06,000 --> 01:18:10,000
The quiziest there.

1465
01:18:10,000 --> 01:18:12,000
Drag italics in here.

1466
01:18:12,000 --> 01:18:14,000
That was you.

1467
01:18:14,000 --> 01:18:16,000
Oh, well, that boy.

1468
01:18:16,000 --> 01:18:18,000
You know, friends.

1469
01:18:18,000 --> 01:18:20,000
Talik just blew me to hell.

1470
01:18:20,000 --> 01:18:22,000
And I blew him to hell.

1471
01:18:22,000 --> 01:18:28,000
No.

1472
01:18:28,000 --> 01:18:32,000
There we go.

1473
01:18:32,000 --> 01:18:33,000
Look at all these people ready.

1474
01:18:33,000 --> 01:18:34,000
Grenade.

1475
01:18:34,000 --> 01:18:38,000
Grenade.

1476
01:18:38,000 --> 01:18:40,000
Grenades are locked in this game.

1477
01:18:40,000 --> 01:18:42,000
Oh, there's a flag. Give me the flag.

1478
01:18:42,000 --> 01:18:43,000
Where am I?

1479
01:18:43,000 --> 01:18:45,000
No, that was a snipe flag right there.

1480
01:18:45,000 --> 01:18:47,000
I just totally snipe that flag.

1481
01:18:47,000 --> 01:18:49,000
I'm losing momentum.

1482
01:18:49,000 --> 01:18:51,000
I'm going to go.

1483
01:18:51,000 --> 01:18:57,000
I'm going to go.

1484
01:18:57,000 --> 01:18:59,000
I tried to settle before it.

1485
01:18:59,000 --> 01:19:03,000
I'm not very good at it.

1486
01:19:03,000 --> 01:19:09,000
God, I'm being chased by like a mob of people.

1487
01:19:09,000 --> 01:19:11,000
Well, Chris Z and all the people start following you.

1488
01:19:11,000 --> 01:19:13,000
What?

1489
01:19:13,000 --> 01:19:15,000
I'm going to drop the flag.

1490
01:19:15,000 --> 01:19:17,000
Yeah, because I'm going to drop the flag.

1491
01:19:17,000 --> 01:19:19,000
Still got it.

1492
01:19:19,000 --> 01:19:21,000
Oh, maybe not anymore.

1493
01:19:21,000 --> 01:19:23,000
Protect me, still.

1494
01:19:23,000 --> 01:19:25,000
Oh, they got me.

1495
01:19:25,000 --> 01:19:29,000
Well, let me drag italics in here.

1496
01:19:29,000 --> 01:19:33,000
All right, he's coming.

1497
01:19:33,000 --> 01:19:37,000
There it is.

1498
01:19:37,000 --> 01:19:39,000
One more.

1499
01:19:39,000 --> 01:19:41,000
Maybe.

1500
01:19:41,000 --> 01:19:43,000
Give me that flag.

1501
01:19:43,000 --> 01:19:45,000
One more.

1502
01:19:45,000 --> 01:19:47,000
Oh, one more.

1503
01:19:47,000 --> 01:19:49,000
What's going on?

1504
01:19:49,000 --> 01:19:51,000
What's up, man?

1505
01:19:51,000 --> 01:19:53,000
Play in the flag, man.

1506
01:19:53,000 --> 01:19:57,000
Like I do.

1507
01:19:57,000 --> 01:19:59,000
Yeah, we got some good flag control.

1508
01:19:59,000 --> 01:20:01,000
It's about like burger boys like terrible at this game.

1509
01:20:01,000 --> 01:20:05,000
He could like really like do something right now.

1510
01:20:05,000 --> 01:20:09,000
I can't even figure out how to switch games.

1511
01:20:09,000 --> 01:20:11,000
It is.

1512
01:20:11,000 --> 01:20:15,000
And then go to change.

1513
01:20:15,000 --> 01:20:19,000
I don't want to be on this team anymore.

1514
01:20:19,000 --> 01:20:23,000
I think the mlsc still just lied to you.

1515
01:20:23,000 --> 01:20:25,000
That's absolutely true.

1516
01:20:25,000 --> 01:20:27,000
I just did it.

1517
01:20:27,000 --> 01:20:31,000
That's what I'm going to say.

1518
01:20:31,000 --> 01:20:33,000
I can't.

1519
01:20:33,000 --> 01:20:35,000
There's not enough people on that team.

1520
01:20:35,000 --> 01:20:39,000
Oh, this guy is so toast right now.

1521
01:20:39,000 --> 01:20:41,000
Here we go.

1522
01:20:41,000 --> 01:20:43,000
Oh, come on.

1523
01:20:43,000 --> 01:20:47,000
Get him with those shots.

1524
01:20:47,000 --> 01:20:49,000
Oh, fine.

1525
01:20:49,000 --> 01:20:51,000
Whatever.

1526
01:20:51,000 --> 01:20:53,000
I'll go with this thing.

1527
01:20:53,000 --> 01:20:57,000
There's just a swarm of red upside down triangles around that flag.

1528
01:20:57,000 --> 01:20:59,000
Oh, still you got the flag.

1529
01:20:59,000 --> 01:21:01,000
I'm going to do it.

1530
01:21:01,000 --> 01:21:05,000
Let's do a little bit of team work.

1531
01:21:05,000 --> 01:21:07,000
I'm close to here.

1532
01:21:07,000 --> 01:21:09,000
Watch how I go.

1533
01:21:09,000 --> 01:21:11,000
Yeah, if we're still playing already, definitely.

1534
01:21:11,000 --> 01:21:13,000
I get you in here.

1535
01:21:13,000 --> 01:21:15,000
Oh, that is burger boy.

1536
01:21:15,000 --> 01:21:17,000
Oh, burger boy.

1537
01:21:17,000 --> 01:21:19,000
Right.

1538
01:21:19,000 --> 01:21:21,000
Oh, right there.

1539
01:21:21,000 --> 01:21:25,000
Oh, burger boy.

1540
01:21:25,000 --> 01:21:27,000
That's what you're.

1541
01:21:27,000 --> 01:21:29,000
Oh, I think the teams are even.

1542
01:21:29,000 --> 01:21:31,000
Oh, no, no, yeah.

1543
01:21:31,000 --> 01:21:33,000
You're not yet.

1544
01:21:33,000 --> 01:21:35,000
I've been to all the auto balance moves, I guess.

1545
01:21:35,000 --> 01:21:37,000
Yeah.

1546
01:21:37,000 --> 01:21:39,000
Well, this game's almost over.

1547
01:21:39,000 --> 01:21:41,000
We're almost going to lose.

1548
01:21:41,000 --> 01:21:43,000
Oh, but I have a flag.

1549
01:21:43,000 --> 01:21:45,000
That's good.

1550
01:21:45,000 --> 01:21:47,000
Yeah.

1551
01:21:47,000 --> 01:21:49,000
All right. So do not die.

1552
01:21:49,000 --> 01:21:51,000
Nobody died.

1553
01:21:51,000 --> 01:21:53,000
Nobody died.

1554
01:21:53,000 --> 01:21:55,000
Nobody won't.

1555
01:21:55,000 --> 01:21:56,000
That's going to be a long range.

1556
01:21:56,000 --> 01:21:58,000
I know.

1557
01:21:58,000 --> 01:22:00,000
I'm going to see you flying around the map right now.

1558
01:22:00,000 --> 01:22:02,000
I'm going to chase you for so long.

1559
01:22:02,000 --> 01:22:04,000
I'm going to be dead.

1560
01:22:04,000 --> 01:22:06,000
Like shooting burger boy from behind.

1561
01:22:06,000 --> 01:22:08,000
He's just like right behind me.

1562
01:22:08,000 --> 01:22:10,000
Oh, watch out.

1563
01:22:10,000 --> 01:22:12,000
Burger boy is going to take us all on.

1564
01:22:12,000 --> 01:22:14,000
Somebody took him out.

1565
01:22:14,000 --> 01:22:16,000
I don't know who.

1566
01:22:16,000 --> 01:22:18,000
Got an assist.

1567
01:22:18,000 --> 01:22:20,000
Burger boy.

1568
01:22:20,000 --> 01:22:22,000
I can't even catch up with still.

1569
01:22:22,000 --> 01:22:24,000
And I'm on his team.

1570
01:22:24,000 --> 01:22:26,000
Try and get on the steam out.

1571
01:22:26,000 --> 01:22:28,000
Like a phone.

1572
01:22:28,000 --> 01:22:30,000
Try and get on this team.

1573
01:22:30,000 --> 01:22:32,000
Burger boy, the insensitive one.

1574
01:22:32,000 --> 01:22:34,000
All right.

1575
01:22:34,000 --> 01:22:36,000
Let's see if anyone's made into the MPP statistics.

1576
01:22:36,000 --> 01:22:38,000
No, we sure didn't.

1577
01:22:38,000 --> 01:22:42,000
Yeah, you got the mLC still flag held top accolade.

1578
01:22:42,000 --> 01:22:44,000
Whoa.

1579
01:22:44,000 --> 01:22:46,000
You got like a top medal.

1580
01:22:46,000 --> 01:22:48,000
You didn't get a MPP.

1581
01:22:48,000 --> 01:22:50,000
I said I'm going to join.

1582
01:22:50,000 --> 01:22:52,000
Actually, you got two.

1583
01:22:52,000 --> 01:22:54,000
Fly held and fly killer.

1584
01:22:54,000 --> 01:22:56,000
Top accolades.

1585
01:22:56,000 --> 01:23:00,000
This thing is my most flying health medals is 41.

1586
01:23:00,000 --> 01:23:02,000
And that's because I got the flag right when the game started.

1587
01:23:02,000 --> 01:23:04,000
And I skied around for 10 minutes.

1588
01:23:04,000 --> 01:23:06,000
What did it get?

1589
01:23:06,000 --> 01:23:08,000
Why am I killing anybody either?

1590
01:23:08,000 --> 01:23:10,000
Why am I not logged into my own stream right now?

1591
01:23:10,000 --> 01:23:12,000
I just typed something.

1592
01:23:12,000 --> 01:23:14,000
How is that possible?

1593
01:23:14,000 --> 01:23:18,000
So it's oh playing team fortress too.

1594
01:23:18,000 --> 01:23:20,000
I'm absolutely not.

1595
01:23:20,000 --> 01:23:22,000
Do you want my delegate?

1596
01:23:22,000 --> 01:23:24,000
What do you do on bloody?

1597
01:23:24,000 --> 01:23:28,000
Yeah, go right when you count.

1598
01:23:28,000 --> 01:23:32,000
Is that burger boy just like click spamming?

1599
01:23:32,000 --> 01:23:34,000
Yeah, I'm trying to get in that.

1600
01:23:34,000 --> 01:23:36,000
That was your best chance.

1601
01:23:36,000 --> 01:23:38,000
Oh, no.

1602
01:23:38,000 --> 01:23:40,000
Are we going to get split up here?

1603
01:23:40,000 --> 01:23:42,000
I think we might get split up here.

1604
01:23:42,000 --> 01:23:44,000
I'll catch you guys.

1605
01:23:44,000 --> 01:23:46,000
Oh, I just made it.

1606
01:23:46,000 --> 01:23:48,000
Oh, burger boy.

1607
01:23:48,000 --> 01:23:50,000
You could have just waited.

1608
01:23:50,000 --> 01:23:52,000
You made it?

1609
01:23:52,000 --> 01:23:54,000
I made it.

1610
01:23:54,000 --> 01:23:56,000
I didn't mean I was a fly.

1611
01:23:56,000 --> 01:23:58,000
I got to change this.

1612
01:23:58,000 --> 01:24:00,000
It's just saying I'm playing tribes.

1613
01:24:00,000 --> 01:24:02,000
Try to send.

1614
01:24:02,000 --> 01:24:04,000
There we go.

1615
01:24:04,000 --> 01:24:06,000
I'm going to do it.

1616
01:24:06,000 --> 01:24:08,000
I'm going to do it.

1617
01:24:08,000 --> 01:24:10,000
Try to send.

1618
01:24:10,000 --> 01:24:12,000
There we go.

1619
01:24:12,000 --> 01:24:16,000
Broadcast updated successfully.

1620
01:24:16,000 --> 01:24:20,000
Oh, got the flag.

1621
01:24:20,000 --> 01:24:22,000
Probably not for long.

1622
01:24:22,000 --> 01:24:26,000
I'm going to go soldier this time.

1623
01:24:26,000 --> 01:24:30,000
I think that's the best idea.

1624
01:24:30,000 --> 01:24:32,000
Wow, there is no one on my team over here at all.

1625
01:24:32,000 --> 01:24:34,000
Trying to tell it's there.

1626
01:24:34,000 --> 01:24:36,000
I'm getting behind you.

1627
01:24:36,000 --> 01:24:38,000
Nice air shot.

1628
01:24:38,000 --> 01:24:40,000
Oh, burger boy made it.

1629
01:24:40,000 --> 01:24:42,000
That's it.

1630
01:24:42,000 --> 01:24:44,000
All right, let's keep going.

1631
01:24:44,000 --> 01:24:46,000
I got to go buy an arcs and buster.

1632
01:24:46,000 --> 01:24:48,000
Whatever that is.

1633
01:24:48,000 --> 01:24:52,000
It's probably stupid.

1634
01:24:52,000 --> 01:24:54,000
Oh, you bastard.

1635
01:24:54,000 --> 01:24:56,000
Where are you doing?

1636
01:24:56,000 --> 01:24:58,000
Oh, that was the sweep under the bridge.

1637
01:24:58,000 --> 01:25:00,000
Flight right there.

1638
01:25:00,000 --> 01:25:04,000
Oh, you want to go assault rifle on assault rifle or something?

1639
01:25:04,000 --> 01:25:06,000
Oh, this guy needs one hit.

1640
01:25:06,000 --> 01:25:08,000
He's dead.

1641
01:25:08,000 --> 01:25:10,000
Oh, come on.

1642
01:25:10,000 --> 01:25:12,000
There we go.

1643
01:25:12,000 --> 01:25:16,000
There we go.

1644
01:25:16,000 --> 01:25:18,000
All right, we got the flag.

1645
01:25:18,000 --> 01:25:20,000
Oh, I'm going to catch me now.

1646
01:25:20,000 --> 01:25:22,000
Right into the edge of the map over here.

1647
01:25:22,000 --> 01:25:24,000
Did we get the flag yesterday or flag?

1648
01:25:24,000 --> 01:25:26,000
Here we do.

1649
01:25:26,000 --> 01:25:28,000
Yeah, that's how it says to evil men chasing him.

1650
01:25:28,000 --> 01:25:30,000
Let's get over there.

1651
01:25:30,000 --> 01:25:32,000
Got some ninjas flying around behind me.

1652
01:25:32,000 --> 01:25:34,000
I can't believe what you're doing chasing it.

1653
01:25:34,000 --> 01:25:36,000
Oh, Talix's voice is smooth.

1654
01:25:36,000 --> 01:25:38,000
It is.

1655
01:25:38,000 --> 01:25:40,000
Somebody just said that.

1656
01:25:40,000 --> 01:25:42,000
Smooth like an erection.

1657
01:25:42,000 --> 01:25:44,000
All right, this is PG 13 Shream.

1658
01:25:44,000 --> 01:25:46,000
I was, I don't even know what that meant.

1659
01:25:46,000 --> 01:25:48,000
Yeah, how's it about the ass?

1660
01:25:48,000 --> 01:25:52,000
Oh, air shot.

1661
01:25:52,000 --> 01:25:54,000
No.

1662
01:25:54,000 --> 01:25:56,000
That guy just got me.

1663
01:25:56,000 --> 01:25:58,000
This thing doesn't go very far.

1664
01:25:58,000 --> 01:26:00,000
Forget that sometimes.

1665
01:26:00,000 --> 01:26:02,000
I'm trying to prove on the better scared.

1666
01:26:02,000 --> 01:26:04,000
Well, the classes have a lot of impact on that as well.

1667
01:26:04,000 --> 01:26:06,000
What about you?

1668
01:26:06,000 --> 01:26:08,000
Right.

1669
01:26:08,000 --> 01:26:10,000
Yeah, if you're like the fastest class, what do you have?

1670
01:26:10,000 --> 01:26:12,000
Oh, damn.

1671
01:26:12,000 --> 01:26:14,000
I am a reader.

1672
01:26:14,000 --> 01:26:16,000
Yeah, somebody behind you.

1673
01:26:16,000 --> 01:26:18,000
So I'll slow down a little bit and do them.

1674
01:26:18,000 --> 01:26:20,000
That's just this game is the person that just asked this game is free.

1675
01:26:20,000 --> 01:26:22,000
And it's an open beta.

1676
01:26:22,000 --> 01:26:24,000
I'm going to do it.

1677
01:26:24,000 --> 01:26:26,000
I'm going to do it.

1678
01:26:26,000 --> 01:26:28,000
It's the person that just asked this game is free.

1679
01:26:28,000 --> 01:26:30,000
And it's an open beta.

1680
01:26:30,000 --> 01:26:32,000
You can just play it.

1681
01:26:32,000 --> 01:26:34,000
You play it as much as you want.

1682
01:26:34,000 --> 01:26:36,000
Whatever you want.

1683
01:26:36,000 --> 01:26:40,000
And it's a game about skiing momentum and fun.

1684
01:26:40,000 --> 01:26:42,000
The ski simulation game.

1685
01:26:42,000 --> 01:26:44,000
Yes.

1686
01:26:44,000 --> 01:26:46,000
Oh, this guy smart.

1687
01:26:46,000 --> 01:26:48,000
What am I doing with this smart guy?

1688
01:26:48,000 --> 01:26:50,000
Wait till he lands.

1689
01:26:50,000 --> 01:26:52,000
Oh, I believe I've been carrying the flag this entire time.

1690
01:26:52,000 --> 01:26:54,000
I really can't.

1691
01:26:54,000 --> 01:26:56,000
I'm taking care of that.

1692
01:26:56,000 --> 01:26:58,000
Yeah.

1693
01:26:58,000 --> 01:27:00,000
Wow.

1694
01:27:00,000 --> 01:27:02,000
Uh oh.

1695
01:27:02,000 --> 01:27:06,000
Are we going to get to see some real raw burga boy rage?

1696
01:27:06,000 --> 01:27:10,000
Remember, burga boy, you can't say any like wicked horrible swiss.

1697
01:27:10,000 --> 01:27:18,000
I'm about to run into a wall.

1698
01:27:18,000 --> 01:27:20,000
Oh, I ran into a wall.

1699
01:27:20,000 --> 01:27:22,000
It's over.

1700
01:27:22,000 --> 01:27:24,000
Oh, you're going to go with this boom.

1701
01:27:24,000 --> 01:27:26,000
Oh, nice. Nice.

1702
01:27:26,000 --> 01:27:28,000
It was a good run.

1703
01:27:28,000 --> 01:27:30,000
Very nice. Very nice.

1704
01:27:30,000 --> 01:27:32,000
Berga boy's in first place.

1705
01:27:32,000 --> 01:27:34,000
Berga boy.

1706
01:27:34,000 --> 01:27:36,000
There you go.

1707
01:27:36,000 --> 01:27:38,000
Oh, yeah.

1708
01:27:38,000 --> 01:27:40,000
If that's going to get that flag right, one of our guys got the flag.

1709
01:27:40,000 --> 01:27:42,000
Oh, come on.

1710
01:27:42,000 --> 01:27:44,000
You got to get better aim.

1711
01:27:44,000 --> 01:27:46,000
Come on land.

1712
01:27:46,000 --> 01:27:48,000
Oh, I got a win on that.

1713
01:27:48,000 --> 01:27:50,000
Oh, damn.

1714
01:27:50,000 --> 01:27:52,000
Not doing so well right this second.

1715
01:27:52,000 --> 01:27:54,000
Oh, that's not.

1716
01:27:54,000 --> 01:27:56,000
Not doing so hot right there.

1717
01:27:56,000 --> 01:27:58,000
I just grenade it myself.

1718
01:27:58,000 --> 01:28:02,000
Like as fast as you move in this game, that is nearly impossible.

1719
01:28:02,000 --> 01:28:04,000
Yeah, I know.

1720
01:28:04,000 --> 01:28:06,000
All right.

1721
01:28:06,000 --> 01:28:08,000
That's crazy.

1722
01:28:08,000 --> 01:28:10,000
I'm going to be able to do it.

1723
01:28:10,000 --> 01:28:12,000
I'm going to be able to do it.

1724
01:28:12,000 --> 01:28:14,000
I'm going to be able to do it.

1725
01:28:14,000 --> 01:28:16,000
I'm going to be able to do it.

1726
01:28:16,000 --> 01:28:18,000
Yeah, I know. All right.

1727
01:28:18,000 --> 01:28:20,000
That's crazy.

1728
01:28:20,000 --> 01:28:22,000
I got that guy on the couple of shots.

1729
01:28:22,000 --> 01:28:24,000
Oh, that guy.

1730
01:28:24,000 --> 01:28:26,000
I'm doing some speed.

1731
01:28:26,000 --> 01:28:28,000
I'll get this guy.

1732
01:28:28,000 --> 01:28:30,000
I'll thump this guy.

1733
01:28:30,000 --> 01:28:32,000
I'll thump this guy.

1734
01:28:32,000 --> 01:28:34,000
I'll thump this better than thump this.

1735
01:28:34,000 --> 01:28:36,000
No, not high enough.

1736
01:28:36,000 --> 01:28:38,000
Wait, the flag is dropped.

1737
01:28:38,000 --> 01:28:40,000
I had the flag on my back.

1738
01:28:40,000 --> 01:28:42,000
Get out of the tower.

1739
01:28:42,000 --> 01:28:44,000
I blew that guy away from you guys.

1740
01:28:44,000 --> 01:28:46,000
Or I could just sit down here alone by myself.

1741
01:28:46,000 --> 01:28:48,000
I could hit it again.

1742
01:28:48,000 --> 01:28:50,000
What's going on?

1743
01:28:50,000 --> 01:28:56,000
Oh, I just got I just got air shot.

1744
01:28:56,000 --> 01:28:58,000
Damn.

1745
01:28:58,000 --> 01:29:02,000
I'll losing momentum here.

1746
01:29:02,000 --> 01:29:06,000
I just got mad air shot.

1747
01:29:06,000 --> 01:29:08,000
I'm dead.

1748
01:29:08,000 --> 01:29:10,000
I don't know how I got to lose.

1749
01:29:10,000 --> 01:29:12,000
I should play.

1750
01:29:12,000 --> 01:29:14,000
Yeah, we're doing.

1751
01:29:14,000 --> 01:29:16,000
I believe there are some grenades

1752
01:29:16,000 --> 01:29:18,000
that can make you drop stuff like the flag.

1753
01:29:18,000 --> 01:29:20,000
That's lame.

1754
01:29:20,000 --> 01:29:22,000
Actually, that's pretty cool.

1755
01:29:22,000 --> 01:29:24,000
Land on that.

1756
01:29:24,000 --> 01:29:26,000
Oh, damn it.

1757
01:29:26,000 --> 01:29:28,000
I got to get more.

1758
01:29:28,000 --> 01:29:30,000
This guy's done.

1759
01:29:30,000 --> 01:29:32,000
That a town.

1760
01:29:32,000 --> 01:29:34,000
Back off.

1761
01:29:34,000 --> 01:29:40,000
I just got killed by a blue fat.

1762
01:29:40,000 --> 01:29:42,000
Somebody just said.

1763
01:29:42,000 --> 01:29:44,000
Juggernaut?

1764
01:29:44,000 --> 01:29:48,000
Yeah, that's a juggernaut probably.

1765
01:29:48,000 --> 01:29:50,000
I might want to pull out the...

1766
01:29:50,000 --> 01:29:52,000
No, I might kill him.

1767
01:29:52,000 --> 01:29:54,000
One more shot.

1768
01:29:54,000 --> 01:29:56,000
This is the one right here.

1769
01:29:56,000 --> 01:29:58,000
Oh, no, he's not dead.

1770
01:29:58,000 --> 01:30:00,000
There we go.

1771
01:30:00,000 --> 01:30:04,000
I need to go to resupply big time.

1772
01:30:04,000 --> 01:30:06,000
Oh, ship has got a new video.

1773
01:30:06,000 --> 01:30:08,000
Reserve shooter.

1774
01:30:08,000 --> 01:30:10,000
I think it's a challenge.

1775
01:30:10,000 --> 01:30:12,000
Oh, he's on the floor of the deal.

1776
01:30:12,000 --> 01:30:14,000
Oh, yeah.

1777
01:30:14,000 --> 01:30:18,000
Flag down, baby.

1778
01:30:18,000 --> 01:30:20,000
Should I?

1779
01:30:20,000 --> 01:30:22,000
All right, we're beating him by like...

1780
01:30:22,000 --> 01:30:26,000
We have like a 100% lead on them right now.

1781
01:30:26,000 --> 01:30:30,000
Get the sky off.

1782
01:30:30,000 --> 01:30:34,000
Trying to get like hit markers on him.

1783
01:30:34,000 --> 01:30:36,000
But man, I tell you right now,

1784
01:30:36,000 --> 01:30:40,000
this game is a lot of fun.

1785
01:30:40,000 --> 01:30:42,000
I probably wouldn't have even started playing this game

1786
01:30:42,000 --> 01:30:44,000
if it was not for a tellyx.

1787
01:30:44,000 --> 01:30:46,000
Thank you, sir.

1788
01:30:46,000 --> 01:30:48,000
Thank you.

1789
01:30:48,000 --> 01:30:50,000
I was like, you got to play this game.

1790
01:30:50,000 --> 01:30:52,000
You're like, ah, whatever.

1791
01:30:52,000 --> 01:30:54,000
I was like, I'll give it a try.

1792
01:30:54,000 --> 01:30:56,000
Whatever. Probably sucks.

1793
01:30:56,000 --> 01:30:58,000
Now, this game is very, very good.

1794
01:30:58,000 --> 01:31:00,000
I saw it before a long time ago.

1795
01:31:00,000 --> 01:31:02,000
Like months ago, when people were first started talking about it.

1796
01:31:02,000 --> 01:31:04,000
And I was like, yeah, it looks okay.

1797
01:31:04,000 --> 01:31:06,000
This game is very addicting and very fun.

1798
01:31:06,000 --> 01:31:08,000
It's not what he's behind me,

1799
01:31:08,000 --> 01:31:10,000
but I don't care to turn around.

1800
01:31:10,000 --> 01:31:12,000
And it's free.

1801
01:31:12,000 --> 01:31:14,000
Yeah.

1802
01:31:14,000 --> 01:31:16,000
As a huge class right there,

1803
01:31:16,000 --> 01:31:18,000
I just went on buy games that were like 10 bucks.

1804
01:31:18,000 --> 01:31:22,000
Yeah, Burger Boy doesn't buy video games until they are $10.

1805
01:31:22,000 --> 01:31:24,000
And we're talking like Skyrim,

1806
01:31:24,000 --> 01:31:26,000
which up, but it's like Skyrim,

1807
01:31:26,000 --> 01:31:28,000
do you never gonna get that game?

1808
01:31:28,000 --> 01:31:30,000
Oh, I'm gonna get Skyrim three years from now.

1809
01:31:30,000 --> 01:31:32,000
Yeah, you're gonna get Skyrim like when you're like 35.

1810
01:31:32,000 --> 01:31:34,000
10 bucks?

1811
01:31:34,000 --> 01:31:36,000
Yeah.

1812
01:31:36,000 --> 01:31:38,000
Is it 10 bucks yet?

1813
01:31:38,000 --> 01:31:40,000
That's always that's the Burger Boy quote.

1814
01:31:40,000 --> 01:31:42,000
I'll be like, oh, hey dude, you know like Diablo 3 just came out.

1815
01:31:42,000 --> 01:31:44,000
10 bucks yet?

1816
01:31:44,000 --> 01:31:46,000
No, it's not.

1817
01:31:46,000 --> 01:31:48,000
It's like 60.

1818
01:31:48,000 --> 01:31:50,000
Oh, well, fine.

1819
01:31:50,000 --> 01:31:52,000
It's all it's like 10 bucks.

1820
01:31:52,000 --> 01:31:54,000
I'm gonna try and help you with this dude.

1821
01:31:54,000 --> 01:31:56,000
Nice.

1822
01:31:56,000 --> 01:31:58,000
Yep. He was getting on you pretty good.

1823
01:31:58,000 --> 01:32:00,000
Yeah.

1824
01:32:00,000 --> 01:32:02,000
13, I thought.

1825
01:32:02,000 --> 01:32:04,000
Yeah, all right, let me know when I'm.

1826
01:32:04,000 --> 01:32:06,000
I already feel nobody would see.

1827
01:32:06,000 --> 01:32:08,000
Right, what did you just say?

1828
01:32:08,000 --> 01:32:12,000
I really just didn't even pay attention to where you said.

1829
01:32:12,000 --> 01:32:14,000
Oh, I need to get up here.

1830
01:32:14,000 --> 01:32:16,000
I'm dead. I'm so dead.

1831
01:32:16,000 --> 01:32:18,000
Yeah, absolutely.

1832
01:32:18,000 --> 01:32:20,000
Oh, Frank and like about.

1833
01:32:20,000 --> 01:32:22,000
I got the guy for you.

1834
01:32:22,000 --> 01:32:24,000
Nice.

1835
01:32:24,000 --> 01:32:26,000
Let's see if I can give a slider with the hair strike.

1836
01:32:26,000 --> 01:32:28,000
Well, if you walk right into it.

1837
01:32:28,000 --> 01:32:30,000
Oh, no, he almost got him.

1838
01:32:30,000 --> 01:32:32,000
He was in the air.

1839
01:32:32,000 --> 01:32:34,000
He was in the air.

1840
01:32:34,000 --> 01:32:36,000
At least a look closer from over here.

1841
01:32:36,000 --> 01:32:40,000
Ah, I'm trying to get him in the air.

1842
01:32:40,000 --> 01:32:44,000
I'm not shooting far enough ahead of him.

1843
01:32:44,000 --> 01:32:48,000
No, still not shooting far enough ahead of him.

1844
01:32:48,000 --> 01:32:50,000
Oh, that could have been an air shot.

1845
01:32:50,000 --> 01:32:52,000
Come on now.

1846
01:32:52,000 --> 01:32:54,000
Mother, may I?

1847
01:32:54,000 --> 01:32:56,000
I need to wait.

1848
01:32:56,000 --> 01:32:58,000
I got to recharge like stuff here.

1849
01:32:58,000 --> 01:33:00,000
Oh, God.

1850
01:33:00,000 --> 01:33:02,000
Is that Marshall?

1851
01:33:02,000 --> 01:33:04,000
Yeah, black.

1852
01:33:04,000 --> 01:33:06,000
Here we go.

1853
01:33:06,000 --> 01:33:08,000
Victory.

1854
01:33:08,000 --> 01:33:12,000
All right, let's get our rain here.

1855
01:33:12,000 --> 01:33:14,000
First one of the day.

1856
01:33:14,000 --> 01:33:16,000
There is an area.

1857
01:33:16,000 --> 01:33:18,000
A vulnerable 12 kills.

1858
01:33:18,000 --> 01:33:20,000
Hold it.

1859
01:33:20,000 --> 01:33:22,000
A vulnerable 12 kills.

1860
01:33:22,000 --> 01:33:24,000
A vulnerable 12 kills.

1861
01:33:24,000 --> 01:33:26,000
Hold it.

1862
01:33:26,000 --> 01:33:28,000
A vulnerable, nice.

1863
01:33:28,000 --> 01:33:30,000
I would not buy Team Fortress Classic.

1864
01:33:30,000 --> 01:33:34,000
The only reason why I say that is because it's just,

1865
01:33:34,000 --> 01:33:38,000
it's very, and now it's just so difficult to play.

1866
01:33:38,000 --> 01:33:40,000
This grenade spam is, it's,

1867
01:33:40,000 --> 01:33:42,000
it's, unless it's like five dollars,

1868
01:33:42,000 --> 01:33:44,000
don't buy it.

1869
01:33:44,000 --> 01:33:46,000
I'll put it that way.

1870
01:33:46,000 --> 01:33:48,000
Winter, winter chicken dinner.

1871
01:33:48,000 --> 01:33:52,000
I think this is the first time I've ever gotten first place in

1872
01:33:52,000 --> 01:33:54,000
anything in drives.

1873
01:33:54,000 --> 01:33:56,000
Oh, right.

1874
01:33:56,000 --> 01:34:00,000
That isn't achievement in and of itself for me.

1875
01:34:00,000 --> 01:34:04,000
Not even first in the whole game.

1876
01:34:04,000 --> 01:34:08,000
This first in my team is, that's good enough.

1877
01:34:08,000 --> 01:34:10,000
All right, quick flood to bloody go.

1878
01:34:10,000 --> 01:34:12,000
Bloody go.

1879
01:34:12,000 --> 01:34:14,000
Everybody click.

1880
01:34:14,000 --> 01:34:16,000
Look at it.

1881
01:34:16,000 --> 01:34:20,000
Oh, there's a guy right here.

1882
01:34:20,000 --> 01:34:22,000
Oh, yeah, sure.

1883
01:34:22,000 --> 01:34:24,000
Nope.

1884
01:34:24,000 --> 01:34:26,000
Get the first kill.

1885
01:34:26,000 --> 01:34:28,000
That gives you that flagged death.

1886
01:34:28,000 --> 01:34:30,000
It does?

1887
01:34:30,000 --> 01:34:32,000
Yep.

1888
01:34:32,000 --> 01:34:34,000
Oh, it seems to defend on call it.

1889
01:34:34,000 --> 01:34:36,000
He never points in the federal government.

1890
01:34:36,000 --> 01:34:38,000
Hey, watch it.

1891
01:34:38,000 --> 01:34:40,000
I can't believe I didn't, oh, he's going to kill me.

1892
01:34:40,000 --> 01:34:42,000
No, Jeremy, you have to be the first kill in my first death.

1893
01:34:42,000 --> 01:34:44,000
I'm going to be the, I'm going to be the first death if I don't get Lord Chaos.

1894
01:34:44,000 --> 01:34:46,000
Damn death.

1895
01:34:46,000 --> 01:34:48,000
Wow, that was the luckiest kill I've ever had.

1896
01:34:48,000 --> 01:34:50,000
Yeah, I'll probably do videos for drives.

1897
01:34:50,000 --> 01:34:54,000
Eventually everyone, I got, I got to get familiar with it, get to go to edit.

1898
01:34:54,000 --> 01:34:56,000
But I'll probably do a few videos at least.

1899
01:34:56,000 --> 01:34:58,000
Yep.

1900
01:34:58,000 --> 01:35:02,000
Because this game is really awesome.

1901
01:35:02,000 --> 01:35:04,000
Boom.

1902
01:35:04,000 --> 01:35:06,000
The other boom, the other.

1903
01:35:06,000 --> 01:35:08,000
Where am I? I'm going the absolute wrong direction.

1904
01:35:08,000 --> 01:35:10,000
All right.

1905
01:35:10,000 --> 01:35:12,000
I'm going to get some speed here.

1906
01:35:12,000 --> 01:35:14,000
Pick it up speed, pick it up speed.

1907
01:35:14,000 --> 01:35:16,000
Got him.

1908
01:35:16,000 --> 01:35:18,000
And it's all got me.

1909
01:35:18,000 --> 01:35:20,000
Oh, we got to get that flag.

1910
01:35:20,000 --> 01:35:22,000
Got it. Somebody on our team got it.

1911
01:35:22,000 --> 01:35:24,000
MLC stealth is going to die.

1912
01:35:28,000 --> 01:35:32,000
Look at that chaos grenade into the chaos.

1913
01:35:32,000 --> 01:35:34,000
Oh, I thought I got that guy.

1914
01:35:34,000 --> 01:35:36,000
I did it by.

1915
01:35:36,000 --> 01:35:40,000
My game is just updating.

1916
01:35:40,000 --> 01:35:42,000
I'm really weird stuff.

1917
01:35:42,000 --> 01:35:48,000
Hey, when we installed it on burger boys computer is like, all his fans turned on.

1918
01:35:48,000 --> 01:35:50,000
This computer almost like.

1919
01:35:50,000 --> 01:35:54,000
Just load just random there with the surprise.

1920
01:35:54,000 --> 01:35:56,000
That is like awesome computer I have.

1921
01:35:56,000 --> 01:35:58,000
Nice shot.

1922
01:35:58,000 --> 01:36:00,000
That guy got a really good shot.

1923
01:36:00,000 --> 01:36:04,000
We've had issues that borderline, so we've had issues.

1924
01:36:04,000 --> 01:36:08,000
Burger boy borderlands.

1925
01:36:08,000 --> 01:36:12,000
Sorry, how many times have you heard burger boy like swear and say horrible things in borderlands?

1926
01:36:12,000 --> 01:36:14,000
Oh, oh god.

1927
01:36:14,000 --> 01:36:18,000
Basically he did rematch his keys for his special ability.

1928
01:36:18,000 --> 01:36:22,000
And every time we wanted to pick up an item he decided to activate his special ability.

1929
01:36:22,000 --> 01:36:30,000
And playing his break he was just screaming constantly for the entire three hours that we played at that time.

1930
01:36:30,000 --> 01:36:32,000
Worst time gather.

1931
01:36:32,000 --> 01:36:34,000
Oh, burger boy.

1932
01:36:34,000 --> 01:36:36,000
Come on, you can do better than that.

1933
01:36:36,000 --> 01:36:42,000
Oh, let's go shoddy.

1934
01:36:42,000 --> 01:36:44,000
I don't have any momentum.

1935
01:36:44,000 --> 01:36:46,000
I'm like walking around the man.

1936
01:36:46,000 --> 01:36:48,000
Oh, I got that guy.

1937
01:36:48,000 --> 01:36:50,000
Oh, I saw that.

1938
01:36:50,000 --> 01:36:52,000
Hey, you.

1939
01:36:52,000 --> 01:36:54,000
I'm gonna waste this.

1940
01:36:54,000 --> 01:36:56,000
Let's get this guy.

1941
01:36:56,000 --> 01:36:58,000
Double team.

1942
01:36:58,000 --> 01:37:02,000
Oh, I missed.

1943
01:37:02,000 --> 01:37:04,000
There we go.

1944
01:37:04,000 --> 01:37:08,000
Another guy right there.

1945
01:37:08,000 --> 01:37:10,000
Two guys.

1946
01:37:10,000 --> 01:37:14,000
770 and that's a direct shot.

1947
01:37:14,000 --> 01:37:16,000
Oh, I got a phone lover.

1948
01:37:16,000 --> 01:37:18,000
Oh, he knew it.

1949
01:37:18,000 --> 01:37:22,000
Wow, that was awesome.

1950
01:37:22,000 --> 01:37:26,000
Holy crap, that was awesome.

1951
01:37:26,000 --> 01:37:28,000
Yes.

1952
01:37:28,000 --> 01:37:32,000
And a guy threw a grenade right into my feet when I went over there and got me.

1953
01:37:32,000 --> 01:37:36,000
Two shame, I've written that was great.

1954
01:37:36,000 --> 01:37:40,000
Down.

1955
01:37:40,000 --> 01:37:44,000
Woo.

1956
01:37:44,000 --> 01:37:46,000
Ah.

1957
01:37:46,000 --> 01:37:50,000
So, general, what classes do you have in life so far?

1958
01:37:50,000 --> 01:37:52,000
Just the sniper Sentinel.

1959
01:37:52,000 --> 01:37:56,000
Nice thing about like yesterday we were talking about the,

1960
01:37:56,000 --> 01:37:58,000
like the ones that don't detonate on the impacts.

1961
01:37:58,000 --> 01:38:00,000
Yeah, they bounce around.

1962
01:38:00,000 --> 01:38:04,000
I have the grenade launcher right now and I've noticed that if you get a direct hit,

1963
01:38:04,000 --> 01:38:06,000
it's like the demo man.

1964
01:38:06,000 --> 01:38:08,000
You know, it was explode.

1965
01:38:08,000 --> 01:38:10,000
Oh, really?

1966
01:38:10,000 --> 01:38:12,000
Immediately.

1967
01:38:12,000 --> 01:38:16,000
And the nice thing about them also is that they usually do a lot more damage and have bigger radius.

1968
01:38:16,000 --> 01:38:18,000
Didn't like the spin fusers.

1969
01:38:18,000 --> 01:38:20,000
Yeah, I've noticed that the explosion is huge.

1970
01:38:20,000 --> 01:38:24,000
You just get a massive damage spike right there.

1971
01:38:24,000 --> 01:38:28,000
I keep falling in love like a video.

1972
01:38:28,000 --> 01:38:30,000
Hey, it's not like.

1973
01:38:30,000 --> 01:38:32,000
I can't help it.

1974
01:38:32,000 --> 01:38:36,000
Does anybody else feel like they're playing like Star Wars?

1975
01:38:36,000 --> 01:38:38,000
I like feeling like that.

1976
01:38:38,000 --> 01:38:40,000
Yeah.

1977
01:38:40,000 --> 01:38:42,000
What's that called?

1978
01:38:42,000 --> 01:38:44,000
I mean, even the noises like the,

1979
01:38:44,000 --> 01:38:48,000
I feel like the green room dream, it sounds like Star Wars.

1980
01:38:48,000 --> 01:38:50,000
Oh, thank you.

1981
01:38:50,000 --> 01:38:52,000
So, what are you guys favorite classes with the games?

1982
01:38:52,000 --> 01:38:56,000
I like moving fast and having zero.

1983
01:38:56,000 --> 01:38:58,000
Fast, find them.

1984
01:38:58,000 --> 01:39:02,000
Yeah, I'd probably say the fast find too.

1985
01:39:02,000 --> 01:39:04,000
Just give the shock on the cell to try and,

1986
01:39:04,000 --> 01:39:08,000
I would say a raider or infiltrator.

1987
01:39:08,000 --> 01:39:12,000
See, I don't even, I gotta get those guys.

1988
01:39:12,000 --> 01:39:14,000
I'm never again with the infiltrator yet.

1989
01:39:14,000 --> 01:39:18,000
Never been good with stealthy classes in any game.

1990
01:39:18,000 --> 01:39:20,000
That's still fun.

1991
01:39:20,000 --> 01:39:22,000
Yeah, so you can, you can cloak?

1992
01:39:22,000 --> 01:39:24,000
Oh, yeah, you can cloak.

1993
01:39:24,000 --> 01:39:28,000
And it'll, like instead of using your energy per your jet pack,

1994
01:39:28,000 --> 01:39:30,000
it'll use it for your stealth.

1995
01:39:30,000 --> 01:39:32,000
Oh, okay, that's a good trade off.

1996
01:39:32,000 --> 01:39:34,000
That's not like overpowering anything.

1997
01:39:34,000 --> 01:39:36,000
And there's a few items in my perks,

1998
01:39:36,000 --> 01:39:40,000
making up perks, but I know it's at least one or two items that

1999
01:39:40,000 --> 01:39:42,000
can detect stealth people.

2000
01:39:42,000 --> 01:39:44,000
Oh, really?

2001
01:39:44,000 --> 01:39:46,000
I don't have any of those yet.

2002
01:39:46,000 --> 01:39:48,000
Yeah, there's like 10 people around me.

2003
01:39:54,000 --> 01:39:56,000
Skate down here.

2004
01:39:56,000 --> 01:39:58,000
Oh, Tony Hawk presents, tribes is in.

2005
01:40:00,000 --> 01:40:02,000
Do a kick flip.

2006
01:40:02,000 --> 01:40:04,000
Okay.

2007
01:40:04,000 --> 01:40:06,000
All right, I'm gonna do like a shaky 200.

2008
01:40:06,000 --> 01:40:08,000
Oh, that's like 25 points.

2009
01:40:08,000 --> 01:40:10,000
All right, I gotta get some speed.

2010
01:40:10,000 --> 01:40:14,000
Yeah, I cannot catch up to the kick flag carrier.

2011
01:40:14,000 --> 01:40:16,000
Oh, it's right down here.

2012
01:40:16,000 --> 01:40:18,000
Straight.

2013
01:40:18,000 --> 01:40:20,000
Try and cut him off.

2014
01:40:20,000 --> 01:40:22,000
Hey, burger boy, come.

2015
01:40:22,000 --> 01:40:24,000
How did you know it was him?

2016
01:40:24,000 --> 01:40:26,000
How did you know he read that?

2017
01:40:26,000 --> 01:40:28,000
Hey, go right back.

2018
01:40:28,000 --> 01:40:30,000
I'm gonna like a stream.

2019
01:40:30,000 --> 01:40:32,000
I know Jerma's ringtone,

2020
01:40:32,000 --> 01:40:36,000
and I'm pretty sure burger boy's going to always be on his stomach right now.

2021
01:40:36,000 --> 01:40:38,000
What if the talisman?

2022
01:40:38,000 --> 01:40:40,000
I didn't think he would.

2023
01:40:40,000 --> 01:40:42,000
I thought it does more of a burger boy thing to have his stomach on him.

2024
01:40:42,000 --> 01:40:44,000
What that means about you?

2025
01:40:44,000 --> 01:40:46,000
Do you mean that?

2026
01:40:46,000 --> 01:40:48,000
Oh, yeah, I got flag.

2027
01:40:48,000 --> 01:40:50,000
Hey, we're losing.

2028
01:40:50,000 --> 01:40:52,000
Yeah, I got flag.

2029
01:40:52,000 --> 01:40:54,000
Just protecting me.

2030
01:40:54,000 --> 01:40:56,000
What I want, what I want?

2031
01:40:56,000 --> 01:40:58,000
Oh, I'm gonna lose speed right now.

2032
01:40:58,000 --> 01:41:00,000
I'm gonna be sitting duck in two seconds.

2033
01:41:00,000 --> 01:41:02,000
I'm gonna be your body shield.

2034
01:41:02,000 --> 01:41:06,000
Oh, my God, there's a whole crew just following you.

2035
01:41:06,000 --> 01:41:08,000
Did I kill that guy?

2036
01:41:08,000 --> 01:41:10,000
Oh, finally, cheese.

2037
01:41:10,000 --> 01:41:12,000
Oh, my God.

2038
01:41:12,000 --> 01:41:14,000
Oh, yeah, I got one up for you.

2039
01:41:14,000 --> 01:41:16,000
Oh, I'm dead. I got to kill though.

2040
01:41:18,000 --> 01:41:20,000
Good, man.

2041
01:41:20,000 --> 01:41:22,000
I got another kill.

2042
01:41:22,000 --> 01:41:28,000
I know I'm gonna land right on top of everybody that's right there.

2043
01:41:28,000 --> 01:41:30,000
Oh, no.

2044
01:41:30,000 --> 01:41:32,000
Maybe that's like, I've read right by it.

2045
01:41:32,000 --> 01:41:34,000
Oh, no.

2046
01:41:34,000 --> 01:41:36,000
Oh, that bastard got it.

2047
01:41:36,000 --> 01:41:38,000
No.

2048
01:41:38,000 --> 01:41:40,000
Oh, we'll get the shotgun up.

2049
01:41:40,000 --> 01:41:44,000
Oh, damn.

2050
01:41:44,000 --> 01:41:46,000
The shotgun.

2051
01:41:46,000 --> 01:41:48,000
That's weapon in this game.

2052
01:41:48,000 --> 01:41:50,000
Yeah, I didn't pull it out early enough.

2053
01:41:50,000 --> 01:41:52,000
I should have pulled it out way earlier.

2054
01:41:52,000 --> 01:41:54,000
Oh, it's Alex. Don't die.

2055
01:41:54,000 --> 01:41:56,000
I got him.

2056
01:41:56,000 --> 01:41:58,000
I got him, man.

2057
01:41:58,000 --> 01:42:00,000
Almost died.

2058
01:42:00,000 --> 01:42:02,000
I have 13 health.

2059
01:42:02,000 --> 01:42:04,000
My strength.

2060
01:42:04,000 --> 01:42:06,000
I'm not saying you're destroying.

2061
01:42:06,000 --> 01:42:10,000
I think I just blew that guy's grenade up in mid-air in front of him.

2062
01:42:10,000 --> 01:42:12,000
I think that's actually what just happened.

2063
01:42:12,000 --> 01:42:14,000
Where is the flag?

2064
01:42:14,000 --> 01:42:16,000
I don't know. We don't have it.

2065
01:42:16,000 --> 01:42:18,000
It's a pretty close game right now.

2066
01:42:18,000 --> 01:42:20,000
I can't live this.

2067
01:42:20,000 --> 01:42:24,000
Oh, I just totally stole that from your burger, boy.

2068
01:42:24,000 --> 01:42:28,000
Bailey is so tough but so satisfying when you get it.

2069
01:42:28,000 --> 01:42:32,000
I only do like an 8k people or like snipers.

2070
01:42:32,000 --> 01:42:34,000
Someone's like-

2071
01:42:34,000 --> 01:42:35,000
Someone's like-

2072
01:42:35,000 --> 01:42:37,000
Are they hats in this game?

2073
01:42:37,000 --> 01:42:39,000
Yeah.

2074
01:42:39,000 --> 01:42:41,000
I wouldn't-

2075
01:42:41,000 --> 01:42:43,000
Don't put a past in, man.

2076
01:42:43,000 --> 01:42:47,000
This game could have a lot of items in the coming future.

2077
01:42:47,000 --> 01:42:49,000
It's a guy with a pretty close.

2078
01:42:49,000 --> 01:42:51,000
Got him. I got the flag guy.

2079
01:42:51,000 --> 01:42:53,000
You got the flag?

2080
01:42:53,000 --> 01:42:55,000
We're going to lose.

2081
01:42:55,000 --> 01:42:57,000
We're going to lose.

2082
01:42:57,000 --> 01:42:59,000
Try and cut this flag guy off.

2083
01:42:59,000 --> 01:43:01,000
Yeah, we're going to lose.

2084
01:43:01,000 --> 01:43:03,000
It's a done deal.

2085
01:43:03,000 --> 01:43:04,000
Cut him off.

2086
01:43:04,000 --> 01:43:06,000
That guy's out of speed.

2087
01:43:06,000 --> 01:43:08,000
That guy's out of speed.

2088
01:43:08,000 --> 01:43:10,000
7 to 24. I think it's over.

2089
01:43:10,000 --> 01:43:12,000
5.

2090
01:43:12,000 --> 01:43:14,000
Oh yeah.

2091
01:43:14,000 --> 01:43:16,000
Oh yeah, it's absolutely over.

2092
01:43:16,000 --> 01:43:18,000
Somebody called in the nuke.

2093
01:43:18,000 --> 01:43:20,000
Oh.

2094
01:43:20,000 --> 01:43:22,000
Wait, no. I had 10,000 credits but I called in an inventory station instead.

2095
01:43:22,000 --> 01:43:28,000
MLC has killed me 15 times in a row. That's how he said.

2096
01:43:28,000 --> 01:43:30,000
I feel like a retarget.

2097
01:43:30,000 --> 01:43:32,000
I was supposed to call an orbital strike but I called him the inventory station.

2098
01:43:32,000 --> 01:43:34,000
Sorry, does nobody die?

2099
01:43:34,000 --> 01:43:36,000
Give me that flag.

2100
01:43:36,000 --> 01:43:38,000
No.

2101
01:43:38,000 --> 01:43:42,000
Oh, all right.

2102
01:43:42,000 --> 01:43:46,000
I think I probably one more round maybe.

2103
01:43:46,000 --> 01:43:50,000
You guys want to play CTF or just keep doing this?

2104
01:43:50,000 --> 01:43:52,000
I don't know. CTF can be very, very long.

2105
01:43:52,000 --> 01:43:56,000
So I'll just do one more of this.

2106
01:43:56,000 --> 01:43:58,000
You were here yet already?

2107
01:43:58,000 --> 01:44:00,000
You gave the game loaded?

2108
01:44:00,000 --> 01:44:02,000
45 seconds.

2109
01:44:02,000 --> 01:44:06,000
He says 20 minutes ago.

2110
01:44:06,000 --> 01:44:08,000
I don't know where he's.

2111
01:44:08,000 --> 01:44:12,000
I mean, I got this game when Beta first was announced for this.

2112
01:44:12,000 --> 01:44:14,000
I signed up for this like this in Firefall.

2113
01:44:14,000 --> 01:44:16,000
I signed up for like years ago.

2114
01:44:16,000 --> 01:44:18,000
Yeah.

2115
01:44:18,000 --> 01:44:20,000
Firefall is incredible.

2116
01:44:20,000 --> 01:44:22,000
I got the beta for that as well.

2117
01:44:22,000 --> 01:44:24,000
It's so jealous.

2118
01:44:24,000 --> 01:44:26,000
It's only two times a week though.

2119
01:44:26,000 --> 01:44:28,000
You can only have gone in those two periods.

2120
01:44:28,000 --> 01:44:30,000
It's a year and one for you.

2121
01:44:30,000 --> 01:44:32,000
But it is insane.

2122
01:44:32,000 --> 01:44:34,000
It's looking like an incredible game.

2123
01:44:34,000 --> 01:44:36,000
If you get a chance to get it.

2124
01:44:36,000 --> 01:44:38,000
What is 544?

2125
01:44:38,000 --> 01:44:40,000
It's another free to play game coming out.

2126
01:44:40,000 --> 01:44:44,000
It was like the highlight of the 3th past year.

2127
01:44:44,000 --> 01:44:48,000
How can you describe it?

2128
01:44:48,000 --> 01:44:50,000
How can you describe it?

2129
01:44:50,000 --> 01:44:52,000
What is it called?

2130
01:44:52,000 --> 01:44:54,000
Firefall.

2131
01:44:54,000 --> 01:44:56,000
I thought someone said 544.

2132
01:44:56,000 --> 01:44:58,000
Oh, okay.

2133
01:44:58,000 --> 01:45:00,000
When are you going to get 54421?

2134
01:45:00,000 --> 01:45:04,000
It burns you and then fall as it falling.

2135
01:45:04,000 --> 01:45:06,000
Sorry, English accent.

2136
01:45:06,000 --> 01:45:08,000
I'm going to come across great.

2137
01:45:08,000 --> 01:45:10,000
I'm just hitting it.

2138
01:45:10,000 --> 01:45:12,000
Firefall is like, okay, dimension.

2139
01:45:12,000 --> 01:45:14,000
Oh, fire.

2140
01:45:14,000 --> 01:45:16,000
We played that attack East last year.

2141
01:45:16,000 --> 01:45:18,000
Yeah, that's the one.

2142
01:45:18,000 --> 01:45:20,000
Yeah, 54421.

2143
01:45:20,000 --> 01:45:24,000
It looks like Borderlands with an MMO.

2144
01:45:24,000 --> 01:45:26,000
And then Open World.

2145
01:45:26,000 --> 01:45:28,000
And then Awesome Mart Style.

2146
01:45:28,000 --> 01:45:32,000
And the art style is absolutely beautiful.

2147
01:45:32,000 --> 01:45:34,000
It's one of the most stunning games I've seen in beta.

2148
01:45:34,000 --> 01:45:36,000
It looks good as it is.

2149
01:45:36,000 --> 01:45:38,000
Yeah, right.

2150
01:45:38,000 --> 01:45:40,000
That's cool.

2151
01:45:40,000 --> 01:45:42,000
Oh, this guy's going to land on that.

2152
01:45:42,000 --> 01:45:44,000
No, he's not.

2153
01:45:44,000 --> 01:45:46,000
Get blasted.

2154
01:45:46,000 --> 01:45:48,000
Come on.

2155
01:45:48,000 --> 01:45:50,000
Oh, yeah.

2156
01:45:50,000 --> 01:45:52,000
Oh, why am I sure he's over here with being the flag guy?

2157
01:45:52,000 --> 01:45:54,000
I'm going after him.

2158
01:45:54,000 --> 01:45:56,000
Let's just do it down here.

2159
01:45:56,000 --> 01:45:58,000
What?

2160
01:45:58,000 --> 01:46:00,000
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh.

2161
01:46:00,000 --> 01:46:02,000
Playing Juggernaut.

2162
01:46:02,000 --> 01:46:04,000
I'm okay.

2163
01:46:04,000 --> 01:46:06,000
I'm going to get better with him.

2164
01:46:06,000 --> 01:46:10,000
Oh, come on.

2165
01:46:10,000 --> 01:46:12,000
Walk into that.

2166
01:46:12,000 --> 01:46:16,000
This guy is standing still.

2167
01:46:16,000 --> 01:46:20,000
Oh, I just got that guy in the air with everything.

2168
01:46:20,000 --> 01:46:22,000
I'm going to get a stick.

2169
01:46:22,000 --> 01:46:24,000
Did anyone else do that?

2170
01:46:24,000 --> 01:46:26,000
Yeah, I did.

2171
01:46:26,000 --> 01:46:28,000
I was watching him come out.

2172
01:46:28,000 --> 01:46:30,000
I was like 15 feet above the guy.

2173
01:46:30,000 --> 01:46:34,000
I just like look in front of him and just like pop the grenade right on his back.

2174
01:46:34,000 --> 01:46:36,000
And he dropped the flag.

2175
01:46:36,000 --> 01:46:38,000
Oh, maybe.

2176
01:46:38,000 --> 01:46:40,000
Got Chosen right behind you, Talik.

2177
01:46:40,000 --> 01:46:42,000
He's dead now.

2178
01:46:42,000 --> 01:46:44,000
Somebody behind me now, I think.

2179
01:46:44,000 --> 01:46:46,000
Is that you guys?

2180
01:46:46,000 --> 01:46:48,000
Get him?

2181
01:46:48,000 --> 01:46:49,000
Open Sun, I'm getting more.

2182
01:46:49,000 --> 01:46:53,000
Oh, boy.

2183
01:46:53,000 --> 01:46:55,000
Come on, land, land.

2184
01:46:55,000 --> 01:46:57,000
Nice shot, dude.

2185
01:46:57,000 --> 01:47:01,000
It's like a ballet of death right there, Journal.

2186
01:47:01,000 --> 01:47:03,000
You're on me.

2187
01:47:03,000 --> 01:47:05,000
Shies.

2188
01:47:05,000 --> 01:47:07,000
I'm dead.

2189
01:47:07,000 --> 01:47:09,000
I'm not going to do about it.

2190
01:47:09,000 --> 01:47:11,000
You're right next to me.

2191
01:47:11,000 --> 01:47:13,000
What?

2192
01:47:13,000 --> 01:47:15,000
Oh, well, where is he?

2193
01:47:15,000 --> 01:47:17,000
I'm going to get you guys to my friend's list.

2194
01:47:17,000 --> 01:47:19,000
I get him to walk into this grenade.

2195
01:47:19,000 --> 01:47:21,000
He's going too fast.

2196
01:47:21,000 --> 01:47:23,000
Where'd he go?

2197
01:47:23,000 --> 01:47:25,000
I just launched him somewhere.

2198
01:47:25,000 --> 01:47:27,000
Great. Where the hell is he?

2199
01:47:27,000 --> 01:47:29,000
Oh, of course. He's right next to me.

2200
01:47:29,000 --> 01:47:31,000
Got like two people behind you, Jerma.

2201
01:47:31,000 --> 01:47:35,000
Yeah, I'm trying to go. I'm trying to go for this oppressing.

2202
01:47:35,000 --> 01:47:37,000
I'm stuck. I'm stuck. I'm going to die.

2203
01:47:37,000 --> 01:47:39,000
I'm so dead. I'm like on the ground.

2204
01:47:39,000 --> 01:47:41,000
Nope. Nope. You've got it.

2205
01:47:41,000 --> 01:47:43,000
You've got it.

2206
01:47:43,000 --> 01:47:45,000
Oh, you just saved my life right there.

2207
01:47:45,000 --> 01:47:47,000
What's my graphics card?

2208
01:47:47,000 --> 01:47:51,000
I use a GTX 470.

2209
01:47:51,000 --> 01:47:53,000
In video.

2210
01:47:53,000 --> 01:47:55,000
It's good.

2211
01:47:55,000 --> 01:47:57,000
I wouldn't really recommend it.

2212
01:47:57,000 --> 01:47:59,000
If you're going to get a new graphics card, don't get the 400 series.

2213
01:47:59,000 --> 01:48:01,000
Because the 400 series, at least the 470 and the 480.

2214
01:48:01,000 --> 01:48:05,000
They heat up way too much.

2215
01:48:05,000 --> 01:48:07,000
They are not recommended.

2216
01:48:07,000 --> 01:48:09,000
They're good cards.

2217
01:48:09,000 --> 01:48:13,000
But they can get to be like 80, 90 degrees Celsius.

2218
01:48:13,000 --> 01:48:17,000
That's not really that good for your computer.

2219
01:48:21,000 --> 01:48:25,000
York, I did play Globla Gender.

2220
01:48:25,000 --> 01:48:29,000
I have something like 700 hours.

2221
01:48:29,000 --> 01:48:31,000
I think clocked in on that game.

2222
01:48:31,000 --> 01:48:33,000
On global agenda?

2223
01:48:33,000 --> 01:48:37,000
Yeah, I've got. I used to play both the ensues used to play it like seriously.

2224
01:48:37,000 --> 01:48:39,000
Global agenda is different.

2225
01:48:39,000 --> 01:48:41,000
I think in global offensive.

2226
01:48:41,000 --> 01:48:43,000
No, no, global agenda.

2227
01:48:43,000 --> 01:48:45,000
I was before it was free.

2228
01:48:45,000 --> 01:48:47,000
We bought it and we played it.

2229
01:48:47,000 --> 01:48:51,000
Oh, god, we put in hours into that game.

2230
01:48:51,000 --> 01:48:55,000
Then it all went downhill after a while when they went free.

2231
01:48:55,000 --> 01:48:57,000
They built tribes instead.

2232
01:48:57,000 --> 01:49:01,000
They took all their money out of global agenda and put it into tribes instead.

2233
01:49:01,000 --> 01:49:03,000
That's where the end.

2234
01:49:03,000 --> 01:49:05,000
That's cool.

2235
01:49:05,000 --> 01:49:07,000
What was global agenda?

2236
01:49:07,000 --> 01:49:09,000
It was a similar game.

2237
01:49:09,000 --> 01:49:11,000
It was a good concept.

2238
01:49:11,000 --> 01:49:13,000
It needed to be made by a bigger company.

2239
01:49:13,000 --> 01:49:15,000
If that makes sense.

2240
01:49:15,000 --> 01:49:17,000
It does.

2241
01:49:17,000 --> 01:49:19,000
Like APB, I guess.

2242
01:49:19,000 --> 01:49:21,000
APB could have been.

2243
01:49:21,000 --> 01:49:23,000
I don't know how to do that.

2244
01:49:23,000 --> 01:49:27,000
APB went into the crapper, didn't it?

2245
01:49:27,000 --> 01:49:29,000
They ran out of money or something?

2246
01:49:29,000 --> 01:49:31,000
They were in so much debt.

2247
01:49:31,000 --> 01:49:33,000
It was just like, oh, free game.

2248
01:49:33,000 --> 01:49:35,000
We'll buy you.

2249
01:49:35,000 --> 01:49:37,000
It just made it free for everybody.

2250
01:49:37,000 --> 01:49:39,000
It just went downhill from then on in.

2251
01:49:39,000 --> 01:49:41,000
There is no health kit.

2252
01:49:41,000 --> 01:49:45,000
By the way, there is no health kit in this game.

2253
01:49:45,000 --> 01:49:49,000
Oh, it's itself.

2254
01:49:49,000 --> 01:49:53,000
I think we're going to win.

2255
01:49:53,000 --> 01:49:55,000
Absolutely.

2256
01:49:55,000 --> 01:49:57,000
I had the flag of the entire game.

2257
01:49:57,000 --> 01:49:59,000
That guy just went standing around.

2258
01:49:59,000 --> 01:50:01,000
I'm going to come with me with this.

2259
01:50:01,000 --> 01:50:03,000
Oh, good news.

2260
01:50:03,000 --> 01:50:05,000
That was just beautiful.

2261
01:50:13,000 --> 01:50:17,000
That's a sniper execution.

2262
01:50:17,000 --> 01:50:19,000
Pretty sharp, gorgeous.

2263
01:50:23,000 --> 01:50:27,000
Oh, I got it.

2264
01:50:27,000 --> 01:50:29,000
I don't need it.

2265
01:50:29,000 --> 01:50:31,000
That was an air shot.

2266
01:50:31,000 --> 01:50:35,000
Oh, that was a pretty close air shot. I don't know if I would really count that

2267
01:50:39,000 --> 01:50:47,000
I'd get the more ammo and come back fight. Oh, blah. Oh, I got a four core quad core four cores

2268
01:50:57,000 --> 01:50:59,000
Oh, that was interesting I guess what I just did

2269
01:51:01,000 --> 01:51:07,000
The spin fuser. Are you still carrying the flag?

2270
01:51:07,000 --> 01:51:13,000
I'll see. Yeah, this guy just walking right he's like right by you say whatever I'm gonna come and chase you

2271
01:51:14,000 --> 01:51:16,000
Next I'm gonna come back to you

2272
01:51:16,000 --> 01:51:19,000
You're all right. Are you dead? What's what are you doing still? Oh?

2273
01:51:20,000 --> 01:51:22,000
No, yeah, I

2274
01:51:22,000 --> 01:51:24,000
Probably my fourth my problem. Oh

2275
01:51:25,000 --> 01:51:27,000
You got to do oh you got people on you now

2276
01:51:28,000 --> 01:51:30,000
Oh, did they finally figure out how the game was played?

2277
01:51:31,000 --> 01:51:34,000
If I could not be such a slug I would come over there

2278
01:51:36,000 --> 01:51:40,000
All right, they're not gonna be able to cap off juggernaut. Why do you forsake me?

2279
01:51:42,000 --> 01:51:49,000
Oh, you're a juggernaut. No, what do you can't keep up? I know I'm pretty much like in molasses right now

2280
01:51:54,000 --> 01:51:56,000
No, he's dead

2281
01:51:56,000 --> 01:51:57,000
Oh

2282
01:51:57,000 --> 01:52:02,000
They're trying to slide me. Yeah, they got a couple of snipers actually the most

2283
01:52:02,000 --> 01:52:05,000
All right, let's get some fun f in speed here

2284
01:52:09,000 --> 01:52:11,000
Well live

2285
01:52:13,000 --> 01:52:15,000
I look at that slug. I

2286
01:52:15,000 --> 01:52:17,000
missed him I

2287
01:52:17,000 --> 01:52:21,000
Can't even like go chase it me either. I'm like the heavy weapons guy

2288
01:52:21,000 --> 01:52:23,000
Oh

2289
01:52:23,000 --> 01:52:26,000
That's a character in swole to laugh. No, that's right. Oh

2290
01:52:28,000 --> 01:52:32,000
I finally died. Oh, wait. Am I actually gonna like move more than like two miles for our own?

2291
01:52:34,000 --> 01:52:38,000
Oh, so what else picked up the flag? Oh great. I'm going in the opposite direction that everybody is

2292
01:52:40,000 --> 01:52:46,000
All right, as enough. I'm changing the pathfinder. Oh my fine bag time to commit suicide

2293
01:52:48,000 --> 01:52:50,000
That didn't even kill me

2294
01:52:51,000 --> 01:52:55,000
Oh, what's that it's a big bouncing blue green ball oh

2295
01:52:57,000 --> 01:53:00,000
Wonder why is that you the flight? No, that's the clay. Oh

2296
01:53:01,000 --> 01:53:03,000
So beautiful. I'm going this way

2297
01:53:04,000 --> 01:53:09,000
MLG grandpa is on an offseason right now. It'll be back in probably a couple weeks. I'm assuming

2298
01:53:12,000 --> 01:53:14,000
I'm gonna go help protect the flag carrier

2299
01:53:15,000 --> 01:53:17,000
Oh

2300
01:53:20,000 --> 01:53:22,000
You

2301
01:53:25,000 --> 01:53:28,000
If you hit one of those water guys who's when they're going off, but it'll actually give you like a 10 air

2302
01:53:30,000 --> 01:53:33,000
Really? Yeah, it's gonna be see them they like going off on the mountains

2303
01:53:35,000 --> 01:53:40,000
The best thing I have started this one and the one I'm gonna play next and the worst ones I love one how we just got done playing

2304
01:53:41,000 --> 01:53:43,000
That's my opinion

2305
01:53:45,000 --> 01:53:47,000
I like for castle on the best

2306
01:53:51,000 --> 01:53:54,000
Oh, what did you put what just hit me

2307
01:53:57,000 --> 01:53:59,000
That guy doesn't gotta uh

2308
01:54:03,000 --> 01:54:05,000
Just go on this way

2309
01:54:07,000 --> 01:54:09,000
Guys on the top

2310
01:54:10,000 --> 01:54:12,000
You

2311
01:54:13,000 --> 01:54:15,000

2312
01:54:15,000 --> 01:54:18,000
Yeah, sweet sweet grenade bliss

2313
01:54:22,000 --> 01:54:26,000
Dremel you have 10,000 credits easier super duper

2314
01:54:27,000 --> 01:54:29,000
Okay

2315
01:54:31,000 --> 01:54:35,000
Uh, you have like yeah, three four five. I'm just gonna shoot it randomly over here

2316
01:54:36,000 --> 01:54:38,000
See if I end the game

2317
01:54:38,000 --> 01:54:45,000
I don't even help how big it's all over the country. I think I end of it with my strike over. I'll start to shoot

2318
01:54:45,000 --> 01:54:50,000
Yeah, I got like four or five kills of them. Hey 31 flag health medals

2319
01:54:52,000 --> 01:54:53,000
Sick

2320
01:54:53,000 --> 01:54:56,000
Simpsist 99 yes, Alex is on that server. Yeah

2321
01:55:02,000 --> 01:55:04,000
Oh

2322
01:55:05,000 --> 01:55:08,000
All right, though. I think that's uh, that's gonna be it to the stream

2323
01:55:09,000 --> 01:55:11,000
First place second place third place at place

2324
01:55:12,000 --> 01:55:14,000

2347
01:56:50,000 --> 01:56:55,000
Whenever youtube decides to process it who knows how long that's gonna take but yeah

2348
01:56:55,000 --> 01:56:58,000
It's ended on this one last one. Come on

2349
01:56:59,000 --> 01:57:02,000
Now I'm going backwards going backwards. That's not what I want to do

2350
01:57:05,000 --> 01:57:07,000

2351
01:57:09,000 --> 01:57:11,000

2353
01:57:17,000 --> 01:57:23,000
Yeah, feel like I'm doing a dance move like sticky left leg out for your left leg down

2354
01:57:25,000 --> 01:57:27,000

01:57:29,000 --> 01:57:31,000
Hmm, I can't I can't go forward

2356
01:57:32,000 --> 01:57:37,000

2357
01:57:39,000 --> 01:57:41,000
And that's when we fall backwards

2358
01:57:43,000 --> 01:57:45,000
